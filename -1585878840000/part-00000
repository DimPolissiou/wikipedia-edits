Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> As a founder of organic architecture, Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=777}}</ref> \n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as \"the greatest American architect of all time.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed [[World Heritage Site]] as ''[[The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright]].''\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]] and [[Louis Sullivan]].  He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893, and developed an influential home and studio in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] in 1898. His colorful personal life made headlines: leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin, and their children for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]], the murders by an employee at his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.\n\n==Early years==\n===Ancestry===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]]. Family records show that he was christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" (possibly in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) when born on June 8, 1867. Writer [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that the family name \"Lloyd\" was used shortly thereafter,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-fhnSK26vMC&pg=PT12&dq=frank+lincoln+wright&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCweLMnuPmAhVMZc0KHahfDfUQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=frank%20lincoln%20wright&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life|last=Huxtable|first=Ada Louise|date=2008-04-29|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4406-3173-3|language=en}}</ref> but biographer [[Meryle Secrest]] claims that Wright himself adopted \"Lloyd\" at 18, after his parents' divorce in 1884.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7ZB90XmTdcC&pg=PA79&dq=frank+lloyd+wright+name+change&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGhsftruPmAhVKXc0KHQdZD7QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20lloyd%20wright%20name%20change&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-74414-8|language=en}}</ref> \n\nWright's father, William Cary Wright (1825\u20131904), was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.<ref name=\":1\" />  He was also a published composer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimber|first=Marian Wilson|date=2014|title=Various Artists.

Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones clan who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}</ref> In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.\n\nIn 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top\u2026 and played\u2026 with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u2026 All are in my fingers to this day\u2026 \"<ref>Alofsin, Anthony (1993).

They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.\n\nSoon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. In 1884 William sued for a divorce from Anna on the grounds of \"\u2026 emotional cruelty and physical violence and spousal abandonment.\"<ref> Hendrickson, Paul, ''Plagued By Fire'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 2019, p. 399</ref> William left Wisconsin after the divorce was granted in 1885.

University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887\u20131888)===\nIn 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of Joseph Lyman Silsbee.<ref name=Wright /> Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee\u2014accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor\u2014on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.<ref name=FLWF /> While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.<ref name=OGorman /> Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.\n\nFeeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee\u2014this time with a raise in salary.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}</ref> Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more \"gracefully picturesque\" than the other \"brutalities\" of the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}</ref> Wright aspired for more progressive work.\n\n===Adler & Sullivan (1888\u20131893)===\n\nWright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Adler & Sullivan]] was \"looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}</ref> Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}</ref> Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his own employees, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89\u201394}}</ref> In spite of this, \"Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility.\" As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for \"Dear Master\").<ref name=Tafel /> He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller in the construction of several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.<ref name=Saint />\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]\n\nOn June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin (1871\u20131959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: \"Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?\"<ref name=\"Wright 2005, p. 97\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}</ref> With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.<ref name=Weil />\n\nBy 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.<ref name=Saint/><ref name=Gebhard /> Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler & Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.<ref name=Gebhard/> During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Lind />\n\n[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]\n\nDespite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These \"bootlegged\" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs with the residential projects for Adler & Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.<ref name=Lind/> Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He \"threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler & Sullivan office never to return.\" Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}</ref> However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.<ref name=Lind/><ref>{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}</ref> Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.\n\n===Transition and experimentation (1893\u20131900)===\nAfter leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler & Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}</ref> These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.<ref name=Brooks /> They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.<ref name=Cassidy /><ref name=MIT />\n\n[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]\n\nWright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56\u2013109}}</ref> While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]\n\nSoon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the \u00c9cole lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref name=Goldberger />\n\n[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]\n\nWright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio embodied Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which his next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Prairie style houses (1900\u20131914)===\nBy 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: <blockquote> \"[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!\"<ref>''My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright,'' by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arthur Heurtley House (1902), Oak Park, IL.JPG|thumb|[[Arthur Heurtley House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1902)]]\n[[File:Darwin D.

Martin House]], [[Buffalo, New York]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Hillside Home School, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902)]]\n\nBetween 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the \"[[Prairie style]]\". Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.<ref name=Clayton /> Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.<ref name=Sommer /><ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}</ref> At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" and \"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.<ref name=Clayton/> Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904. Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \"cornerstone of modernism\".\n\nWright's residential designs of this era were known as \"prairie houses\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials\u2014especially stone and wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, shifting his focus to a more democratic architecture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226776200 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}</ref> Wright went to Europe in 1909 with a portfolio of his work and presented it to Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth]].<ref>Secrest, p. 202</ref>  ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', published in 1911, was the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe.

Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space. [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]\n\nOther early notable public buildings included the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (1905) as well as the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).\n\n===Textile concrete block system===\nIn the early 1920s, Wright designed a \"[[Textile block house|textile]]\" concrete block system reinforced by an internal system of bars. The system of precast blocks, he wrote, enabled \"fabrication as infinite in color, texture, and variety as in that rug.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KiaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wright+critical+writings#v=onepage&q=wright%20critical%20writings&f=false|title=The Essential Frank Lloyd Wright: Critical Writings on Architecture|last=Wright|first=Frank Lloyd|date=2008|editor-last=Pfeiffer|editor-first=Bruce Brooks|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=May 7, 2019|isbn=9780691146324}}</ref> Wright first used his textile block system on the [[Millard House]] in Pasadena , California, in 1923.

As he explained in ''The Natural House'' (1954), \"The original blocks are made on the site by ramming concrete into wood or metal wrap-around forms, with one outside face (which may be pattered), and one rear or inside face, generally coffered, for lightness.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Midlife problems==\n\n===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===\n[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\nIn 1903, while Wright was designing a house for Edwin Cheney (a neighbor in Oak Park), he became enamored with Cheney's wife, Mamah. [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. Their relationship became the talk of the town; they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. In 1909, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright remained in Europe for almost a year, first in [[Florence, Italy]] (where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd) and, later, in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, \"''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''\" (\"The Truth Against the World\"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===\nOn August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" />\n\n===Divorce and further troubles===\nIn 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude \"Miriam\" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.\n\nOn April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.<ref>Secrest, p. 315\u2013317.</ref> Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home \"Taliesin III\".\n\nIn 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].<ref>Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, \"[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]\"</ref> The charges were later dropped.\n\nWright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927. Wright was again required to wait for one year before remarrying.

He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including walls composed of a \"sandwich\" of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper\u2014a significant change from typically framed walls.<ref>Twombly, p.242</ref> Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.\n\nUsonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.<ref>Twombly, p.257</ref> As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.<ref>Twombly, p.244</ref> Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.\n\n===Significant later works===\n[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]\n\n[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''[[Fallingwater]]'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.\n\n[[Taliesin West]], Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.\nWright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&nbsp;years (1943\u20131959)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.\n\n[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]\nThe only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] \u2014 ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The \"as-built\" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|accessdate=May 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project.

He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for \"Prism Glass Tiles\" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.<ref>http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/</ref> Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.<ref name=\"TMCnet\">{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright. \"In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials\u2014Glass\". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.</ref> One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}</ref>\n\nWright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]\nWright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization \"a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,\" and \"a form of refined gangsterism.\" When an associate referred to him as \"an old amateur\" Wright confirmed, \"I am the oldest.\"<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:\n# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)\n# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life\n# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])\n# Japanese art, prints and buildings\n# [[Froebel Gifts]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=March 1, 1989|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24\u201337|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808|jstor=990404}}</ref>\n\nHe also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.<ref>Griffin, Marion Mahony, ''The Magic of America'', typescript, 1947</ref> As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].\n\nThe Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.\n\nLater, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], [[William Bernoudy]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\n===Community planning===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.<ref>''Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs'', Charles E. and Berdeana Aguar, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p.344</ref>\n\nHis thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E. Roberts]] entitled the \"Quadruple Block Plan.\" This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. The houses, which used the same design as published in \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" from the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the ''Wasmuth Portfolio'' in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs|first1=Charles E.|last1=Aguar|first2=Berdeana|last2=Aguar|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=2002|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces. The design also included all the amenities of a small city: schools, museums, markets, etc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=544}}</ref> This view of decentralization was later reinforced by theoretical [[Broadacre City]] design. The philosophy behind his community planning was decentralization. The new development must be away from the cities. In this decentralized America, all services and facilities could coexist \"factories side by side with farm and home.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=542}}</ref>\n\nNotable community planning designs:\n\n*1900\u201303 \u2013 Quadruple Block Plan, 24 homes in Oak Park, Illinois (unbuilt)\n*1909 \u2013 [[Como Orchard Summer Colony]], town site development for new town in the [[Bitterroot Valley]], Montana\n*1913 \u2013 Chicago Land Development competition, suburban Chicago quarter section\n*1934\u201359 \u2013 [[Broadacre City]], theoretical decentralized city plan, exhibits of large-scale model\n*1938 \u2013 [[Suntop Homes]], also known as Cloverleaf Quadruple Housing Project \u2013 commission from [[Federal Works Agency]], Division of Defense Housing, a low-cost multifamily housing alternative to suburban development\n*1942 \u2013 Cooperative Homesteads, commissioned by a group of auto workers, teachers and other professionals, 160-acre farm co-op was to be the pioneer of [[rammed earth]] and earth berm construction<ref>''Treasures of Taliesin: Seventy Seven Unbuilt Designs,'' Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archive</ref> (unbuilt)\n*1945 \u2013 [[Usonia Homes]], 47 homes (three designed by Wright) in [[Pleasantville, New York]]\n*1949 \u2013 [[The Acres]], also known as Galesburg Country Homes, five homes (four designed by Wright) in [[Charleston Township, Michigan]]\n*1949 \u2013 Parkwyn neighborhood, a [[plat]] in Kalamazoo, Michigan, developed by Wright containing mostly Usonian homes on circular lots with common spaces in between (since replatted)\n\n===Japanese art===\nThough most famous as an architect, Wright was an active dealer in Japanese art, primarily ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]].

New York: Abrams, 2000.</ref>\n\nWright first traveled to Japan in 1905, where he bought hundreds of prints. The following year, he helped organize the world's first retrospective exhibition of works by [[Hiroshige]], held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=cotter/> For many years, he was a major presence in the Japanese art world, selling a great number of works to prominent collectors such as John Spaulding of Boston,<ref name=cotter/> and to prominent museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.<ref name=reif/> He penned a book on Japanese art in 1912.<ref name=reif/>\n\nIn 1920, however, rival art dealers began to spread rumors that Wright was selling retouched prints; this, combined with Wright's tendency to live beyond his means, and other factors, led to great financial troubles for the architect. Though he provided his clients with genuine prints as replacements for those he was accused of retouching, this marked the end of the high point of his career as an art dealer.<ref name=reif/> He was forced to sell off much of his art collection in 1927 to pay off outstanding debts; the Bank of Wisconsin claimed his Taliesin home the following year, and sold thousands of his prints, for only one dollar a piece, to collector [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]].<ref name=cotter/>\n\nWright continued to collect and deal in prints until his death in 1959, using prints as collateral for loans, often relying upon his art business to remain financially solvent.<ref name=reif>{{cite news |last=Reif |first=Rita |title=Frank Lloyd Wright's Love of Japanese Prints Helped Pay the Bills |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 18, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/arts/art-architecture-the-master-builder-whose-other-love-helped-pay-the-bills.html }}</ref>\n\nThe extent of his dealings in Japanese art went largely unknown, or underestimated, among art historians for decades until, in 1980, Julia Meech, then associate curator of Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum, began researching the history of the museum's collection of Japanese prints. She discovered \"a three-inch-deep 'clump of 400 cards' from 1918, each listing a print bought from the same seller\u2014'F. L.

Although Olgivanna had taken no legal steps to move Wright's remains and against the wishes of other family members, as well as the Wisconsin legislature, in 1985, Wright's remains were removed from his grave by members of the Taliesin Fellowship, cremated, and sent to Scottsdale, where they were later interred in the memorial garden.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp.\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]].

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> As a founder of organic architecture, Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=777}}</ref> \n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as \"the greatest American architect of all time.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed [[World Heritage Site]] as ''[[The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright]].''\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]] and [[Louis Sullivan]].  He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893, and developed an influential home and studio in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] in 1898. His colorful personal life made headlines: leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin, and their children for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]], the murders by an employee at his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.\n\n==Early years==\n===Ancestry===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]]. Family records show that he was christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" (possibly in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) when born on June 8, 1867. Writer [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that the family name \"Lloyd\" was used shortly thereafter,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-fhnSK26vMC&pg=PT12&dq=frank+lincoln+wright&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCweLMnuPmAhVMZc0KHahfDfUQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=frank%20lincoln%20wright&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life|last=Huxtable|first=Ada Louise|date=2008-04-29|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4406-3173-3|language=en}}</ref> but biographer [[Meryle Secrest]] claims that Wright himself adopted \"Lloyd\" at 18, after his parents' divorce in 1884.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7ZB90XmTdcC&pg=PA79&dq=frank+lloyd+wright+name+change&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGhsftruPmAhVKXc0KHQdZD7QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20lloyd%20wright%20name%20change&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-74414-8|language=en}}</ref> \n\nWright's father, William Cary Wright (1825\u20131904), was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.<ref name=\":1\" />  He was also a published composer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimber|first=Marian Wilson|date=2014|title=Various Artists.

Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones clan who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}</ref> In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.\n\nIn 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top\u2026 and played\u2026 with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u2026 All are in my fingers to this day\u2026 \"<ref>Alofsin, Anthony (1993).

They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.\n\nSoon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. In 1884 William sued for a divorce from Anna on the grounds of \"\u2026 emotional cruelty and physical violence and spousal abandonment.\"<ref> Hendrickson, Paul, ''Plagued By Fire'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 2019, p. 399</ref> William left Wisconsin after the divorce was granted in 1885.

University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887\u20131888)===\nIn 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of Joseph Lyman Silsbee.<ref name=Wright /> Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee\u2014accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor\u2014on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.<ref name=FLWF /> While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.<ref name=OGorman /> Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.\n\nFeeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee\u2014this time with a raise in salary.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}</ref> Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more \"gracefully picturesque\" than the other \"brutalities\" of the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}</ref> Wright aspired for more progressive work.\n\n===Adler & Sullivan (1888\u20131893)===\n\nWright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Adler & Sullivan]] was \"looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}</ref> Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}</ref> Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his own employees, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89\u201394}}</ref> In spite of this, \"Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility.\" As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for \"Dear Master\").<ref name=Tafel /> He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller in the construction of several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.<ref name=Saint />\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]\n\nOn June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin (1871\u20131959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: \"Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?\"<ref name=\"Wright 2005, p. 97\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}</ref> With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.<ref name=Weil />\n\nBy 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.<ref name=Saint/><ref name=Gebhard /> Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler & Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.<ref name=Gebhard/> During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Lind />\n\n[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]\n\nDespite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These \"bootlegged\" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs with the residential projects for Adler & Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.<ref name=Lind/> Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He \"threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler & Sullivan office never to return.\" Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}</ref> However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.<ref name=Lind/><ref>{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}</ref> Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.\n\n===Transition and experimentation (1893\u20131900)===\nAfter leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler & Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}</ref> These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.<ref name=Brooks /> They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.<ref name=Cassidy /><ref name=MIT />\n\n[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]\n\nWright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56\u2013109}}</ref> While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]\n\nSoon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the \u00c9cole lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref name=Goldberger />\n\n[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]\n\nWright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio embodied Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which his next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Prairie style houses (1900\u20131914)===\nBy 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: <blockquote> \"[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!\"<ref>''My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright,'' by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arthur Heurtley House (1902), Oak Park, IL.JPG|thumb|[[Arthur Heurtley House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1902)]]\n[[File:Darwin D.

Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.<ref name=Clayton /> Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.<ref name=Sommer /><ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}</ref> At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" and \"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.<ref name=Clayton/> Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904. Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \"cornerstone of modernism\".\n\nWright's residential designs of this era were known as \"prairie houses\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials\u2014especially stone and wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, shifting his focus to a more democratic architecture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226776200 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}</ref> Wright went to Europe in 1909 with a portfolio of his work and presented it to Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth]].<ref>Secrest, p. 202</ref>  ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', published in 1911, was the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe.

Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space. [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]\n\nOther early notable public buildings included the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (1905) as well as the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).\n\n===Textile concrete block system===\nIn the early 1920s, Wright designed a \"[[Textile block house|textile]]\" concrete block system reinforced by an internal system of bars. The system of precast blocks, he wrote, enabled \"fabrication as infinite in color, texture, and variety as in that rug.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KiaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wright+critical+writings#v=onepage&q=wright%20critical%20writings&f=false|title=The Essential Frank Lloyd Wright: Critical Writings on Architecture|last=Wright|first=Frank Lloyd|date=2008|editor-last=Pfeiffer|editor-first=Bruce Brooks|website=Princeton University Press|language=en|access-date=May 7, 2019|isbn=9780691146324}}</ref> Wright first used his textile block system on the [[Millard House]] in Pasadena , California, in 1923.

As he explained in ''The Natural House'' (1954), \"The original blocks are made on the site by ramming concrete into wood or metal wrap-around forms, with one outside face (which may be pattered), and one rear or inside face, generally coffered, for lightness.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Midlife problems==\n\n===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===\n[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\nIn 1903, while Wright was designing a house for Edwin Cheney (a neighbor in Oak Park), he became enamored with Cheney's wife, Mamah. [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. Their relationship became the talk of the town; they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. In 1909, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright remained in Europe for almost a year, first in [[Florence, Italy]] (where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd) and, later, in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, \"''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''\" (\"The Truth Against the World\"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===\nOn August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" />\n\n===Divorce and further troubles===\nIn 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude \"Miriam\" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.\n\nOn April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.<ref>Secrest, p. 315\u2013317.</ref> Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home \"Taliesin III\".\n\nIn 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].<ref>Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, \"[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]\"</ref> The charges were later dropped.\n\nWright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927. Wright was again required to wait for one year before remarrying.

Twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed. \nConsiderable controversy existed over the living conditions and education of the fellows; recent books and articles have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment.<ref>Friedland, Roger, and Zellman, Harold.

He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including walls composed of a \"sandwich\" of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper\u2014a significant change from typically framed walls.<ref>Twombly, p.242</ref> Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.\n\nUsonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.<ref>Twombly, p.257</ref> As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.<ref>Twombly, p.244</ref> Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.\n\n===Significant later works===\n[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]\n\n[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''[[Fallingwater]]'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.\n\n[[Taliesin West]], Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.\nWright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&nbsp;years (1943\u20131959)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.\n\n[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]\nThe only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] \u2014 ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The \"as-built\" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|accessdate=May 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project.

He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for \"Prism Glass Tiles\" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.<ref>http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/</ref> Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.<ref name=\"TMCnet\">{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright. \"In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials\u2014Glass\". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.</ref> One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}</ref>\n\nWright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]\nWright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization \"a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,\" and \"a form of refined gangsterism.\" When an associate referred to him as \"an old amateur\" Wright confirmed, \"I am the oldest.\"<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:\n# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)\n# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life\n# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])\n# Japanese art, prints and buildings\n# [[Froebel Gifts]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=March 1, 1989|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24\u201337|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808|jstor=990404}}</ref>\n\nHe also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.<ref>Griffin, Marion Mahony, ''The Magic of America'', typescript, 1947</ref> As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].\n\nThe Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.\n\nLater, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], [[William Bernoudy]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\n===Community planning===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.<ref>''Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs'', Charles E. and Berdeana Aguar, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p.344</ref>\n\nHis thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E. Roberts]] entitled the \"Quadruple Block Plan.\" This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. The houses, which used the same design as published in \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" from the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the ''Wasmuth Portfolio'' in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs|first1=Charles E.|last1=Aguar|first2=Berdeana|last2=Aguar|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=2002|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces. The design also included all the amenities of a small city: schools, museums, markets, etc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=544}}</ref> This view of decentralization was later reinforced by theoretical [[Broadacre City]] design. The philosophy behind his community planning was decentralization. The new development must be away from the cities. In this decentralized America, all services and facilities could coexist \"factories side by side with farm and home.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=542}}</ref>\n\nNotable community planning designs:\n\n*1900\u201303 \u2013 Quadruple Block Plan, 24 homes in Oak Park, Illinois (unbuilt)\n*1909 \u2013 [[Como Orchard Summer Colony]], town site development for new town in the [[Bitterroot Valley]], Montana\n*1913 \u2013 Chicago Land Development competition, suburban Chicago quarter section\n*1934\u201359 \u2013 [[Broadacre City]], theoretical decentralized city plan, exhibits of large-scale model\n*1938 \u2013 [[Suntop Homes]], also known as Cloverleaf Quadruple Housing Project \u2013 commission from [[Federal Works Agency]], Division of Defense Housing, a low-cost multifamily housing alternative to suburban development\n*1942 \u2013 Cooperative Homesteads, commissioned by a group of auto workers, teachers and other professionals, 160-acre farm co-op was to be the pioneer of [[rammed earth]] and earth berm construction<ref>''Treasures of Taliesin: Seventy Seven Unbuilt Designs,'' Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archive</ref> (unbuilt)\n*1945 \u2013 [[Usonia Homes]], 47 homes (three designed by Wright) in [[Pleasantville, New York]]\n*1949 \u2013 [[The Acres]], also known as Galesburg Country Homes, five homes (four designed by Wright) in [[Charleston Township, Michigan]]\n*1949 \u2013 Parkwyn neighborhood, a [[plat]] in Kalamazoo, Michigan, developed by Wright containing mostly Usonian homes on circular lots with common spaces in between (since replatted)\n\n===Japanese art===\nThough most famous as an architect, Wright was an active dealer in Japanese art, primarily ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]].

New York: Abrams, 2000.</ref>\n\nWright first traveled to Japan in 1905, where he bought hundreds of prints. The following year, he helped organize the world's first retrospective exhibition of works by [[Hiroshige]], held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=cotter/> For many years, he was a major presence in the Japanese art world, selling a great number of works to prominent collectors such as John Spaulding of Boston,<ref name=cotter/> and to prominent museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.<ref name=reif/> He penned a book on Japanese art in 1912.<ref name=reif/>\n\nIn 1920, however, rival art dealers began to spread rumors that Wright was selling retouched prints; this, combined with Wright's tendency to live beyond his means, and other factors, led to great financial troubles for the architect. Though he provided his clients with genuine prints as replacements for those he was accused of retouching, this marked the end of the high point of his career as an art dealer.<ref name=reif/> He was forced to sell off much of his art collection in 1927 to pay off outstanding debts; the Bank of Wisconsin claimed his Taliesin home the following year, and sold thousands of his prints, for only one dollar a piece, to collector [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]].<ref name=cotter/>\n\nWright continued to collect and deal in prints until his death in 1959, using prints as collateral for loans, often relying upon his art business to remain financially solvent.<ref name=reif>{{cite news |last=Reif |first=Rita |title=Frank Lloyd Wright's Love of Japanese Prints Helped Pay the Bills |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 18, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/arts/art-architecture-the-master-builder-whose-other-love-helped-pay-the-bills.html }}</ref>\n\nThe extent of his dealings in Japanese art went largely unknown, or underestimated, among art historians for decades until, in 1980, Julia Meech, then associate curator of Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum, began researching the history of the museum's collection of Japanese prints. She discovered \"a three-inch-deep 'clump of 400 cards' from 1918, each listing a print bought from the same seller\u2014'F. L. Wright'\" and a number of letters exchanged between Wright and the museum's first curator of Far Eastern Art, Sigisbert C.

Although Olgivanna had taken no legal steps to move Wright's remains and against the wishes of other family members, as well as the Wisconsin legislature, in 1985, Wright's remains were removed from his grave by members of the Taliesin Fellowship, cremated, and sent to Scottsdale, where they were later interred in the memorial garden.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp.\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]].
