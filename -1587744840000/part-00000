Around this time human beings had lost the ability to procreate while simultaneously a pandemic known as the Half-Dead Fever gripped the world, causing twenty thousand deaths and reanimating their corpses. Since there was no sure way to grant rest to an undead person, the gravekeepers started appearing and were able to put the dead to rest using special burial rituals only they can perform. Ai Astin is one such gravekeeper, and when she meets a mysterious stranger calling himself Hampnie Hambart, she slowly starts to learn the true nature of their world.\n\nThe anime is produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and directed by Yuuji Kumazawa, with series composition by Tomoko Konparu, character designs by Shinichi Miyamae based on the original designs by Shino, art direction by Junko Shimizu and sound direction by Satoshi Motoyama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kami-nai.com/staff_cast/|title=TV\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300e\u795e\u3055\u307e\u306e\u3044\u306a\u3044\u65e5\u66dc\u65e5\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\uff5c\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 / Staff & cast|publisher=[[King Records (Japan)|King Records]]|language=Japanese |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref> The series premiered on [[Tokyo MX]] on July 6, 2013 with later airings on [[Chiba Television Broadcasting|CTC]], [[Television Kanagawa|tvk]], [[TV Saitama]], [[Sun Television|Sun TV]], [[Kyoto Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]], [[TV Aichi]] and [[BS11 (television)|BS11]].<ref name=\"On air\"/> The twelve episode series was followed by an [[original video animation|OVA]] episode on February 5, 2014.

Unwilling to listen to the man's reasoning, Ai furiously attacks him, but he easily overpowers her. A flashback shows the 7-year-old Ai, being made the village gravekeeper upon her mother's death and had been carrying out her duty ever since, explaining that grave-keepers are the only ones that can help the dead rest in peace after God's Abandonment. While staying with her foster parents, Y\u014dki and Anna the latter can't help but lament that Ai is unhappy with her life; although Ai believes that her father, Hampnie Hambart will visit one day. The next day, Ai grows concerned when she doesn't notice the townsfolk. She bumps into a white haired man who surprisingly learns that she is the village gravekeeper before he inquires about the whereabouts of a woman named Hana, to no avail. Introducing himself as Hampnie Hambart, Ai claims that he is her father much to his objection. Afterwards, Hampnie asks Ai for her gravekeeping services. While passing through the village, Ai terrifyingly notices all of the dead villagers before being approached by the wounded farmer, Y\u016bto. Still walking despite a fatal gunshot to the head, Y\u016bto defends Ai while drawing a gun on Hampnie. Hampnie easily kills Y\u016bto with another head-shot, explaining that destroying the brain is the only way to be sure. Ai then charges at Hampnie in a fit of rage. She eventually wakes up and admits that Hampnie isn't her father, due to his cruelty before he tasks her with burying her entire village. Afterwards, Ai follows Hampnie out of town where he shatters her reality by revealing that she isn't a true gravekeeper since she possesses both parents and emotions, before introducing her to a true gravekeeper.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Valley of Death II\n| TranslitTitle       = Shi no Tani II\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b7b\u306e\u8c37II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|13}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Hampnie introduces Ai to Scar, a true gravekeeper and questions her on the whereabouts of Hana, but upon yielding no results, tasks her with burying the villagers. Scar reveals that Ai is indeed a gravekeeper since she already took care of the burials much to Hampnie's surprise. Afterwards, Hampnie mercilessly questions Ai on what she intends to do now that she has nowhere to go. Suddenly, Hampnie is shot by Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich, his childhood friend who claims of wanting revenge for Hampnie \"killing\" his [[undead]] wife. Revealing his immortality, Hampnie deduces Julie's cowardice of wanting to die for \"revenge\" rather than [[Suicide|by his own hand]] due to the pain of losing his family. Unwilling to listen, Julie threatens Ai and demands a [[duel#Pistols|duel]] from Hampnie, who seems to accept. Ai resolves to remain being a gravekeeper and leaves the village with Hampnie who disregards the duel with Julie. That night, Hampnie realizes that twelve-year-old Ai is an anomalous human/gravekeeper hybrid, since humans were denied [[procreation]] after God's Abandonment fifteen years ago. He explains his belief that God had grown weary of his duty and resorted to granting desires, the first being humanity's wish for eternal life followed by his own of true [[immortality]] to overcome his weak body. Sometime after the Half-Dead Fever Pandemic gripped the world whereby the dead started walking, and the mysteriously appearing gravekeepers were the only ones who could help the undead find peace. Hampnie adds that if a person dies a clean death, they barely change but over time they regress into a horrific monstrous state which is why he put down Julie's wife. Finally, Ai asks Hampnie why he killed the townsfolk and he reveals that she would eventually find out, along with the secret hidden within her village.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Valley of Death III\n| TranslitTitle       = Shi no Tani III\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b7b\u306e\u8c37III\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|20}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = A flashback shows Lady Alfa and her daughter Ai overlooking their village, with the former expressing a desire of changing their village into a place equivalent to [[Heaven]] where the dead can be happy. As their travels continue, Ai learns that Hana had seemingly abandoned Hampnie ten years previously and in addition that Hampnie is searching for a way to end his life, since the thought of being the last living human terrifies him. Just as Ai deduces that he merely acts cruel to hide his pain, they are discovered and Hampnie kicks Ai off the bridge into the river below. Ai awakens to find herself on the bank with Julie who reveals Hampnie had saved her from an ambush but was hence kidnapped. Julie also notes that Hampnie does not like meaningless violence and has his own sense of morality, and he shows Ai a picture of Hampnie's lover, Hana, who Ai shockingly acknowledges as her mother. Julie then calls Hampnie an undying monster, and Ai yells at him, saying that she wants to find Hampnie and to stop him from becoming even more twisted.  Julie decides to help Ai rescue Hampnie and then they are approached by Scar. Elsewhere, Hampnie reawakens to find himself held captive by a band of undead psychopaths. Their leader, a man called Hiko starts taunting Hampnie, who reveals that his true wish is to live a happy life and then contently die with few regrets while surrounded by those who care for him. Just then, Scar and Ai come to Hampnie's rescue much to his objection. Ai walks into the room and reveals a shocking revelation to Hampnie that she is in fact the daughter of Hana and also of realizing that everyone in her village had died long ago but they had pretended to be alive for her sake. Finally, with backup from Julie, Ai and Scar incapacitate the undead psychopaths. After accepting this revelation, Hampnie and Ai have a tearful father-daughter reunion, with the former revealing his true name: Kizuna Astin and as his wish is finally fulfilled, Kizuna dies the death he always wanted.\n\nIn the epilogue, Kizuna reawakens as an undead much to Ai's joy, and along with Julie and Scar, make their way back to Ai's [[Psalm 23|village in the valley]] while spending as much time with each other as they can. Finally, at the village's graveyard, Ai buries her father, Kizuna next to her mother, Hana and mourns their passing. With the burial over, Ai states to Julie and Scar that if God abandoned their world, she will become a true gravekeeper and save it.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Ortus I\n| TranslitTitle       = Orutasu I\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9I\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|27}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ai, Julie and Scar set out on their journey in a repaired [[minibus]] and notice a young man sleeping in the backseat who briefly wakes up and then passes out. As they continue on, Julie warns Ai to hide the fact that she is a gravekeeper from the world just as the young man, Kiriko Zubreska reawakens and explains that he is an Ortus governmental apprentice who had fled from thieves. With the bus still in need of repairs, Kiriko and Julie explain to Ai that Ortus is a city of the dead, consisting of almost one million undead inhabitants and due to its high population density, is equivalent to a small country. As Julie warns against Ai's desire to see the city, he explains that Ortus' inhabitants slaughter any gravekeepers who are drawn to the city, just as they pass a mass graveyard in the city outskirts littered with the graves of numerous gravekeepers. As they approach the entrance gates, a particular statue catches Ai's attention; Ortus' Guardian Goddess: Koroshiohake who Kiriko, explains wields the power of [[Death (personification)|Death]]. Afterwards, Kiriko allows Ai and co. to stay in specially designated quarters for living humans within the city before they are met by city officials; the two-faced Pox and Wreck who thank the group for bringing Kiriko back and much to Julie's reluctance, allow them to enter the city. As they enter, Kiriko kindly asks that they leave once their minibus is repaired. The next morning, Julie prohibits Ai from setting foot outside their inn while simultaneously, Scar falls ill, and explains of hearing a voice calling out to her. That evening, Ai excitedly goes to explore the city using a mask she obtained from their inn's manager, and encounters a mysterious man wearing a lion mask who warns her to leave Ortus before its dark nature reveals itself. Elsewhere, Kiriko meets with Ortus' Princess Ulla Eulesse Hecmatika, and remarks that she will be the one to save the world.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Ortus II\n| TranslitTitle       = Orutasu II\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|8|3}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = After her brief encounter with the man in the lion mask, Ai meets up with Kiriko who insists on escorting her back to the inn. Having grown trusting of Kiriko, Ai reveals her anomalous nature as a gravekeeper and laments that her former village may have turned out a lot brighter if the townsfolk had adopted the ways of Ortus. Kiriko in turn reveals his true nature as an undead and tells Ai the story of his origin, whereby he was created by a witch using the living pieces of five friends who desperately wanted a child following God's Abandonment. Ai correctly deduces that Pox and Wreck are two of the five, with the others being Diva, Orius and Velera, who collectively are known as the \"Fallen Five-Pointed Star\". Upon returning to the inn, Kiriko enlists the help of Diva to have a look at the ill Scar. Diva's analysis reveals that Scar has a condition known as [[pseudocyesis]] and suspects that the voices Scar had been hearing are somehow connected. The following day, at Diva's request, Kiriko takes Ai to meet Princess Ulla and much to his surprise, finds that they both quickly develop a friendship. At the same time, a large mass of cloaked people approach Ortus. That evening, Julie and Ai discuss the disparity between the living and undead within Ortus. Just then, they are interrupted by the sound of the city's bells. Kiriko bursts into the room to inform them of the beginning of a ceremony to kill the group of one hundred and five humans who had approached the city and accept them into Ortus after having lost their will to live. This causes Ai to lament the contradiction this situation puts on her duty as a gravekeeper. While also thinking that Ulla is alive and the ceremony is being performed behind her back, Ai ignores Julie's questions and rushes to the citadel; unbeknownst to her, Ulla herself is the one performing the ceremony.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Ortus III - The Mystery of a Lifetime\n| TranslitTitle       = Orutasu III\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9III\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|8|10}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ai arrives at the citadel and much to her horror witnesses Kiriko removing the covers blocking Ulla's [[sense]] of sight at which point her gaze extracts the life from the people, who are hence reborn as undead. Just as Ulla turns her gaze upon Ai, Julie rescues her at the last second, and are joined by the man in the lion mask. The man explains that Ulla ''is'' Koroshiohake, with her power of death being Ortus's dark nature. Ai refuses to believe that Ulla knows the true nature of her power, believing that Ulla had been deceived just as she was, at which point Kiriko appears and confirms this whilst accepting responsibility for the deception. Kiriko further explains his desire to protect Ulla from the harsh reality of their world ever since being appointed as her teacher by Ortus's elders and that he wants the deception to last until Ulla remains as the last living human, thus making her powers meaningless. Ai counters by remembering Kizuna's ''fear'', but Kiriko remains adamant in his decision due to his love for Ulla and instead questions whether Ai would have had the same resolve. That same night, Ai visits Ulla in the castle and reveals the truth about Ortus and both of their powers, which is confirmed by a saddened Kiriko. Ulla explains to them of suspecting something had always been kept hidden from her, but chooses to contently accept everything; her ability, Kiriko's painful task, Ortus's nature and herself, only lamenting of being unable to truly interact with Ai as friends should, but embraces her nonetheless through Kiriko. Afterwards, Ulla takes Ai, Julie and Scar to visit her older sister Celica Hecmatika; a baby [[Suspended animation|frozen in time]]. Kiriko explains that Ulla's mother hatefully wished death upon all humans at her deathbed, granting the unborn Ulla her power; which was rejected by her twin, Celica. Finally much to everyone's shock, Scar realizes Celica had been calling out to her, and upon Scar's touch, the child enters the flow of time.\n\nIn the epilogue, Ulla reveals that she had known Celica was simply waiting for the right person at which point Scar adopts Celica as her daughter with Ulla's blessing. The next day, a mysterious youth with a ghostly companion observes Ai and co. as they leave Ortus and remarks that he and Ai are one and the same.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = Goran Academy I\n| TranslitTitle       = G\u014dra Gakuen I\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b4\u30fc\u30e9\u5b66\u5712I\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|8|17}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = In a clock tower, the mysterious boy Alice Color introduces himself to Ai.

Ai is taken to an unusual school, Goran Academy, where the students have special abilities. Due to her na\u00efve personality, Ai initially sees nothing odd about the school, and the other students explain the true nature of Goran Academy. In the girls' bath, Ai reveals her human/gravekeeper heritage, while the others display their abilities too. In particular, Tanya Swedgewood tells her ability is 'Spirit Vision', which allows her to sense the shape of sounds and colors, since she is blind. She senses Ai's aura is like a rainbow at night. Alice and two other boys accidentally break into the bath, angering the girls. Alice then explains that they are digging an escape route through the sewerage.

Nevertheless, Ai encourages Gigi Totogi, and the Gedenburg sisters, Mimieta and Memepo, to leave as a way to start a new life if they want, but Tanya is still unsure, and she envies Ai's [[Aura (paranormal)|willpower]].

Alice and Dee travel with Ai, Julie, and Celica. Driving through wastelands, Julie relates Scar's identity crisis, since gravekeepers are naturally emotionless individuals. Soon Dee realizes that the day before was Alice's birthday, much to Ai's dismay. Ignoring Alice's protests, Ai convinces him that it's important to celebrate one's birthday, and ask Julie to bake a cake. At night, Alice apologizes and thanks Ai for her kindness. Later, after arriving in a foggy ominous land known as the Story Circle - the birthplace of gravekeepers - they encounter numerous identical gravekeepers being \"born\" and passing by. Julie explains that identical gravekeepers are categorized as \"families\" (such as the Bezel and Beeny families), and he also notes that some gravekeepers are unique, like Ai's mother. As Dee decides to depart, Ai, Julie (carrying Celica), and Alice walk through the fog when they unknowingly got separated. They all began to see [[illusion]]s within the fog of their lives' most significant memories: Julie sees his deceased wife and daughter, Alice notices a strange open window of his past, and Ai sees her parents Kizuna and Hana. Confused and depressed, Ai begins to lose hope until she spontaneously remembers what Kizuna and Hana taught her were the essentials in life. Finally they find Scar, and Julie reassures her how Celica is important to her, no matter if she a gravekeeper, and he promises to protect her, while Ai and Alice think he is proposing to her.\n\nIn the epilogue, Ai joins with Alice's quest to save his world, even though he believes it to be a small community, and they head for a town called Ostia.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = Class 3-4 I\n| TranslitTitle       = San-nen Yon-kumi I\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e09\u5e74\u56db\u7d44I\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|9|7}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = A flashback shows the city of Ostia with an enormous Ferris wheel, and before killing his classmates, Alice explains that they are in a [[closed space]] where the world resets itself to default values as if destruction and change never happened. In the outside world, arriving at a desolated Ostia, Alice leads Ai, Julie, Scar, and Celica to the sealed Class 3-4, accessed through a school building. He explained they will not be able to leave until the seal over the city is broken, but Ai still chooses to help, and Julie and Scar state they will follow her wherever she goes.  They are welcomed by the people of Ostia in an out-of-sync winter, and walking towards Alice's home they are greeted by Dee, who now has a physical form. Settling at their new home, they notice that the world is fourteen years ago in the past and question Alice, but he is reluctant to answer just yet. Another flashback shows the first time Alice and Dee left Ostia, and Dee is shocked to find herself as ghost. Later, Ai transfers into Class 3-4 and meet the classmates of Alice and Dee.  Dee asks Ai if she has interest in any school activates, saying she may come to like staying in Ostia. Ai begins to realize that the world of Class 3-4 was created by a wish, which Alice confirms. That night, Alice finally explains Ostia is trapped in a [[Temporal Loop|temporal loop]] that resets every July 28th, and thus far Alice has brought a total of 35,695 living people into Ostia in order to shake up the world. He also reveals that Dee is probably preventing him from solving the temporal loop for unknown reason. The final scene is a flashback of Dee falling out a window.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Class 3-4 II\n| TranslitTitle       = San-nen Yon-kumi II\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e09\u5e74\u56db\u7d44II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|9|14}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ai begins her investigation of Class 3-4. Alice confirms he occasionally brings clues that he found in the outside world, but Dee secretly keeps destroying them. When it is time for Ai's thirteenth birthday, Julie, Scar, and the students of Class 3-4 throw a party for her. Alice's gift to Ai is her repaired gravekeeper's shovel. He reminds her that she mustn't forget her duties as a gravekeeper, and remarks that people's wishes shouldn't always be granted, as it won't help them move forward. Alice mentions that Dee has changed as if she is hiding something, and she believes Class 3-4 is a better place than the outside world. As the months go by and Ai continues her investigation, she volunteers with Alice for the school's [[Cultural festival (Japan)|cultural festival]] which causes a slight time paradox. In the library, Ai is trying to find clues that Alice has left behind, but Dee usually finds them first and destroys them. Luckily, Ai manages to find a clue that Dee failed to notice. Reading an article concerning about a student from Class 3-4 who had died, but Dee catches her before she sees the name. Dee reveals that she died on July 28th and that Class 3-4 wished to reset time to prevent her death after she fell out a window, thus creating the temporal loop. Dee fears if that world were to disappear she will as well, explaining why she prevents anyone from resolving the temporal loop. Ai realizes that Dee is in love with Alice, and Dee asks her not to tell him. Dee feels that she is the only one who can truly understand Alice; however, when she witnesses Alice and Ai playing basketball together, she begins to feel envious and dejected.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Class 3-4 III\n| TranslitTitle       = San-nen Yon-kumi III\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e09\u5e74\u56db\u7d44III\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|9|21}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ai and Alice play basketball together, and when Dee overhears Alice's conviction to sacrifice anything he must to free Class 3-4, she decides she will create her own world by first destroying the old.  In the morning, Ai hears from Dee that she is going to tell Alice the cause of everything, and asks her to go with her afterwards. At the basketball court, Ai meets up with Alice and wonders what will happen next. Dee then arrives in the classroom when she kills a male student, and the rest of the students are shocked when they see him revive. Ai and Alice then notice that Dee is forcing all the students of Class 3-4 to remember the incident of ''that'' day, and the world begins to reset itself drastically. They run for the classroom while Dee attempts to repeat that same day by jumping out of the window again as means to reset the world and herself. Meanwhile, Julie and Scar witness a fog-wave that threatens to swallow Ostia. Dee begins to fall, but just then an epiphany suddenly strikes her - it was actually Alice who died that day. Alice grabs her, then Ai and all of Class 3-4 pull them to safety in time. As the fog-wave retreats, Alice realizes the truth and remembers how he died while saving Dee from falling. He convinces Dee and the other students of Class 3-4 to depart for the outside world and experience real life, thanking them for caring about him so much.  While the world is vanishing deliberately at last, Alice reveals he was buried by a gravekeeper in the outside world, and he implores a crying Ai to go as God's observer.\n\nIn the epilogue, Julie, Scar, Celica, Dee, and all the citizens have evacuated to the outside world. Ai is seen in front of Alice's grave, and he appears next to her, asking why she had to save him (by having wished for his continued existence in the outside world), and she smiles.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13 OVA\n| Title               = Memories\n| TranslitTitle       = Kioku\n| NativeTitle         = \u8a18\u61b6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2014|2|5}}\n| Aux4                = \n| ShortSummary        = This bonus episode is separated into three parts.

While staying with her foster parents, Y\u014dki and Anna the latter can't help but lament that Ai is unhappy with her life; although Ai believes that her father, Hampnie Hambart will visit one day. The next day, Ai grows concerned when she doesn't notice the townsfolk. She bumps into a white haired man who surprisingly learns that she is the village gravekeeper before he inquires about the whereabouts of a woman named Hana, to no avail. Introducing himself as Hampnie Hambart, Ai claims that he is her father much to his objection. Afterwards, Hampnie asks Ai for her gravekeeping services. While passing through the village, Ai terrifyingly notices all of the dead villagers before being approached by the wounded farmer, Y\u016bto. Still walking despite a fatal gunshot to the head, Y\u016bto defends Ai while drawing a gun on Hampnie. Hampnie easily kills Y\u016bto with another head-shot, explaining that destroying the brain is the only way to be sure. Ai then charges at Hampnie in a fit of rage. She eventually wakes up and admits that Hampnie isn't her father, due to his cruelty before he tasks her with burying her entire village. Afterwards, Ai follows Hampnie out of town where he shatters her reality by revealing that she isn't a true gravekeeper since she possesses both parents and emotions, before introducing her to a true gravekeeper.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Valley of Death II\n| TranslitTitle       = Shi no Tani II\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b7b\u306e\u8c37II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|13}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Hampnie introduces Ai to Scar, a true gravekeeper and questions her on the whereabouts of Hana, but upon yielding no results, tasks her with burying the villagers. Scar reveals that Ai is indeed a gravekeeper since she already took care of the burials much to Hampnie's surprise. Afterwards, Hampnie mercilessly questions Ai on what she intends to do now that she has nowhere to go. Suddenly, Hampnie is shot by Julie Sakuma Dmitriyevich, his childhood friend who claims of wanting revenge for Hampnie \"killing\" his [[undead]] wife. Revealing his immortality, Hampnie deduces Julie's cowardice of wanting to die for \"revenge\" rather than [[Suicide|by his own hand]] due to the pain of losing his family. Unwilling to listen, Julie threatens Ai and demands a [[duel#Pistols|duel]] from Hampnie, who seems to accept. Ai resolves to remain being a gravekeeper and leaves the village with Hampnie who disregards the duel with Julie. That night, Hampnie realizes that twelve-year-old Ai is an anomalous human/gravekeeper hybrid, since humans were denied [[procreation]] after God's Abandonment fifteen years ago. He explains his belief that God had grown weary of his duty and resorted to granting desires, the first being humanity's wish for eternal life followed by his own of true [[immortality]] to overcome his weak body. Sometime after the Half-Dead Fever Pandemic gripped the world whereby the dead started walking, and the mysteriously appearing gravekeepers were the only ones who could help the undead find peace. Hampnie adds that if a person dies a clean death, they barely change but over time they regress into a horrific monstrous state which is why he put down Julie's wife. Finally, Ai asks Hampnie why he killed the townsfolk and he reveals that she would eventually find out, along with the secret hidden within her village.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Valley of Death III\n| TranslitTitle       = Shi no Tani III\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b7b\u306e\u8c37III\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|20}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = A flashback shows Lady Alfa and her daughter Ai overlooking their village, with the former expressing a desire of changing their village into a place equivalent to [[Heaven]] where the dead can be happy. As their travels continue, Ai learns that Hana had seemingly abandoned Hampnie ten years previously and in addition that Hampnie is searching for a way to end his life, since the thought of being the last living human terrifies him. Just as Ai deduces that he merely acts cruel to hide his pain, they are discovered and Hampnie kicks Ai off the bridge into the river below. Ai awakens to find herself on the bank with Julie who reveals Hampnie had saved her from an ambush but was hence kidnapped. Julie also notes that Hampnie does not like meaningless violence and has his own sense of morality, and he shows Ai a picture of Hampnie's lover, Hana, who Ai shockingly acknowledges as her mother. Julie then calls Hampnie an undying monster, and Ai yells at him, saying that she wants to find Hampnie and to stop him from becoming even more twisted.  Julie decides to help Ai rescue Hampnie and then they are approached by Scar. Elsewhere, Hampnie reawakens to find himself held captive by a band of undead psychopaths. Their leader, a man called Hiko starts taunting Hampnie, who reveals that his true wish is to live a happy life and then contently die with few regrets while surrounded by those who care for him. Just then, Scar and Ai come to Hampnie's rescue much to his objection. Ai walks into the room and reveals a shocking revelation to Hampnie that she is in fact the daughter of Hana and also of realizing that everyone in her village had died long ago but they had pretended to be alive for her sake. Finally, with backup from Julie, Ai and Scar incapacitate the undead psychopaths. After accepting this revelation, Hampnie and Ai have a tearful father-daughter reunion, with the former revealing his true name: Kizuna Astin and as his wish is finally fulfilled, Kizuna dies the death he always wanted.\n\nIn the epilogue, Kizuna reawakens as an undead much to Ai's joy, and along with Julie and Scar, make their way back to Ai's [[Psalm 23|village in the valley]] while spending as much time with each other as they can. Finally, at the village's graveyard, Ai buries her father, Kizuna next to her mother, Hana and mourns their passing. With the burial over, Ai states to Julie and Scar that if God abandoned their world, she will become a true gravekeeper and save it.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Ortus I\n| TranslitTitle       = Orutasu I\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9I\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|7|27}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ai, Julie and Scar set out on their journey in a repaired [[minibus]] and notice a young man sleeping in the backseat who briefly wakes up and then passes out. As they continue on, Julie warns Ai to hide the fact that she is a gravekeeper from the world just as the young man, Kiriko Zubreska reawakens and explains that he is an Ortus governmental apprentice who had fled from thieves. With the bus still in need of repairs, Kiriko and Julie explain to Ai that Ortus is a city of the dead, consisting of almost one million undead inhabitants and due to its high population density, is equivalent to a small country. As Julie warns against Ai's desire to see the city, he explains that Ortus' inhabitants slaughter any gravekeepers who are drawn to the city, just as they pass a mass graveyard in the city outskirts littered with the graves of numerous gravekeepers. As they approach the entrance gates, a particular statue catches Ai's attention; Ortus' Guardian Goddess: Koroshiohake who Kiriko, explains wields the power of [[Death (personification)|Death]]. Afterwards, Kiriko allows Ai and co. to stay in specially designated quarters for living humans within the city before they are met by city officials; the two-faced Pox and Wreck who thank the group for bringing Kiriko back and much to Julie's reluctance, allow them to enter the city. As they enter, Kiriko kindly asks that they leave once their minibus is repaired. The next morning, Julie prohibits Ai from setting foot outside their inn while simultaneously, Scar falls ill, and explains of hearing a voice calling out to her. That evening, Ai excitedly goes to explore the city using a mask she obtained from their inn's manager, and encounters a mysterious man wearing a lion mask who warns her to leave Ortus before its dark nature reveals itself. Elsewhere, Kiriko meets with Ortus' Princess Ulla Eulesse Hecmatika, and remarks that she will be the one to save the world.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Ortus II\n| TranslitTitle       = Orutasu II\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9II\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|8|3}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = After her brief encounter with the man in the lion mask, Ai meets up with Kiriko who insists on escorting her back to the inn. Having grown trusting of Kiriko, Ai reveals her anomalous nature as a gravekeeper and laments that her former village may have turned out a lot brighter if the townsfolk had adopted the ways of Ortus. Kiriko in turn reveals his true nature as an undead and tells Ai the story of his origin, whereby he was created by a witch using the living pieces of five friends who desperately wanted a child following God's Abandonment. Ai correctly deduces that Pox and Wreck are two of the five, with the others being Diva, Orius and Velera, who collectively are known as the \"Fallen Five-Pointed Star\". Upon returning to the inn, Kiriko enlists the help of Diva to have a look at the ill Scar. Diva's analysis reveals that Scar has a condition known as [[pseudocyesis]] and suspects that the voices Scar had been hearing are somehow connected. The following day, at Diva's request, Kiriko takes Ai to meet Princess Ulla and much to his surprise, finds that they both quickly develop a friendship. At the same time, a large mass of cloaked people approach Ortus. That evening, Julie and Ai discuss the disparity between the living and undead within Ortus. Just then, they are interrupted by the sound of the city's bells. Kiriko bursts into the room to inform them of the beginning of a ceremony to kill the group of one hundred and five humans who had approached the city and accept them into Ortus after having lost their will to live. This causes Ai to lament the contradiction this situation puts on her duty as a gravekeeper. While also thinking that Ulla is alive and the ceremony is being performed behind her back, Ai ignores Julie's questions and rushes to the citadel; unbeknownst to her, Ulla herself is the one performing the ceremony.\n| LineColor           = FFA07A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Ortus III - The Mystery of a Lifetime\n| TranslitTitle       = Orutasu III\n| NativeTitle         = \u30aa\u30eb\u30bf\u30b9III\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|8|10}}\n| Aux4                = <ref name=\"Story\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ai arrives at the citadel and much to her horror witnesses Kiriko removing the covers blocking Ulla's [[sense]] of sight at which point her gaze extracts the life from the people, who are hence reborn as undead. Just as Ulla turns her gaze upon Ai, Julie rescues her at the last second, and are joined by the man in the lion mask. The man explains that Ulla ''is'' Koroshiohake, with her power of death being Ortus's dark nature. Ai refuses to believe that Ulla knows the true nature of her power, believing that Ulla had been deceived just as she was, at which point Kiriko appears and confirms this whilst accepting responsibility for the deception. Kiriko further explains his desire to protect Ulla from the harsh reality of their world ever since being appointed as her teacher by Ortus's elders and that he wants the deception to last until Ulla remains as the last living human, thus making her powers meaningless. Ai counters by remembering Kizuna's ''fear'', but Kiriko remains adamant in his decision due to his love for Ulla and instead questions whether Ai would have had the same resolve. That same night, Ai visits Ulla in the castle and reveals the truth about Ortus and both of their powers, which is confirmed by a saddened Kiriko. Ulla explains to them of suspecting something had always been kept hidden from her, but chooses to contently accept everything; her ability, Kiriko's painful task, Ortus's nature and herself, only lamenting of being unable to truly interact with Ai as friends should, but embraces her nonetheless through Kiriko. Afterwards, Ulla takes Ai, Julie and Scar to visit her older sister Celica Hecmatika; a baby [[Suspended animation|frozen in time]]. Kiriko explains that Ulla's mother hatefully wished death upon all humans at her deathbed, granting the unborn Ulla her power; which was rejected by her twin, Celica. Finally much to everyone's shock, Scar realizes Celica had been calling out to her, and upon Scar's touch, the child enters the flow of time.\n\nIn the epilogue, Ulla reveals that she had known Celica was simply waiting for the right person at which point Scar adopts Celica as her daughter with Ulla's blessing.

In particular, Tanya Swedgewood tells her ability is 'Spirit Vision', which allows her to sense the shape of sounds and colors, since she is blind. She senses Ai's aura is like a rainbow at night. Alice and two other boys accidentally break into the bath, angering the girls. Alice then explains that they are digging an escape route through the sewerage.

Soon Dee realizes that the day before was Alice's birthday, much to Ai's dismay. Ignoring Alice's protests, Ai convinces him that it's important to celebrate one's birthday, and ask Julie to bake a cake. At night, Alice apologizes and thanks Ai for her kindness. Later, after arriving in a foggy ominous land known as the Story Circle - the birthplace of gravekeepers - they encounter numerous identical gravekeepers being \"born\" and passing by. Julie explains that identical gravekeepers are categorized as \"families\" (such as the Bezel and Beeny families), and he also notes that some gravekeepers are unique, like Ai's mother. As Dee decides to depart, Ai, Julie (carrying Celica), and Alice walk through the fog when they unknowingly got separated.

Usagi liberates the power she amassed to deal a fatal blow on the already fatally damaged Master Pharaoh 90. Seeing no need to wipe out Earth as Usagi is still alive, Saturn instead intercepts Pharaoh 90 during his attempted escape back into the Tau Star System and has Sailor Pluto use her Dark Dome Close to seal them both away. When the Legendary Silver Crystal evolves all the other Sailor Guardians to their Super forms, Usagi briefly transforms into Neo Queen Serenity and uses her power from the Spiral Heart Moon Rod to restore the city. Shortly afterwards, an infant Hotaru appears, fully reborn with the spirit of Saturn once again slumbering within her, prompting the Outer Guardians deciding to care for her while bidding farewell to Usagi and the Sailor Guardians, and leave to parts unknown.

After a brief encounter with a man wearing a tuxedo, the cat appears again, revealing her ability to speak and introducing herself as [[SM Luna|Luna]]. Luna gives Usagi a brooch that allows her to transform into a Sailor Guardian.  After transforming, Usagi hears a plea from Naru. Naru's mother had been replaced by a monster named [[Dark Kingdom#Morga|Morga]] who was using the jewelry family business to drain energy from those who bought them.

Panic-stricken, Super Sailor Chibi Moon calls out to Super Sailor Moon just as the Silence Glaive is sharply swung down on its edge.\n| LineColor       = DDAAFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = List of Sailor Moon Crystal episodes\n| EpisodeNumber   = 39\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = Infinity 12, Infinite\u2013Journey\n| TranslitTitle   = Mugen J\u016bni Mugendai\u2013Tabidachi\n| NativeTitle     = \u7121\u965012 \u7121\u9650\u5927\u2015\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy      = Chiaki Kon\n| WrittenBy       = Y\u016bji Kobayashi\n| Aux2            = Akira Takahashi\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|6|27}}\n| AltDate         = October 27, 2017\n| ShortSummary    = With Sailor Saturn finally awakened within Hotaru, she brings the utter annihilation of both Pharaoh 90 and the world. Usagi liberates the power she amassed to deal a fatal blow on the already fatally damaged Master Pharaoh 90. Seeing no need to wipe out Earth as Usagi is still alive, Saturn instead intercepts Pharaoh 90 during his attempted escape back into the Tau Star System and has Sailor Pluto use her Dark Dome Close to seal them both away. When the Legendary Silver Crystal evolves all the other Sailor Guardians to their Super forms, Usagi briefly transforms into Neo Queen Serenity and uses her power from the Spiral Heart Moon Rod to restore the city. Shortly afterwards, an infant Hotaru appears, fully reborn with the spirit of Saturn once again slumbering within her, prompting the Outer Guardians deciding to care for her while bidding farewell to Usagi and the Sailor Guardians, and leave to parts unknown. One year later at the beginning of April, Usagi and her friends are now 16-year-old high school students while Mamoru enrolls into a university. The day comes for Chibiusa to return to the 30th-century Earth after having completed her Sailor Guardian training. While watching a solar eclipse with Mamoru, Usagi and Chibiusa hear the clear and mysterious sound of a bell.\n| LineColor       = DDAAFF\n}}\n|}\n\n==Home video releases==\n\n===Japanese

A speech he holds at his wife Margarete's funeral reveals his deteriorating mental state. When his son Niko ([[Til Schweiger]]) and his granddaughter Tilda ([[Emma Schweiger]]) visit him, they see that he can no longer live on his own because of his mental condition. Niko convinces Amandus to move into his house near [[Hamburg]].\n\nNiko is married to Sarah (Jeanette Hain), but their marriage is in danger because his wife has a romance with her boss Serge ([[Jan Josef Liefers]]). Amanda's presence in the household causes disputes between Niko and Sarah. For example, Amandus nearly causes a fire in the kitchen while trying to bake a cake, which Sarah only prevents in the nick of time.\n\nWhile Amandus's mental state continues to degrade, a summer f\u00eate is thrown in the garden. Because of his disease, Amandus causes a disaster which leads to Sarah moving out. Niko now believes that moving his father to a [[retirement home]] has become inevitable. However, his daughter Tilda does not think that this is the way Amandus should be treated. Instead, she wants to travel to [[Venice]] with her grandfather, where he and his wife Margarete had spent their honeymoon. Tilda is told by her [[pediatrician]] Dr. Ehlers ([[Tilo Pr\u00fcckner]]) that visiting places the sick person knows well can help to live with the disease. They start their trip by car but soon get into a car crash which is caused by Amandus ignoring a red traffic light. Tilda then decides that they should go by train, which also fails when Amandus accidentally leaves the train. Tilda pulls the [[emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] to stop the train and runs after him. The police are now searching for them, so they hide in a toilet cabin. In the evening, the janitor Erdal ([[Fahri Yardim]]) finds them and helps the two continue their journey to Venice. Going by a sheep lorry, they get stopped by the police but manage to flee before they get caught, and find shelter in a [[monastery]]. The Mother Superior ([[Claudia Michelsen]]) is so touched by their story that she drives Tilda and Amandus to Venice.\n\nNiko and Sarah also arrive in Venice, looking for Tilda and Amandus. They check into the same hotel as Niko and Sarah, but they don't notice each other. Amandus leaves the hotel at night. Tilda notices in the morning go looking for him and find him sitting on a bench. It is revealed that while on honeymoon in Venice, Amandus had sat on that bench with his wife Margarete. His condition has advanced so far that he forgets he has a granddaughter, so he doesn't recognize Tilda. At that moment, Niko and Sarah find Tilda and Amandus, and the four travel back to Hamburg.\n\nSarah decides to [[career break|stop working]] so that she can take care of Amandus. The marriage of Niko and Sarah is saved when Sarah gives birth to a baby boy nine months later, whom they name after his grandfather. Amandus spends his remaining days contently with his family and dies of cardiac failure in Tilda's presence. At the funeral, Tilda lies in the grass and looks to the sky, because Amandus had promised he would protect her from heaven.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dieter Hallervorden]] - Amandus Rosenbach\n* [[Emma Schweiger]] - Tilda Rosenbach\n* [[Til Schweiger]] - Niko Rosenbach\n* [[Jeanette Hain]] - Sarah Rosenbach\n* [[Katharina Thalbach]] - Vivian Saalfeld\n* [[Tilo Pr\u00fcckner]] - Dr. Ehlers\n* [[Mehmet Kurtulu\u015f]] - Dr. Holst\n* [[Violetta Schurawlow]] - Nun\n* [[Pasquale Aleardi]] - Police Officer\n* [[Jan Josef Liefers]] - Serge\n* [[Fahri Yard\u0131m]] - Erdal\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has earned US$30.4 million at the box office.<ref name=deadline>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2015/01/international-box-office-night-at-the-museum-tomb-taken-3-american-sniper-unbroken-1201347113/|title= Strong Frame For Fox, Eastwood, Local Pics At International Box Office: Update|author= Nancy Tartaglione|date= January 13, 2015|accessdate= January 13, 2015|work= [[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref>\n\n==US Remake==\nOn March 21, 2018, German media announced that Til Schweiger would create a remake of ''Honig Im Kopf'' \u2013 with its literally translated name, ''Honey in the Head'' \u2013 for the US market, with him as director and with [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Matt Dillon]] as main cast members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stern.de/kultur/til-schweiger---honig-im-kopf--bekommt-us-version---mit-diesen-stars-7908826.html |title=\"Honig Im Kopf\" bekommt US-Version \u2013 Diese Hollywood-Stars sind Dabei |publisher=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern.de]] |date=2018-03-21 |accessdate=2018-03-21}}</ref> It was eventually also titled ''[[Head Full of Honey (2018 film)|Head Full of Honey]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://film.info/honigimkopf/}} {{in lang|de}}\n*{{IMDb title|3488462}}\n\n{{Til Schweiger}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT: Head Full Of Honey}}\n[[Category:2010s drama films]]\n[[Category: German drama films]]\n[[Category: German films]]\n[[Category: Films about Alzheimer's disease]]\n[[Category: Films directed by Til Schweiger]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the American remake|Head Full of Honey (2018 film)}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Head Full of Honey\n| image          = Honig Im Kopf.png\n| alt            = 200px\n| caption        = \n| film name      = <!--(for non-English films: film's name in its native language)-->\n| director       = [[Til Schweiger]]\n| producer       = [[Til Schweiger]]<br>[[Thomas Zickler]]\n| writer         = [[Til Schweiger]]\n| screenplay     = [[Til Schweiger]]<br>[[Hilly Martinek]]\n| story          = \n| based on       = <!-- {{based on |[title of the original work] |[writer of the original work]}} -->\n| starring       = [[Dieter Hallervorden]]<br>[[Emma Schweiger]]<br>[[Til Schweiger]]\n| narrator       = <!-- or: | narrators = -->\n| music          = [[Dirk Reichardt]]<br>[[Martin Todsharow]]<br>[[David J\u00fcrgens]]\n| cinematography = [[Martin Schlecht]]\n| editing        = \n| studio         = <!-- or: | production companies = -->\n| distributor    = <!-- or: | distributors = -->\n| released       = 15 December 2014\n| runtime        = 139 minutes\n| country        = Germany\n| language       = German\n| budget         = \n| gross          = US$30.4 million<!--(please use condensed and rounded values, e.g. \"\u00a311.6 million\" not \"\u00a311,586,221\")-->\n}}\n'''''Head Full of Honey''''' ({{lang-de|'''Honig im Kopf'''}}; lit.: '''''Honey in the Head''''') is a 2014 German [[drama film]] directed by [[Til Schweiger]].<ref name=viaberlin>{{cite web |url=http://www.via-berlin.com/enhonigimkopf.php |title=Start of production on \"Honig im Kopf\" |publisher=via-berlin.com |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> It was one of eight films [[short list|shortlisted]] by Germany to be their submission for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]],<ref name=\"Germany\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/germany-picks-final-eight-titles-to-vie-for-oscar-submission-20150813 |title=Germany Picks Final Eight Titles to Vie for Oscar Submission |work=IndieWire |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200403/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/germany-picks-final-eight-titles-to-vie-for-oscar-submission-20150813 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but it lost out to ''[[Labyrinth of Lies]]''.<ref name=\"Labyrinth\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-germany-picks-labryinth-lies-818100 |title=Oscars: Germany Picks 'Labryinth of Lies' for Foreign Language Category |last=Roxborough |first=Scott |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRetired [[veterinarian|vet]] Amandus ([[Dieter Hallervorden]]) suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

While searching for him with Enforcer Tomomi Masaoka, Akane learns about the nature of the Dominator, and the relationship between Enforcers and Inspectors. Enforcer Shuusei Kagari finds Okura, but due to Okura's drug use, the Dominator's ability to paralyze is rendered useless. Okura flees, and Unit One pursues him. While holding the hostage at knifepoint, Okura demands that the pursuing Akane and Masaoka hand their Dominators to him. After repeated failed attempts by Okura to use the Dominator, Enforcer [[Shinya Kogami]] shoots Okura lethally with his Dominator. Unit One learns that the hostage's Crime Coefficient has risen to a high level, which necessitates her execution. Before Kogami can execute her, Akane stops him with her Dominator's paralyzer. In the end, Akane manages to calm the woman down, letting her Crime Coefficient lower to the point where she can be paralyzed and taken away. Akane must explain her actions in a report to her superiors.\n| LineColor           = 575757\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Those Capable\n| TranslitTitle       = Nashi Uru Mono\n| NativeTitle         = \u6210\u3057\u3046\u308b\u8005\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Takayuki Hamana<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/02.html#story |script-title=ja:\u7b2c2\u8a71\u300c\u6210\u3057\u3046\u308b\u8005\u300d |publisher=Production I.G |language=Japanese |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PduC0reW?url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/02.html |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|19}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/02.html#onair_schedule |script-title=ja:\u7b2c2\u8a71\u300c\u6210\u3057\u3046\u308b\u8005\u300d |publisher=Production I.G |language=Japanese |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Pdu5ptGd?url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/02.html |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = Kogami remains hospitalized as he recovers from the Dominator-enforced paralysis; Akane begins a normal work day after meeting with friends and checks on his condition.

While searching for him with Enforcer Tomomi Masaoka, Akane learns about the nature of the Dominator, and the relationship between Enforcers and Inspectors. Enforcer Shuusei Kagari finds Okura, but due to Okura's drug use, the Dominator's ability to paralyze is rendered useless. Okura flees, and Unit One pursues him. While holding the hostage at knifepoint, Okura demands that the pursuing Akane and Masaoka hand their Dominators to him. After repeated failed attempts by Okura to use the Dominator, Enforcer [[Shinya Kogami]] shoots Okura lethally with his Dominator. Unit One learns that the hostage's Crime Coefficient has risen to a high level, which necessitates her execution. Before Kogami can execute her, Akane stops him with her Dominator's paralyzer. In the end, Akane manages to calm the woman down, letting her Crime Coefficient lower to the point where she can be paralyzed and taken away.

Later, Ginoza discusses with Masaoka, who is actually his father, about how Akane manages to keep her Psycho-Pass from becoming clouded.\n| LineColor           = 575757\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Sweet Poison\n| TranslitTitle       = Amai Doku\n| NativeTitle         = \u7518\u3044\u6bd2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Shunichi Yoshizawa<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/14.html#story |script-title=ja:\u7b2c14\u8a71\u300c\u7518\u3044\u6bd2\u300d |publisher=Production I.G |language=Japanese |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PdvVPAL4?url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/14.html |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2013|1|24}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/14.html#onair_schedule|script-title=ja:\u7b2c14\u8a71\u300c\u7518\u3044\u6bd2\u300d|publisher=Production I.G|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = A man in a helmet breaks into a pharmacy, kills the staff, and departs with drugs.

The same man attacks a woman in public, brutally beating her to death with a hammer in front of a crowd and a Psycho-Pass scanner. Later, the team learn that more culprits, wearing the same helmets, rob an armored car. Kogami deduces that the second crime would have a motive, leading their investigation to a man named Jyunmei Itoh who had a grudge against the victim. As Itoh attempts to escape, Kogami deduces that the helmets copy the low Crime Coefficients of innocent bystanders, thus help criminals avoid apprehension.
