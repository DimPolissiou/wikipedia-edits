In 2014, the total output was {{convert|382341|hl|usbeerbbl|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Beteiligungsbericht\" /> The brewery advertises itself as \"The World's Oldest Brewery\", although this claim is disputed.<ref name=\"Zeit\">{{cite news |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711213403/http://www.zeit.de/2012/23/Bier-Flaschenkunde/komplettansicht |title=Flaschenkunde |author=Christof Siemes , Georg Etscheit , Claas Tatje , Karin Ceballos Betancur and Gunhild L\u00fctge |date=2012-05-31 |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |access-date=2017-01-05 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nUntil the 1950s, the brewery described its date of foundation as the year 1146. At this time, a document allegedly dating to the year 1040 resurfaced. In it, [[Otto of Freising|Otto I]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Bishop of Freising]] bestowed a [[brewing right]] upon the abbey. The document is generally dismissed as a forgery from the early 1600s. The first written record of the brewery dates to the year 1675.<ref name=\"Zeit\" /> Another source, dating to 768, indicates the presence of a [[hops]] garden nearby.<ref name=\"Zeit\" />\n\n===State Brewery===\nIn 1803, as part of a larger wave of [[German mediatization|German secularization]], Weihenstephan Abbey was dissolved. The cloister passed into ownership of the Bavarian government, where it was incorporated as the  ''K\u00f6niglich Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan'' (''Royal Bavarian Brewery Weihenstephan'').<ref name=\"Beteiligungsbericht\" /> In 1921, the brewery adopted its current name. Today, although it is fully owned by the government of Bavaria, it is run as a modern enterprise in line with private sector practices.

In it, [[Otto of Freising|Otto I]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Bishop of Freising]] bestowed a [[brewing right]] upon the abbey. The document is generally dismissed as a forgery from the early 1600s.
