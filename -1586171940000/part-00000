For the EPs by Ladies' Code|Code 01 Bad Girl|Code 02 Pretty Pretty}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2010}}\n[[File:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|290px|Morse code, a famous type of code]] \nIn [[communication]]s and [[information processing]], '''code''' is a system of rules to convert [[information]]\u2014such as a [[letter (alphabet)|letter]], [[word]], sound, image, or [[gesture]]\u2014into another form or representation, sometimes [[data compression|shortened]] or [[secrecy|secret]], for communication through a [[communication channel]] or storage in a [[storage medium]]. An early example is the invention of [[language]], which enabled a person, through [[speech]], to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of [[writing]], which converted spoken language into [[visual system|visual]] [[symbol]]s, extended the range of communication across [[space]] and [[time]].\n\nThe process of '''encoding''' converts information from a [[communication source|source]] into symbols for communication or storage. '''Decoding''' is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or Spanish.\n\nOne reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary [[plain language]], spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, [[semaphore]], where the configuration of [[Flag semaphore|flags]] held by a signaler or the arms of a [[semaphore line|semaphore tower]] encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.\n\n== Theory ==\n{{main|Coding theory}}\nIn [[information theory]] and [[computer science]], a code is usually considered as an [[algorithm]] that uniquely represents [[symbols]] from some source [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], by ''encoded'' strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.\n\nBefore giving a mathematically precise definition, this is a brief example. The mapping\n:<math>C = \\{\\, a\\mapsto 0, b\\mapsto 01, c\\mapsto 011\\,\\}</math>\nis a code, whose source alphabet is the set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math> and whose target alphabet is the set <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string 0011001011 can be grouped into codewords as 0\u2002011\u20020\u200201\u2002011, and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols ''acabc''.\n\nUsing terms from [[formal language theory]], the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]], respectively. A '''code''' <math>C:\\, S \\to T^*</math> is a [[total function]] mapping each symbol from S to a [[String (computer science)|sequence of symbols]] over T, and the extension of <math>C</math> to a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms and e-free homomorphisms in formal language theory|homomorphism]] of <math>S^*</math> into <math>T^*</math>, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols, is referred to as its '''extension'''.\n\n=== Variable-length codes ===\n{{main|Variable-length code}}\nCodes that encode each source (clear text) character by a [[code word]] from some dictionary, and [[concatenation]] of such code words give us an encoded string. Variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities; see also [[entropy encoding]].\n\nA ''prefix code'' is a code with the \"prefix property\": there is no valid code word in the system that is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] (start) of any other valid code word in the set. [[Huffman coding]] is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes. Prefix codes are widely referred to as \"Huffman codes\" even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm. Other examples of prefix codes are [[country calling codes]], the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s, and the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA|WCDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard.\n\n[[Kraft's inequality]] characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessary a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.\n\n=== Error-correcting codes ===\n{{main|Error detection and correction}}\n{{see also|Block code}}\nCodes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage. This so-called [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting code]] works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted) data. Examples include [[Hamming code]]s, [[Reed\u2013Solomon]], [[Reed\u2013Muller code|Reed\u2013Muller]], [[Walsh\u2013Hadamard code|Walsh\u2013Hadamard]], [[BCH code|Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hochquenghem]], [[Turbo code|Turbo]], [[Binary Golay code|Golay]], [[Goppa code|Goppa]], [[low-density parity-check code]]s, and [[space\u2013time code]]s.\nError detecting codes can be optimised to detect ''burst errors'', or ''random errors''.\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Codes in communication used for brevity ===\nA cable code replaces words (e.g. ''ship'' or ''invoice'') with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent with fewer [[character (computing)|characters]], more quickly, and less expensively.\n\nCodes can be used for brevity. When [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] messages were the state of the art in rapid long-distance communication, elaborate systems of [[commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] that encoded complete phrases into single mouths (commonly five-minute groups) were developed, so that telegraphers became conversant with such \"words\" as ''BYOXO'' (\"Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?\"), ''LIOUY'' (\"Why do you not answer my question?\"), ''BMULD'' (\"You're a skunk!\"), or ''AYYLU'' (\"Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly.\"). [[Code word]]s were chosen for various reasons: [[length]], [[pronounceability]], etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front for the American [[Black Chamber]] run by [[Herbert Yardley]] between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for [[data compression]] predates the computer era; an early example is the telegraph [[Morse code]] where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as [[Huffman coding]] are now used by computer-based [[algorithm]]s to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission.\n\n=== Character encodings ===\n{{Main|Character encoding}}\nCharacter encodings are representations of textual data. A given character encoding may be associated with a specific character set (the collection of characters which it can represent), though some character sets have multiple character encodings and vice versa. Character encodings may be broadly grouped according to the number of bytes required to represent a single character: there are single byte encodings, [[Wide character|multibyte]] (also called wide) encodings, and [[Variable-width encoding|variable-width]] (also called variable-length) encodings. The earliest character encodings were single-byte, the best known example of which is [[ASCII]]. ASCII remains in use today, for example in [[HTTP headers]]. However, single-byte encodings cannot model character sets with more than 256 characters. Scripts which require large character sets such as [[CJK|Chinese, Japanese and Korean]] must be represented with multibyte encodings. Early multibyte encodings were fixed-length, meaning that although each character was represented by more than one byte, all characters used the same number of bytes (\"word length\"), making them suitable for decoding with a lookup table. The final group, variable-width encodings, is a subset of multibyte encodings. These use more complex encoding and decoding logic to efficiently represent large character sets while keeping the representations of more commonly used characters shorter or maintaining backwards compatibility properties. This group includes [[UTF-8]], an encoding of the [[Unicode]] character set; UTF-8 is the most common encoding of text media on the Internet.\n\n=== Genetic code ===\n{{Main|Genetic code}}\n[[Biology|Biological]] organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development. This is [[DNA]], which contains units named [[gene]]s from which [[messenger RNA]] is derived.

For the EPs by Ladies' Code|Code 01 Bad Girl|Code 02 Pretty Pretty}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n[[File:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|290px|Morse code, a famous type of code]] \nIn [[communication]]s and [[information processing]], '''code''' is a system of rules to convert [[information]]\u2014such as a [[letter (alphabet)|letter]], [[word]], sound, image, or [[gesture]]\u2014into another form or representation, sometimes [[data compression|shortened]] or [[secrecy|secret]], for communication through a [[communication channel]] or storage in a [[storage medium]]. An early example is the invention of [[language]], which enabled a person, through [[speech]], to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of [[writing]], which converted spoken language into [[visual system|visual]] [[symbol]]s, extended the range of communication across [[space]] and [[time]].\n\nThe process of '''encoding''' converts information from a [[communication source|source]] into symbols for communication or storage. '''Decoding''' is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or Spanish.\n\nOne reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary [[plain language]], spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, [[semaphore]], where the configuration of [[Flag semaphore|flags]] held by a signaler or the arms of a [[semaphore line|semaphore tower]] encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.\n\n== Theory ==\n\n{{main article|Coding theory}}\nIn [[information theory]] and [[computer science]], a code is usually considered as an [[algorithm]] that uniquely represents [[symbols]] from some source [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], by ''encoded'' strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.\n\nBefore giving a mathematically precise definition, this is a brief example. The mapping\n:<math>C = \\{\\, a\\mapsto 0, b\\mapsto 01, c\\mapsto 011\\,\\}</math>\nis a code, whose source alphabet is the set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math> and whose target alphabet is the set <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string 0011001011 can be grouped into codewords as 0\u2002011\u20020\u200201\u2002011, and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols ''acabc''.\n\nUsing terms from [[formal language theory]], the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]], respectively. A '''code''' <math>C:\\, S \\to T^*</math> is a [[total function]] mapping each symbol from S to a [[String (computer science)|sequence of symbols]] over T, and the extension of <math>C</math> to a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms and e-free homomorphisms in formal language theory|homomorphism]] of <math>S^*</math> into <math>T^*</math>, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols, is referred to as its '''extension'''.\n\n=== Variable-length codes ===\n{{Main article|Variable-length code}}\nCodes that encode each source (clear text) character by a [[code word]] from some dictionary, and [[concatenation]] of such code words give us an encoded string. Variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities; see also [[entropy encoding]].\n\nA ''prefix code'' is a code with the \"prefix property\": there is no valid code word in the system that is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] (start) of any other valid code word in the set. [[Huffman coding]] is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes. Prefix codes are widely referred to as \"Huffman codes\" even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm. Other examples of prefix codes are [[country calling codes]], the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s, and the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA|WCDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard.\n\n[[Kraft's inequality]] characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessary a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.\n\n=== Error-correcting codes ===\n{{Main article|Error detection and correction}}\n{{see also|Block code}}\nCodes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage. This so-called [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting code]] works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted) data. Examples include [[Hamming code]]s, [[Reed\u2013Solomon]], [[Reed\u2013Muller code|Reed\u2013Muller]], [[Walsh\u2013Hadamard code|Walsh\u2013Hadamard]], [[BCH code|Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hochquenghem]], [[Turbo code|Turbo]], [[Binary Golay code|Golay]], [[Goppa code|Goppa]], [[low-density parity-check code]]s, and [[space\u2013time code]]s.\nError detecting codes can be optimised to detect ''burst errors'', or ''random errors''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Codes in communication used for brevity ===\nA cable code replaces words (e.g. ''ship'' or ''invoice'') with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent with fewer [[character (computing)|characters]], more quickly, and less expensively.\n\nCodes can be used for brevity. When [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] messages were the state of the art in rapid long distance communication, elaborate systems of [[commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] that encoded complete phrases into single mouths (commonly five-minute groups) were developed, so that telegraphers became conversant with such \"words\" as ''BYOXO'' (\"Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?\"), ''LIOUY'' (\"Why do you not answer my question?\"), ''BMULD'' (\"You're a skunk!\"), or ''AYYLU'' (\"Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly.\"). [[Code word]]s were chosen for various reasons: [[length]], [[pronounceability]], etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front for the American [[Black Chamber]] run by [[Herbert Yardley]] between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for [[data compression]] predates the computer era; an early example is the telegraph [[Morse code]] where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as [[Huffman coding]] are now used by computer-based [[algorithm]]s to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission.\n\n=== Character encodings ===\n{{Main article|Character encoding}}\nCharacter encodings are representations of textual data. A given character encoding may be associated with a specific character set (the collection of characters which it can represent), though some character sets have multiple character encodings and vice versa. Character encodings may be broadly grouped according to the number of bytes required to represent a single character: there are single byte encodings, [[Wide_character|multibyte]] (also called wide) encodings, and [[Variable-width_encoding|variable-width]] (also called variable-length) encodings. The earliest character encodings were single-byte, the best known example of which is [[ASCII]]. ASCII remains in use today, for example in [[HTTP headers]]. However, single-byte encodings cannot model character sets with more than 256 characters. Scripts which require large character sets such as [[CJK|Chinese, Japanese and Korean]] must be represented with multibyte encodings. Early multibyte encodings were fixed-length, meaning that although each character was represented by more than one byte, all characters used the same number of bytes (\"word length\"), making them suitable for decoding with a lookup table. The final group, variable-width encodings, is a subset of multibyte encodings. These use more complex encoding and decoding logic to efficiently represent large character sets while keeping the representations of more commonly used characters shorter or maintaining backwards compatibility properties. This group includes [[UTF-8]], an encoding of the [[Unicode]] character set; UTF-8 is the most common encoding of text media on the Internet.\n\n=== Genetic code ===\n{{Main article|Genetic code}}\n[[Biology|Biological]] organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development. This is [[DNA]], which contains units named [[gene]]s from which [[messenger RNA]] is derived. This in turn produces [[protein]]s through a [[genetic code]] in which a series of triplets ([[codon]]s) of four possible [[nucleotides]] can be translated into one of twenty possible [[amino acid]]s. A sequence of codons results in a corresponding sequence of amino acids that form a protein molecule; a type of codon called a [[stop codon]] signals the end of the sequence.\n\n===G\u00f6del code===\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[G\u00f6del code]] was the basis for the proof of [[G\u00f6del]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]]. Here, the idea was to map [[mathematical notation]] to a [[natural number]] (using a [[G\u00f6del numbering]]).\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThere are codes using colors, like [[traffic lights]], the [[Electronic color code|color code]] employed to mark the nominal value of the [[Resistor|electrical resistor]]s or that of the trashcans devoted to specific types of garbage (paper, glass, organic, etc.).\n\nIn [[marketing]], [[coupon]] codes can be used for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product from a (usually internet) retailer.\n\nIn military environments, specific sounds with the [[cornet]] are used for different uses: to mark some moments of the day, to command the infantry on the battlefield, etc.\n\nCommunication systems for sensory impairments, such as [[sign language]] for deaf people and [[braille]] for blind people, are based on movement or tactile codes.\n\n[[Sheet music|Musical scores]] are the most common way to encode [[music]].\n\nSpecific games have their own code systems to record the matches, e.g. [[chess notation]].\n\n=== Cryptography ===\nIn the [[history of cryptography]], [[Code (cryptography)|codes]] were once common for ensuring the confidentiality of communications, although [[cipher]]s are now used instead.\n\nSecret codes intended to obscure the real messages, ranging from serious (mainly [[espionage]] in military, diplomacy, business, etc.) to trivial (romance, games) can be any kind of imaginative encoding: [[Language of flowers|flowers]], game cards, clothes, fans, hats, melodies, birds, etc., in which the sole requisite is the pre-agreement on the meaning by both the sender and the receiver.\n\n== Other examples ==\n\nOther examples of encoding include:\n*Encoding (in [[cognition]]) - a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli; technically speaking, it is a complex, multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory input (e.g., light, sound) into subjectively meaningful experience.\n*A [[content format]] - a specific encoding format for converting a specific type of [[data]] to [[information]].\n*Text encoding uses a [[markup language]] to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers.

They are part of [[Christmas]] celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Australia]] (where they are sometimes known as '''bon-bons'''), [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].\n\nA cracker consists of a segmented [[Paperboard|cardboard]] tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the middle,<ref name=\"bbc america\">{{cite web|last=McAlpine|first=Fraser|title=Part 3: Crackers|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/12/a-very-british-christmas-crackers/|work=A Very British Christmas|publisher=BBC America|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=7 December 2011}}</ref> making it resemble an oversized [[Candy#Packaging|sweet-wrapper]]. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize.<ref name=\"bbc america\"/> The split is accompanied by a mild bang or snapping sound produced by the effect of friction on a [[shock sensitivity|shock-sensitive]], chemically impregnated card strip (similar to that used in a [[cap gun]]).<ref name=\"bbc america\" /> One chemical used for the friction strip is [[silver fulminate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Christmas Crackers USA|url=http://christmas-crackers-usa.com/faqs.htm|accessdate=3 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Tradition==\nCrackers are typically pulled at the Christmas dinner table or at parties. In one version of the cracker tradition, the person with the larger portion of cracker empties the contents from the tube and keeps them. In another, each person has their own cracker and keeps its contents regardless of whose end they were in. Typically these contents are a coloured paper hat, a small [[toy]], a small [[plastic]] model or other trinket, and a [[motto]], a [[joke]], a [[riddle]] or piece of trivia on a small strip of [[paper]].<ref>Rarely, they can be much more substantial. In 2009, [[Harrod's]] offered a version of Christmas cracker retailing at $1,000: [http://elitechoice.org/2009/11/10/harrods-luxury-6-christmas-cracker-collection-bling-it-up-this-festive-season/ \"Harrods Luxury 6 Christmas Cracker Collection: Bling it up this festive season!\"]</ref> The paper hats, with the appearance of crowns, are usually worn when eating [[Christmas dinner]]. The tradition of wearing festive hats is believed to date back to Roman times and the [[Saturnalia]] celebrations, which also involved decorative headgear.<ref name=\"bbc america\" />\n\nChristmas crackers are also associated with [[Knut's party|Knut's parties]], held in Sweden at the end of the Christmas season.\n\n==History==\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the use of ''cracker bonbons'' and the pulling of ''crackers'' from 1847.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43642#eid7942684 OED, Second edition], 1989; online version November 2010..
