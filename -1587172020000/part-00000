They each seek to find the singing partners best suited for them for the perfect harmony collaboration performances, and compete which is the better one.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction and concept to Oh!

My Part, You|url=http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/ent/ohmypart/apply/}}</ref>\n\n===Rules===\n* First Round: The Part Song will be sung by all the contestants which are seen to be singing, but only 1 contestant is actually singing while the other contestants are lip-syncing. In the song performance, once the \"Part Change\" shows, the singing contestant will be changed to another contestant. Based on this round, the Song Masters each pick 1 contestant. After this round, the contestants picked will each perform a song as revelation of their identities.\n** For the regular broadcast, there are 2 Part Songs (1 each by the Song Masters), and after the first Part Song, the team with the selection priority will choose 1 contestant from the 5. Then, after the second Part Song, the other team will choose 1 contestant from the remaining 4. If one team guessed the correct singing part to the contestant chosen, the original singing voice will be played. If not, an auto-tuned voice will be played.\n* Second Round: Hints to the 3 contestants not yet chosen are given first. The first round is then replayed among the 3 contestants. Based on this round, the Song Masters each pick 1 contestant. After this round, the contestants picked will each perform a song as revelation of their identities. The 1 contestant not chosen after both rounds is eliminated, but will perform a song on stage before leaving.\n** For the regular broadcast, the hints are given only to the winning team by guessing correctly the songs that assistant host Im Hyun-joo is humming to.\n* If both Song Masters have chosen the same contestant, the contestant himself/herself will choose which Song Master he/she wants to collaborate with.\n* The final battle will be between 2 teams of 3 singers (1 Song Master and 2 contestants picked by the Song Master). Both teams have 30 minutes to practice their collaborations before performing. For the regular broadcast, the time given is 1 hour instead.\n* The audience of 100 people will rate their performances, and the team with more points wins. For the regular broadcast, due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in South Korea]] there will not be any audience. Instead, several MBC announcers forming the judge squad will decide the results.\n\n==Cast==\nBased on the official website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cast of Oh!
