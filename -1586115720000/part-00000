[[Henan]] province. Governed as a [[prefecture-level city]], it borders the provincial capital of [[Zhengzhou]] to the east, [[Pingdingshan]] to the southeast, [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] to the south, [[Sanmenxia]] to the west, [[Jiyuan]] to the north, and [[Jiaozuo]] to the northeast. As of the final 2010 census, Luoyang had a population of 6,549,941 inhabitants with 1,857,003 people living in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of the city's five urban districts, all of which except the [[Jili District]] are not urbanized yet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/china-henan-admin.php|title=China: H\u00e9n\u00e1n|website=China Population|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nSituated on the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]] of China, Luoyang is one of the [[History of China#Ancient China|cradles of Chinese civilization]], and is one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Four Great Ancient Capitals of China]].\n\n==Names==\n\nThe name \"Luoyang\" originates from the city's location on the north or sunny ([[Yin and yang#Toponymy|\"yang\"]]) side of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]]. Since the river flows from west to east and the sun is to the south of the river, the sun always shines on the north side of the river. Luoyang has had several names over the centuries, including \"Luoyi\" ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u9091}}) and \"Luozhou ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u5dde}})\", though Luoyang has been its primary name. It has been called, during various periods, \"Dongdu\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e1c\u90fd}}, meaning the Eastern Capital, during the [[Tang dynasty]]), \"Xijing\" ({{lang|zh|\u897f\u4eac}}, meaning the Western Capital, during the [[Song dynasty]]), or \"Jingluo\" ({{lang|zh|\u4eac\u6d1b}}, meaning the general capital for China). During the rule of [[Wu Zetian]], the city was known as Shendu (\u795e\u90fd divine capital)\n\n==History==\n[[File:Longmen Grottoes 3.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px|[[Longmen Grottoes]]]]\n[[File:\u5929\u5b50\u9a7e\u516d.jpg|thumb|left|261x261px|Museum of Luoyang Eastern Zhou Royal Horse and Chariot Pits]]\n[[File:Luoyang in Han Dynasty.gif|395x395px|thumb|Map of Luoyang during the Eastern Han dynasty when it was the capital of China]]\n[[File:China-henan-luoyang-white-horse-temple-entrance-20040506.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|[[White Horse Temple]] gate]]\n{{further2|[[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]]}}\n\nThe greater Luoyang area has been sacred ground since the late [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Far East Kingdoms |url=https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/ChinaCultures.htm |website=Early Chinese Cultures |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> This area at the intersection of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo river]] and [[Yi River (China)|Yi River]] was considered to be the geographical center of China.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Because of this sacred aspect, several cities \u2013 all of which are generally referred to as \"Luoyang\" \u2013 have been built in this area. In 2070&nbsp;BC, the [[Xia dynasty]] king [[Tai Kang]] moved the Xia capital to the intersection of the Luo and Yi and named the city [[Zhenxun]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u659f\u9129}}). In 1600&nbsp;BC, [[Tang of Shang]] defeated [[Jie of Xia|Jie]], the final Xia dynasty king, and built Western Bo ({{lang|zh|\u897f\u4eb3}}), a new capital on the Luo River. The ruins of Western Bo are located in Luoyang Prefecture.\n\nIn the 1036&nbsp;BC a settlement named Chengzhou ({{lang|zh|\u6210\u5468}}) was constructed by the [[Duke of Zhou]] for the remnants of the captured [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] nobility. The Duke also moved the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]] to [[Chengzhou]] from the [[Zhou dynasty]] capital at [[Haojing]]. A second Western Zhou capital, [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]] (also: Luoyi) was built {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} west of Chengzhou.  Wangcheng became the capital of the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] in 771&nbsp;BC.  The Eastern Zhou Dynasty capital was moved to Chengzhou in 510&nbsp;BC. Later, the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] capital of Luoyang would be built over Chengzhou.  Modern Luoyang is built over the ruins of Wangcheng, which are still visible today at Wangcheng Park.<ref>China.org.cn, 2009</ref>\n\n[[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Shi Huang's]] chief minister, Lu Buwei, was given Luoyang as a marquess.

In 26, the Altar of the Gods of the Soils and Grains, the Altar of Heaven, and the Temple of the eminent Founder, [[Emperor Gao]] of Former Han were inaugurated.  The Imperial University was restored in 29.  In 48, the Yang Canal linked the capital to the Luo.

In AD 68, the [[White Horse Temple]], the first [[Buddhist]] temple in China, was founded in Luoyang. The temple still exists, though the architecture is of later origin, mainly from the 16th century. [[An Shigao]] was one of the first monks to popularize Buddhism in Luoyang.\n\nThe [[Ban Chao|ambassador Banchao]] restored the [[Silk Road]] in Eastern Han dynasty and this has made the capital city Luoyang the start of Silk Road\n\nIn 166 AD, the first [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman mission]], sent by \"the king of Da Qin [the Roman Empire], Andun\" ([[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]], r. 161\u2013180 AD), reached Luoyang after arriving by sea in Rinan Commandery in what is now central [[Vietnam]].<ref>Hill (2009), p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe late 2nd century saw China decline into anarchy:\n<blockquote>The decline was accelerated by the rebellion of the [[Yellow Turbans]], who, although defeated by the Imperial troops in 184 AD, weakened the state to the point where there was a continuing series of rebellions degenerating into civil war, culminating in the burning of the Han capital of Luoyang on 24 September 189 AD. This was followed by a state of continual unrest and wars in China until a modicum of stability returned in the 220s, but with the establishment of three separate kingdoms, rather than a unified empire.<ref>Hill (2009), p. xvi,</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 190 AD, Chancellor [[Dong Zhuo]] ordered his soldiers to ransack, pillage, and raze the city as he retreated from [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|the coalition set up against him]] by regional lords all across China. The court was subsequently moved to the more defensible western city of [[Chang'an]]. Following a period of disorder, during which warlord [[Cao Cao]] held the last Han emperor [[Han Xiandi|Xian]] in [[Xuchang]] (196\u2013220), Luoyang was restored to prominence when his son Cao Pi, [[Cao Pi|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]], declared it his capital in 220 AD. The [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], successor to Wei, was also established in Luoyang.\n\nWhen Jin was overrun by [[Xiongnu]] forces in 311 AD, it was forced to move its capital to [[Jiankang]] (modern day [[Nanjing]]). The Xiongnu warriors then sacked and nearly totally destroyed Luoyang. The same fate befell [[Chang'an]] in 316 AD.<ref name=Rene>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/56 56\u201357] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/56 }}</ref>\n\nIn winter 416, Luoyang fell to [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]]'s general [[Tan Daoji]]. In 422, Luoyang was captured by [[Northern Wei]]. [[Liu Song]] general Dao Yanzhi took the city back, but by 439 the Wei conquered the city definitively. In 493 AD, [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] of the Northern Wei dynasty moved the capital from [[Datong]] to Luoyang and started the construction of the [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[Longmen Grottoes]]. More than 30,000 [[Buddhist]] statues from the time of this dynasty have been found in the caves. Many of these sculptures were two-faced. At the same time, the [[Shaolin Temple]] was also built by the Emperor to accommodate an Indian monk on the Mont Song right next to Luoyang City. The [[Yongning Pagoda|Yongning Temple]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6c38\u5b81\u5bfa}}), the tallest pagoda in China, was also built in Luoyang.\n\nWhen [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] took control in 604 AD he founded the new Luoyang on the site of the existing city using a layout inspired by his father [[Emperor Wen of Sui]]'s work in newly rebuilt Chang'an.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Robert B.|last=Marks|title=China: Its Environment and History|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXVHL2mYajAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=China:+Its+Environment+and+History&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QK3HUsPSBpKqhAfaooGABw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=emperor%20yang%20of%20sui&f=false|ISBN=1442212756}} p. 116</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Schinz|first=Alfred|year=1996|title=The Magic Square: Cities in Ancient China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhcRYkz-I3YC&pg=PA380&lpg=PA380&dq=The+Magic+Square:+Cities+in+Ancient+China&source=bl&ots=Y8DFplSi-a&sig=cjWM3YUsF7Pv7y5emD_3Kws5UgE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vKvHUoDUCcSBhAfTv4HIBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=luoyang&f=false|ISBN=3930698021}} p. 167-169.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Tang dynasty]], Luoyang was Dongdu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e1c\u90fd}}), the \"Eastern Capital\", and at its height had a population of around one million, second only to Chang'an, which, at the time, was the largest city in the world.<ref>Abramson (2008), p. viii.</ref>\n\nAt the interval of Tang dynasty, the first and the only empress in Chinese history \u2013 [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], moved the capital of her Zhou Dynasty to Luoyang and named it as Shen Du (Capital of the God). She constructed the tallest palace in Chinese history, which is now in the site of Sui Tang Luoyang city. Luoyang was heavily damaged during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the short-lived Five Dynasties, Luoyang was the capital of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] (only for a few years before the court moved to [[Kaifeng]]) and [[Later Tang]].\n\nDuring the North [[Song dynasty]], Luoyang was the 'Western Capital' and birthplace of Zhao Kuangyin, the founder of the Song dynasty. It served as a prominent culture center, housing some of the most important philosophers. This prosperity was mainly caused by Luoyang undergoing new developments and reconstruction during this period.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], Luoyang was the \"Middle Capital\".\n\nSince the [[Yuan dynasty]], Luoyang was no longer the capital of China in the rest of the ancient dynasties. During the Yuan and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, Luoyang was razed and rebuilt twice. It's walls were destroyed by peasant rebels in the late Ming period. The city walls were then rebuilt during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasty.<ref name=\":0\" /> The population was reduced to that of an average county. However, for one last time, Luoyang city was the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] for a brief period of time during the Japanese invasion. By 1949, Luoyang's population was 75,000.\n\nAfter the People's Republic of China was established, Luoyang was revived as a major heavy industrial hub.

[[Henan]] province. Governed as a [[prefecture-level city]], it borders the provincial capital of [[Zhengzhou]] to the east, [[Pingdingshan]] to the southeast, [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] to the south, [[Sanmenxia]] to the west, [[Jiyuan]] to the north, and [[Jiaozuo]] to the northeast. As of the final 2010 census, Luoyang had a population of 6,549,941 inhabitants with 1,857,003 people living in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of the city's five urban districts, all of which except the [[Jili District]] are not urbanized yet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/china-henan-admin.php|title=China: H\u00e9n\u00e1n|website=China Population|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nSituated on the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]] of China, Luoyang is one of the [[History of China#Ancient China|cradles of Chinese civilization]], and is one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Four Great Ancient Capitals of China]].\n\n==Names==\n\nThe name \"Luoyang\" originates from the city's location on the north or sunny ([[Yin and yang#Toponymy|\"yang\"]]) side of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]]. Since the river flows from west to east and the sun is to the south of the river, the sun always shines on the north side of the river. Luoyang has had several names over the centuries, including \"Luoyi\" ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u9091}}) and \"Luozhou ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u5dde}})\", though Luoyang has been its primary name. It has been called, during various periods, \"Dongdu\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e1c\u90fd}}, meaning the Eastern Capital, during the [[Tang dynasty]]), \"Xijing\" ({{lang|zh|\u897f\u4eac}}, meaning the Western Capital, during the [[Song dynasty]]), or \"Jingluo\" ({{lang|zh|\u4eac\u6d1b}}, meaning the general capital for China). During the rule of [[Wu Zetian]], the city was known as Shendu (\u795e\u90fd divine capital)\n\n==History==\n[[File:Longmen Grottoes 3.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px|[[Longmen Grottoes]]]]\n[[File:\u5929\u5b50\u9a7e\u516d.jpg|thumb|left|261x261px|Museum of Luoyang Eastern Zhou Royal Horse and Chariot Pits]]\n[[File:Luoyang in Han Dynasty.gif|395x395px|thumb|Map of Luoyang during the Eastern Han dynasty when it was the capital of China]]\n[[File:China-henan-luoyang-white-horse-temple-entrance-20040506.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|[[White Horse Temple]] gate]]\n{{further2|[[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]]}}\n\nThe greater Luoyang area has been sacred ground since the late [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Far East Kingdoms |url=https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/ChinaCultures.htm |website=Early Chinese Cultures |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> This area at the intersection of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo river]] and [[Yi River (China)|Yi River]] was considered to be the geographical center of China.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Because of this sacred aspect, several cities \u2013 all of which are generally referred to as \"Luoyang\" \u2013 have been built in this area. In 2070&nbsp;BC, the [[Xia dynasty]] king [[Tai Kang]] moved the Xia capital to the intersection of the Luo and Yi and named the city [[Zhenxun]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u659f\u9129}}). In 1600&nbsp;BC, [[Tang of Shang]] defeated [[Jie of Xia|Jie]], the final Xia dynasty king, and built Western Bo ({{lang|zh|\u897f\u4eb3}}), a new capital on the Luo River. The ruins of Western Bo are located in Luoyang Prefecture.\n\nIn the 1036&nbsp;BC a settlement named Chengzhou ({{lang|zh|\u6210\u5468}}) was constructed by the [[Duke of Zhou]] for the remnants of the captured [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] nobility. The Duke also moved the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]] to [[Chengzhou]] from the [[Zhou dynasty]] capital at [[Haojing]]. A second Western Zhou capital, [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]] (also: Luoyi) was built {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} west of Chengzhou.  Wangcheng became the capital of the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] in 771&nbsp;BC.  The Eastern Zhou Dynasty capital was moved to Chengzhou in 510&nbsp;BC. Later, the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] capital of Luoyang would be built over Chengzhou.  Modern Luoyang is built over the ruins of Wangcheng, which are still visible today at Wangcheng Park.<ref>China.org.cn, 2009</ref>\n\n[[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Shi Huang's]] chief minister, Lu Buwei, was given Luoyang as a marquess.

In 26, the Altar of the Gods of the Soils and Grains, the Altar of Heaven, and the Temple of the eminent Founder, [[Emperor Gao]] of Former Han were inaugurated.  The Imperial University was restored in 29.  In 48, the Yang Canal linked the capital to the Luo.

In AD 68, the [[White Horse Temple]], the first [[Buddhist]] temple in China, was founded in Luoyang. The temple still exists, though the architecture is of later origin, mainly from the 16th century. [[An Shigao]] was one of the first monks to popularize Buddhism in Luoyang.\n\nThe [[Ban Chao|ambassador Banchao]] restored the [[Silk Road]] in Eastern Han dynasty and this has made the capital city Luoyang the start of Silk Road\n\nIn 166 AD, the first [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman mission]], sent by \"the king of Da Qin [the Roman Empire], Andun\" ([[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]], r. 161\u2013180 AD), reached Luoyang after arriving by sea in Rinan Commandery in what is now central [[Vietnam]].<ref>Hill (2009), p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe late 2nd century saw China decline into anarchy:\n<blockquote>The decline was accelerated by the rebellion of the [[Yellow Turbans]], who, although defeated by the Imperial troops in 184 AD, weakened the state to the point where there was a continuing series of rebellions degenerating into civil war, culminating in the burning of the Han capital of Luoyang on 24 September 189 AD. This was followed by a state of continual unrest and wars in China until a modicum of stability returned in the 220s, but with the establishment of three separate kingdoms, rather than a unified empire.<ref>Hill (2009), p. xvi,</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 190 AD, Chancellor [[Dong Zhuo]] ordered his soldiers to ransack, pillage, and raze the city as he retreated from [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|the coalition set up against him]] by regional lords all across China. The court was subsequently moved to the more defensible western city of [[Chang'an]]. Following a period of disorder, during which warlord [[Cao Cao]] held the last Han emperor [[Han Xiandi|Xian]] in [[Xuchang]] (196\u2013220), Luoyang was restored to prominence when his son Cao Pi, [[Cao Pi|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]], declared it his capital in 220 AD. The [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], successor to Wei, was also established in Luoyang.\n\nWhen Jin was overrun by [[Xiongnu]] forces in 311 AD, it was forced to move its capital to [[Jiankang]] (modern day [[Nanjing]]). The Xiongnu warriors then sacked and nearly totally destroyed Luoyang. The same fate befell [[Chang'an]] in 316 AD.<ref name=Rene>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/56 56\u201357] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/56 }}</ref>\n\nIn winter 416, Luoyang fell to [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]]'s general [[Tan Daoji]]. In 422, Luoyang was captured by [[Northern Wei]]. [[Liu Song]] general Dao Yanzhi took the city back, but by 439 the Wei conquered the city definitively. In 493 AD, [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] of the Northern Wei dynasty moved the capital from [[Datong]] to Luoyang and started the construction of the [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[Longmen Grottoes]]. More than 30,000 [[Buddhist]] statues from the time of this dynasty have been found in the caves. Many of these sculptures were two-faced. At the same time, the [[Shaolin Temple]] was also built by the Emperor to accommodate an Indian monk on the Mont Song right next to Luoyang City. The [[Yongning Pagoda|Yongning Temple]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6c38\u5b81\u5bfa}}), the tallest pagoda in China, was also built in Luoyang.\n\nWhen [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] took control in 604 AD he founded the new Luoyang on the site of the existing city using a layout inspired by his father [[Emperor Wen of Sui]]'s work in newly rebuilt Chang'an.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Robert B.|last=Marks|title=China: Its Environment and History|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXVHL2mYajAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=China:+Its+Environment+and+History&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QK3HUsPSBpKqhAfaooGABw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=emperor%20yang%20of%20sui&f=false|ISBN=1442212756}} p. 116</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Schinz|first=Alfred|year=1996|title=The Magic Square: Cities in Ancient China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhcRYkz-I3YC&pg=PA380&lpg=PA380&dq=The+Magic+Square:+Cities+in+Ancient+China&source=bl&ots=Y8DFplSi-a&sig=cjWM3YUsF7Pv7y5emD_3Kws5UgE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vKvHUoDUCcSBhAfTv4HIBw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=luoyang&f=false|ISBN=3930698021}} p. 167-169.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Tang dynasty]], Luoyang was Dongdu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e1c\u90fd}}), the \"Eastern Capital\", and at its height had a population of around one million, second only to Chang'an, which, at the time, was the largest city in the world.<ref>Abramson (2008), p. viii.</ref>\n\nAt the interval of Tang dynasty, the first and the only empress in Chinese history \u2013 [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], moved the capital of her Zhou Dynasty to Luoyang and named it as Shen Du (Capital of the God). She constructed the tallest palace in Chinese history, which is now in the site of Sui Tang Luoyang city. Luoyang was heavily damaged during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the short-lived Five Dynasties, Luoyang was the capital of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] (only for a few years before the court moved to [[Kaifeng]]) and [[Later Tang]].\n\nDuring the North [[Song dynasty]], Luoyang was the 'Western Capital' and birthplace of Zhao Kuangyin, the founder of the Song dynasty. It served as a prominent culture center, housing some of the most important philosophers. This prosperity was mainly caused by Luoyang undergoing new developments and reconstruction during this period.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], Luoyang was the \"Middle Capital\".\n\nSince the [[Yuan dynasty]], Luoyang was no longer the capital of China in the rest of the ancient dynasties. During the Yuan and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, Luoyang was razed and rebuilt twice. It's walls were destroyed by peasant rebels in the late Ming period. The city walls were then rebuilt during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasty.<ref name=\":0\" /> The population was reduced to that of an average county. However, for one last time, Luoyang city was the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] for a brief period of time during the Japanese invasion. By 1949, Luoyang's population was 75,000.\n\nAfter the People's Republic of China was established, Luoyang was revived as a major heavy industrial hub. In the [[first five-year plan (China)|first five-year plan of China]], 7 of 156 Soviet-aided major industrial programmes were launched in Luoyang's [[Jianxi District]], including Dongfanghong Tractor Factory, Luoyang Mining Machines Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory. Later, during the [[Third Front (China)|Third Front]] construction, a group of heavy industry factories was moved to or founded in Luoyang, including Luoyang Glass Factory.

It currently is the second-busiest single-runway airport in the United States, after [[San Diego International Airport]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Rob|title=Airport Questions Answered|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/uncategorized/airport-questions-answered/|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Voice of San Diego|date=20 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092549/http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/uncategorized/airport-questions-answered/|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>   In 2019, the airport served 10,225,180 passengers, the most in its history.\n\nThe airport sits on 13,555 acres (5,486 ha, 21.2 sq.mi.)<ref name=\"FAA\" /> of land just southeast of Fort Myers, making it the third-largest airport in the United States in terms of land size (after [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] and [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]]). 6,000 acres of the land has been conserved as swamp lands and set aside for [[environmental mitigation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida Transportation: Are We There Yet?|url=http://www.gulfshorelife.com/January-2014/Southwest-Florida-Transportation-Are-We-There-Yet/|website=Gulfshore Life|accessdate=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017231831/http://www.gulfshorelife.com/January-2014/Southwest-Florida-Transportation-Are-We-There-Yet/|archive-date=October 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPrior to the opening of the airport, the region was served by [[Page Field]] in Fort Myers.  By the 1970s, however, it had become clear that Page Field would be too small to handle increasing future demand for commercial flights into the region.  Expanding Page Field was determined to be impractical because its airfield was constrained by U.S. 41 to the west and expanding the airfield to the east would require bridging the [[Ten Mile Canal]] and relocating a railroad track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida Regional Airport Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_k0AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of sites were considered for a new regional airport, including southern [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]], [[Estero, Florida|Estero]], and northeast Cape Coral near [[Burnt Store Marina, Florida|Burnt Store Marina]].  The government of Lee County ultimately selected a site near the end of [[County Road 876 (Lee County, Florida)|Daniels Road]] which was a dirt road at the time.  An advantage to this location was its proximity to [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]], which was under construction and would have an interchange with Daniels Road, providing easy access (Interstate 75 was opened to traffic through Fort Myers in 1979).<ref>{{cite web|title=Interstate 75|url=http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|website=AA Roads|accessdate=28 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225161123/http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|archive-date=February 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the airport began in 1980, and it opened on schedule on May 14, 1983, with a single 8400-ft runway. At the time of its opening, the airport was named '''Southwest Florida Regional Airport''' (the airport code '''RSW''' is short for \"'''R'''egional '''S'''outh-'''W'''est\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Airport Codes-RSW|url=http://airportcod.es/#airport/rsw|website=Airport Codes|accessdate=22 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013074013/http://airportcod.es/#airport/rsw|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Delta Air Lines]] operated the first flight.  The original terminal was located on the north side of the runway at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nThe airport was renamed '''Southwest Florida International Airport''' in 1993, though it had hosted international flights since 1984 and U.S. Customs since 1987. The name change coincided with the completion of a 55,000 square foot Federal Inspection facility annexed to the original terminal's Concourse A.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Aviation in Lee County|url=http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|website=Southwest Florida International Airport|accessdate=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213624/http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The runway was also lengthened to 12,000&nbsp;ft (3,658 m) at the same time to better accommodate international service (making it the fourth-longest runway in Florida).<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida International Airport|url=http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016142025/http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 October 2015|website=Freight Moves Florida|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 the airport exceeded its annual capacity of 3 million passengers; by 2004, the airport was serving nearly 7 million passengers annually.  The original terminal had 17 gates on two concourses.  While three of the gates were added in a minor expansion of the B concourse in the late 1990s, the original terminal's design was not conducive to a major expansion.\n\nWith the terminal operating at more than double its intended capacity, construction of a new Midfield Terminal Complex began in February 2002. The $438 million terminal opened on September 9, 2005. The terminal, designed by Spillis Candela/[[AECOM|DMJM Aviation]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southeast.construction.com/features/archive/0411_Feature2.asp |title=Ready for Takeoff? |publisher=Southeast Construction |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221232035/http://southeast.construction.com/features/archive/0411_Feature2.asp |archive-date=February 21, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> has three concourses and 28 gates and can eventually expand to five concourses with 65 gates.  Demolition of the former terminal north of the airfield was completed in spring 2006.  However, the original terminal's parking lot and other related infrastructure still stand at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nIn early 2015, Terminal Access Road, the airport's main entrance road, was extended past Treeline Avenue to connect directly to Interstate 75, allowing airport-related traffic to avoid local streets. The airport can now be accessed directly from the freeway at Exit 128.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i75onthego.com/homeAirportDC.html |title=I-75onthego  -  I-75 Direct Connect |work=i75onthego.com |accessdate=June 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523183856/http://www.i75onthego.com/homeAirportDC.html |archivedate=May 23, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>  Terminal Access Road was then expanded to six lanes in late 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/1440.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911080543/http://flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/1440.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSince beginning commercial airline service on May 14, 1983 through the end of 2019, over 205.5 million passengers (enplaned and deplaned) have transited through RSW. There has been over 2.67 million aircraft operations at the airport since its opening.\n\n==Current and future projects==\nA new $16 million Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting facility (Lee County Station 92) opened in July 2013. A {{convert|9100|ft|m|abbr=on}} parallel runway is in planning. The project includes a relocated air traffic control tower, apron expansion, crossfield taxiway system, mitigation activities and FPL electrical line relocation. The new air traffic control tower and parallel runway were expected to be completed by 2019, however this has been pushed back to late 2020. The apron expansion and crossfield taxiway system were completed in late 2013. The entire project is estimated to cost $454 million.\n\nIn early 2018, the Lee County Port Authority (LCPA) announced plans to ease seasonal security wait times by expanding and relocating the current security checkpoints for each concourse. By relocating each checkpoint, there will be more restaurants, shops, and post-security spaces. According to the announcement by the LCPA, this expansion could cost between $150 million - $180 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news-press.com/story/news/2018/02/01/peak-season-checkpoint-waits-push-fort-myers-airport-toward-major-terminal-expansion/1042155001/ |title=Fort Myers airport to expand terminal, consolidate TSA screening to cut waits |publisher=News-press.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\nPlans are in place for Skyplex \u2013 a commercial and industrial park in the location of the old terminal.

By the 1970s, however, it had become clear that Page Field would be too small to handle increasing future demand for commercial flights into the region.  Expanding Page Field was determined to be impractical because its airfield was constrained by U.S. 41 to the west and expanding the airfield to the east would require bridging the [[Ten Mile Canal]] and relocating a railroad track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida Regional Airport Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_k0AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of sites were considered for a new regional airport, including southern [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]], [[Estero, Florida|Estero]], and northeast Cape Coral near [[Burnt Store Marina, Florida|Burnt Store Marina]].  The government of Lee County ultimately selected a site near the end of [[County Road 876 (Lee County, Florida)|Daniels Road]] which was a dirt road at the time.  An advantage to this location was its proximity to [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]], which was under construction and would have an interchange with Daniels Road, providing easy access (Interstate 75 was opened to traffic through Fort Myers in 1979).<ref>{{cite web|title=Interstate 75|url=http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|website=AA Roads|accessdate=28 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225161123/http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|archive-date=February 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the airport began in 1980, and it opened on schedule on May 14, 1983, with a single 8400-ft runway.

The original terminal was located on the north side of the runway at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nThe airport was renamed '''Southwest Florida International Airport''' in 1993, though it had hosted international flights since 1984 and U.S. Customs since 1987. The name change coincided with the completion of a 55,000 square foot Federal Inspection facility annexed to the original terminal's Concourse A.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Aviation in Lee County|url=http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|website=Southwest Florida International Airport|accessdate=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213624/http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The runway was also lengthened to 12,000&nbsp;ft (3,658 m) at the same time to better accommodate international service (making it the fourth-longest runway in Florida).<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida International Airport|url=http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016142025/http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 October 2015|website=Freight Moves Florida|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 the airport exceeded its annual capacity of 3 million passengers; by 2004, the airport was serving nearly 7 million passengers annually.  The original terminal had 17 gates on two concourses.  While three of the gates were added in a minor expansion of the B concourse in the late 1990s, the original terminal's design was not conducive to a major expansion.\n\nWith the terminal operating at more than double its intended capacity, construction of a new Midfield Terminal Complex began in February 2002.

Demolition of the former terminal north of the airfield was completed in spring 2006.  However, the original terminal's parking lot and other related infrastructure still stand at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nIn early 2015, Terminal Access Road, the airport's main entrance road, was extended past Treeline Avenue to connect directly to Interstate 75, allowing airport-related traffic to avoid local streets.

The new air traffic control tower and parallel runway were expected to be completed by 2019, however this has been pushed back to late 2020. The apron expansion and crossfield taxiway system were completed in late 2013. The entire project is estimated to cost $454 million.\n\nIn early 2018, the Lee County Port Authority (LCPA) announced plans to ease seasonal security wait times by expanding and relocating the current security checkpoints for each concourse. By relocating each checkpoint, there will be more restaurants, shops, and post-security spaces. According to the announcement by the LCPA, this expansion could cost between $150 million - $180 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news-press.com/story/news/2018/02/01/peak-season-checkpoint-waits-push-fort-myers-airport-toward-major-terminal-expansion/1042155001/ |title=Fort Myers airport to expand terminal, consolidate TSA screening to cut waits |publisher=News-press.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\nPlans are in place for Skyplex \u2013 a commercial and industrial park in the location of the old terminal.

{"title_page": "Hinds v. Brazealle", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''Hinds v. Brazealle''''' (1838) was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi]], which denied the legality in Mississippi of deeds of [[manumission]] executed by Elisha Brazealle, a Mississippi resident, in Ohio to free a slave woman and their son. Hinds ruled that Brazealle was trying to evade Mississippi law against manumissions except when authorized by the state legislature, and the actions were invalid. Both the mother and son were declared legally still slaves in Mississippi, and the son was prohibited from inheriting his father's estate, as Brazealle had left it all to him. \n\n==Background==\nIn 1826 Elisha Brazealle traveled from Mississippi to Ohio with a female slave and their [[mulatto]] son John Munroe Brazealle.  He intended to emancipate both the woman and his son and return with them to Mississippi. During their stay in Ohio, Elisha executed a deed of emancipation for the mother and son, and returned to his residence in [[Jefferson County, Mississippi]].  In his will, Elisha reiterated his execution of emancipation for the two and left all of his property to his son John Munroe Brazealle.  After his executors took charge of his estate, his relatives contested the will.  They claimed that John Munroe Brazealle was still a slave and that slaves could not inherit property.\n\n==Decision==\nChief Justice [[William L.

To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed [[James River bateau]]x above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, [[George Washington]] helped design the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] from [[Westham, Virginia|Westham]] east to Richmond, to bypass Richmond's rapids on the upper James River with the intent of providing a water route across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Kanawha River]] flowing westward into the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] then eventually to the [[Mississippi River]]. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag.

The temporary home of former General Robert E. Lee still stands on Franklin Street in downtown Richmond. The history of slavery and emancipation are also increasingly represented: there is a former slave trail along the river that leads to Ancarrow's Boat Ramp and Historic Site which has been developed with interpretive signage, and in 2007, the Reconciliation Statue was placed in Shockoe Bottom, with parallel statues placed in [[Liverpool]] and [[Benin]] representing points of the [[Triangle Trade]].\n\nOther historical points of interest include [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia|St. John's Church]], the site of [[Patrick Henry]]'s famous \"[[Give me liberty or give me death]]\" speech, and the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond)|Edgar Allan Poe Museum]], features many of his writings and other artifacts of his life, particularly when he lived in the city as a child, a student, and a successful writer.

From [[Lewis Hallam]]'s early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest,<ref>Macready, William, ''The diaries of William Charles Macready, 1833\u20131851, Volume 2'', p. 416</ref> and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day under the name Virginia Repertory Theatre.\n* [[Virginia Repertory Theatre]] is Central Virginia's largest professional theatre organization. It was created in 2012 when Barksdale Theatre and Theatre IV, which had shared one staff for over a decade, merged to become one company. With an annual budget of over $5 million, the theatre employs over 240 artists each year, presenting a season at the November Theatre and Theatre Gym at Virginia Rep Center, as well as productions at the Hanover Tavern and The Children's Theatre in The Shops at Willow Lawn. The historic November Theatre opened in 1911 as the Empire Theatre, offering stock and vaudeville performances. In 1915 it changed its name from the Empire to the Strand and continued under that name until damaged by fire in 1927. It reopened in 1933 as the \"Booker T,\" and served as the leading black movie house for many years when Richmond was segregated. It closed in 1974 and was idle until real estate developer Mitchell Kambis rescued and renovated it. Kambis restored the Empire name and in 1979 leased it to Keith Fowler, artistic director of the American Revels Company. Revels restored live professional theater to downtown Richmond. Revels was succeeded by Theatre IV in 1984. On its 100th anniversary in 2011 the theatre was further restored when Sara Belle and Neil November made a $2 million gift to Theatre IV and Barksdale.[1] The November now serves as Virginia Rep's headquarters and home and anchors the Arts District. It is currently under the leadership of Artistic Director Bruce Miller and Managing Director Phil Whiteway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/03/know-a-theatre-virginia-repertory-theatre-of-richmond-va/ |title=Know a Theatre: Virginia Repertory Theatre of Richmond, Va. |work=americantheatre.org |access-date=June 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923181446/http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/04/03/know-a-theatre-virginia-repertory-theatre-of-richmond-va/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Richmond Ballet]], founded in 1957.\n* [[Richmond Triangle Players]], founded in 1993, delivers theater programs exploring themes of equality, identity, affection and family across sexual orientation and gender spectrums.\n* [[Richmond Symphony]]\n* [[Virginia Opera]], the Official Opera Company of the Commonwealth of Virginia, founded in 1974.

The city's growth in population over the last decade has been concentrated in these areas.\n\nAmong Richmond's most interesting architectural features is its [[Cast-iron architecture]]. Second only to [[New Orleans]] in its concentration of cast iron work, the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports.<ref>Robert P. Winthrop, Cast and Wrought: The Architectural Metalwork of Richmond, Virginia, (Richmond, Virginia: Valentine Museum, 1980), 93.</ref> Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application.\n\nRichmond is home to several notable instances of various styles of modernism. [[Minoru Yamasaki]] designed the Federal Reserve Building which dominates the downtown skyline. The [[architectural firm]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] has designed two buildings: the [[Library of Virginia]] and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. [[Philip Johnson]] designed the [[WRVA Building]]. The [[Richard Neutra]]-designed [[Rice House (Richmond, Virginia)|Rice House]], a residence on a private island on the James River, remains Richmond's only true International Style home. The W.G. Harris residence in Richmond was designed by famed early modern architect and member of the [[Harvard Five]],<ref>\"The Harvard Five in New Canaan\", William D. Earls AIA, W. W Norton and Co., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-393-73183-5}}</ref> [[Landis Gores]]. The VCU [[Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond|Institute for Contemporary Art]], designed by [[Steven Holl]], opened in 2018. Other notable architects to have worked in the city include Rick Mather, [[I.M. Pei]], and [[Gordon Bunshaft]].\n\nMany of Richmond's historic properties were documented in books and 1970s era black and white photographs by [[John G. Zehmer]], an architectural historian and preservationist.\n\n===Historic districts===\n\nRichmond's City Code provides for the creation of old and historic districts so as to \"recognize and protect the historic, architectural, cultural, and artistic heritage of the City\".<ref>[https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.2PU City Code of Richmond, Virginia, Section 30-930.2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625033821/https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.2PU |date=June 25, 2016 }}.</ref> Pursuant to that authority, the city has designated 45 districts throughout the city.<ref>[https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.5ESPAOLHIDI City Code of Richmond, Virginia, Section 30-930.5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625034925/https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.5ESPAOLHIDI |date=June 25, 2016 }}.</ref> The majority of these districts are also listed in the [[Virginia Landmarks Register]] (\"VLR\") and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (\"NRHP\").\n\nFifteen of the districts represent broad sections of the city:<ref>Detailed descriptions of these districts are provided by the city in [http://www.richmondgov.com/CommissionArchitecturalReview/documents/Old_Historic_Dist.pdf Old & Historic Districts of Richmond, Virginia, Handbook and Design Review Guidelines (1st Edition, December, 2006, updated January, 2015), p. 11] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100203/http://www.richmondgov.com/CommissionArchitecturalReview/documents/Old_Historic_Dist.pdf |date=October 17, 2016 }}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Belle Isle, at various former times a Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two, and contains many bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for [[rock climbing]] instruction. One can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the Civil War prison camp, such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that was used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is a smaller island and a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals in the spring and summer, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series or the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.\n\n[[File:MaymontPark JapaneseGarden.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese Garden at [[Maymont]]]]\nTwo other major parks in the city along the river are [[Byrd Park]] and [[Maymont]], located near the Fan District.

Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to 4 years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.\n\nIn 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of [[Curtis Holt Jr.]] who had claimed the council's existing election process&nbsp;\u2014 an at large voting system&nbsp;\u2014 was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black mayor, [[Henry L. Marsh]].\n\nIn 1990 religion and politics intersected to impact the outcome of the Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond.\n\nRichmond's government changed in 2004 from a [[council-manager]] form of government to an at-large, popularly elected Mayor. In a landslide election, incumbent mayor Rudy McCollum was defeated by [[L. Douglas Wilder]], who previously served Virginia as the first elected African American governor in the United States since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The current mayor of Richmond is [[Levar Stoney]] who was elected in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richmond City Government|url=http://www.richmondgov.com/Mayor/index.aspx|accessdate=January 30, 2017|ref=Richmond City Site|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129072427/http://www.richmondgov.com/Mayor/index.aspx|archive-date=January 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The mayor is not a part of the Richmond City Council.\n\n{{As of|2017|df=US}}, the Richmond City Council consisted of:\n* Chris A.

The [[Jackson Ward]] neighborhood is a traditional hub of [[African-American]] commerce and culture.\n\nRichmond's economy is primarily driven by law, finance, and government, with federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as notable legal and banking firms in the [[Downtown Richmond, Virginia|downtown area]].

To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed [[James River bateau]]x above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, [[George Washington]] helped design the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] from [[Westham, Virginia|Westham]] east to Richmond, to bypass Richmond's rapids on the upper James River with the intent of providing a water route across the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Kanawha River]] flowing westward into the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] then eventually to the [[Mississippi River]]. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to [[hydropower]] due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the country's largest manufacturing facilities, including iron works and flour mills, the largest of their kind in [[Southeastern United States|the South]].

The [[Seven Days Battles]] followed in late June and early July 1862, during which commanding Union General-in-Chief [[George B. McClellan]] threatened to take Richmond in the [[Peninsula campaign]] but failed.\n\nThree years later, in March 1865, Richmond became indefensible after nearby [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken. On March 25 Confederate General [[John B. Gordon]]'s desperate attack on [[Battle of Fort Stedman|Fort Stedman]] east of Petersburg failed. On April 1 Federal Cavalry General [[Philip Sheridan]], assigned to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by Southern General [[George Pickett]] at the [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]] junction, smashing them, taking thousands of prisoners, and encouraging Union General-in-Chief [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to order a general advance. When the Union Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on the Boydton Plank Road south of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5,000, about a tenth of Lee's defending army. Lee then informed President [[Jefferson Davis]] that he was about to evacuate Richmond.<ref>Levine pp. 271\u201372</ref>\n\nDavis and his cabinet, along with the government archives and Treasury gold, left the city by train that night, as government officials burned documents and departing Confederate troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny their contents to the victors.

After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered Weitzel to prevent the former Confederate state legislature from meeting. Union forces killed, wounded or captured 8,000 Confederate troops at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]] southwest of Petersburg on April 6, as the Southerners continued a general retreat southwestward.

From [[Lewis Hallam]]'s early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest,<ref>Macready, William, ''The diaries of William Charles Macready, 1833\u20131851, Volume 2'', p. 416</ref> and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day under the name Virginia Repertory Theatre.\n* [[Virginia Repertory Theatre]] is Central Virginia's largest professional theatre organization. It was created in 2012 when Barksdale Theatre and Theatre IV, which had shared one staff for over a decade, merged to become one company. With an annual budget of over $5 million, the theatre employs over 240 artists each year, presenting a season at the November Theatre and Theatre Gym at Virginia Rep Center, as well as productions at the Hanover Tavern and The Children's Theatre in The Shops at Willow Lawn. The historic November Theatre opened in 1911 as the Empire Theatre, offering stock and vaudeville performances. In 1915 it changed its name from the Empire to the Strand and continued under that name until damaged by fire in 1927. It reopened in 1933 as the \"Booker T,\" and served as the leading black movie house for many years when Richmond was segregated. It closed in 1974 and was idle until real estate developer Mitchell Kambis rescued and renovated it. Kambis restored the Empire name and in 1979 leased it to Keith Fowler, artistic director of the American Revels Company. Revels restored live professional theater to downtown Richmond.

The city contains diverse styles, including significant examples of Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, Egyptian Revival, Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Tudor Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Modernist, International, and Postmodern buildings.\n\nMuch of Richmond's early architecture was destroyed by the Evacuation Fire in 1865. It is estimated that 25% of all buildings in Richmond were destroyed during this fire.<ref>Hansen, Harry. \"The Civil War: A History.\" Published 2002, Signet Classic. {{ISBN|978-0-451-52849-0}}</ref> Even fewer now remain due to construction and [[urban renewal|demolition]] that has taken place since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In spite of this, Richmond contains many historically significant buildings and districts. Buildings remain from Richmond's colonial period, such as the [[Patteson-Schutte House]] and the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia)]], both built before 1750.\n\n[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|right|[[Egyptian Building]] of the VCU School of Medicine (1845)]]\nArchitectural classicism is heavily represented in all districts of the city, particularly in Downtown, the Fan, and the Museum District. Several notable classical architects have designed buildings in Richmond. The Virginia State Capitol was designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] in 1785. It is the second-oldest US statehouse in continuous use (after Maryland's) and was the first US government building built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style of architecture, setting the trend for other state houses and the federal government buildings (including the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|The Capitol]]) in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"jefferson_capital\">\"[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ Jefferson & The Capital Of Virginia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115150112/http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/capitol/ |date=January 15, 2010 }}.\" An Exhibition at the [[Library of Virginia]]; January 7&nbsp;\u2013 June 15, 2002.

Broad Street Station (or Union Station), designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style, is no longer a functioning station but is now home to the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. [[Main Street Station (Richmond)|Main Street Station]], designed by Wilson, Harris, and Richards, has been returned to use in its original purpose. The Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club were both designed by the classically trained Beaux-Arts architects Carr\u00e8re and Hastings. Many buildings on the [[University of Richmond]] campus, including Jeter Hall and Ryland Hall, were designed by [[Ralph Adams Cram]], most famous for his Princeton University Chapel and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.\n\nRichmond's urban residential neighborhoods also hold particular significance to the city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely single use town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's growth in population over the last decade has been concentrated in these areas.\n\nAmong Richmond's most interesting architectural features is its [[Cast-iron architecture]]. Second only to [[New Orleans]] in its concentration of cast iron work, the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports.<ref>Robert P. Winthrop, Cast and Wrought: The Architectural Metalwork of Richmond, Virginia, (Richmond, Virginia: Valentine Museum, 1980), 93.</ref> Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application.\n\nRichmond is home to several notable instances of various styles of modernism. [[Minoru Yamasaki]] designed the Federal Reserve Building which dominates the downtown skyline. The [[architectural firm]] of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] has designed two buildings: the [[Library of Virginia]] and the General Assembly Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. [[Philip Johnson]] designed the [[WRVA Building]]. The [[Richard Neutra]]-designed [[Rice House (Richmond, Virginia)|Rice House]], a residence on a private island on the James River, remains Richmond's only true International Style home. The W.G. Harris residence in Richmond was designed by famed early modern architect and member of the [[Harvard Five]],<ref>\"The Harvard Five in New Canaan\", William D. Earls AIA, W. W Norton and Co., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-393-73183-5}}</ref> [[Landis Gores]]. The VCU [[Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond|Institute for Contemporary Art]], designed by [[Steven Holl]], opened in 2018. Other notable architects to have worked in the city include Rick Mather, [[I.M. Pei]], and [[Gordon Bunshaft]].\n\nMany of Richmond's historic properties were documented in books and 1970s era black and white photographs by [[John G. Zehmer]], an architectural historian and preservationist.\n\n===Historic districts===\n\nRichmond's City Code provides for the creation of old and historic districts so as to \"recognize and protect the historic, architectural, cultural, and artistic heritage of the City\".<ref>[https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.2PU City Code of Richmond, Virginia, Section 30-930.2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625033821/https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.2PU |date=June 25, 2016 }}.</ref> Pursuant to that authority, the city has designated 45 districts throughout the city.<ref>[https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.5ESPAOLHIDI City Code of Richmond, Virginia, Section 30-930.5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625034925/https://www2.municode.com/library/va/richmond/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CORIVI_CH30ZO_ARTIXOVDI_DIV4OLHIDI_S30-930.5ESPAOLHIDI |date=June 25, 2016 }}.</ref> The majority of these districts are also listed in the [[Virginia Landmarks Register]] (\"VLR\") and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (\"NRHP\").\n\nFifteen of the districts represent broad sections of the city:<ref>Detailed descriptions of these districts are provided by the city in [http://www.richmondgov.com/CommissionArchitecturalReview/documents/Old_Historic_Dist.pdf Old & Historic Districts of Richmond, Virginia, Handbook and Design Review Guidelines (1st Edition, December, 2006, updated January, 2015), p. 11] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100203/http://www.richmondgov.com/CommissionArchitecturalReview/documents/Old_Historic_Dist.pdf |date=October 17, 2016 }}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The park system began when the city council voted in 1851 to acquire {{convert|7.5|acre|m2}}, now known as [[Monroe Park]]. Today, Monroe Park sits adjacent to the [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] campus and is one of more than 40 parks comprising a total of more than {{convert|1500|acre|ha}}.\n\nSeveral parks are located along the James River, and the James River Parks System offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks along the river's route through the city.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | title = James River Park System Mountain Biking Trails | website = Trailforks | access-date = August 26, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002242/https://www.trailforks.com/region/james-river-park-system/ | archive-date = September 22, 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref> The trails are used as part of the Xterra East Championship course for both the running and mountain biking portions of the off-road triathlon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html|title=XTERRA East Championship|author=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=November 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923213653/http://www.richmond.com/news/collection_3ecf827a-1206-11e5-a0d2-5fdcb6ba3682.html|archive-date=September 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are also parks on two major islands in the river: [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]] and Brown's Island. Belle Isle, at various former times a Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two, and contains many bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for [[rock climbing]] instruction. One can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the Civil War prison camp, such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that was used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is a smaller island and a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals in the spring and summer, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series or the James River Beer and Seafood Festival.\n\n[[File:MaymontPark JapaneseGarden.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese Garden at [[Maymont]]]]\nTwo other major parks in the city along the river are [[Byrd Park]] and [[Maymont]], located near the Fan District. Byrd Park features a {{convert|1|mi|spell=in|adj=on}} running track, with exercise stops, a public [[dog park]], and a number of small lakes for small boats, as well as two monuments, Buddha house, and an amphitheatre. Prominently featured in the park is the [[Carillon|World War I Memorial Carillon]], built in 1926 as a memorial to those that died in the war. Maymont, located adjacent to Byrd Park, is a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] estate with a museum, formal gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, [[carriage]] collection, and children's farm. Other parks in the city include [[Joseph Bryan Park Azalea Garden]], Forest Hill Park (former site of the Forest Hill Amusement Park), [[Chimborazo Park]] (site of the National Battlefield Headquarters), among others.\n\nThe James River itself through Richmond is renowned as one of the best in the country for urban white-water rafting/canoeing/kayaking. Several rafting companies offer complete services. There are also several easily accessed riverside areas within the city limits for rock-hopping, swimming, and picnicking.\n\n[[Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden]] is located adjacent to the city in Henrico County. Founded in 1984, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is located on {{convert|80|acre|m2}} and features a glass conservatory, a rose garden, a healing garden, and an accessible-to-all children's garden. The Garden is a public place for the display and scientific study of plants.

Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election Council terms was lengthened to 4 years. The city council elects from among its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every month, except August.\n\nIn 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor of [[Curtis Holt Jr.]] who had claimed the council's existing election process&nbsp;\u2014 an at large voting system&nbsp;\u2014 was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black mayor, [[Henry L. Marsh]].\n\nIn 1990 religion and politics intersected to impact the outcome of the Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond.\n\nRichmond's government changed in 2004 from a [[council-manager]] form of government to an at-large, popularly elected Mayor.

It was founded in 1787 by John Willis, an officer in the [[American Revolution]]. This was developed as a shipping point for [[lumber]] used by the Navy, and logs were guided downriver to [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[South Carolina]]. Most of the town's growth took place after [[World War II]].<!-- why? -->\n\n==History==\nThe City of Lumberton was created by an Act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] in 1787 and it was named the county seat of [[Robeson County]]. Lumberton was incorporated in 1859.\n\n[[Robeson County, North Carolina|Robeson County]] is located in the Coastal Plains region of southeastern [[North Carolina]]. The county was created from [[Bladen County]] in 1786 by two [[American Revolutionary War]] heroes and residents of the area, General John Willis and Colonel [[Thomas Robeson]]. The county was named after Colonel Robeson and the land for the county seat was donated by General Willis, who is credited with naming the county seat as Lumberton.\n\nThe area was a frontier destination for both white and numerous [[free people of color|free families of color]] from Virginia in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Many free blacks were descendants of white women (who were free) and African men, whether slave, free or indentured, from the colonial years, when working classes lived and worked near each other.<ref>Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', Baltimore, Maryland: 1995-2005</ref> The County has a high proportion of residents who identify as [[Lumbee]]: they have been recognized as a Native American tribe both by the state of North Carolina and the Federal government; however, they do not receive federal benefits (money) because no known treaty (contract) exists between Lumbee Indians and the US government that would entitle them to federal benefits according to Dr. Ben Chavis. In short, the Lumbee Indians were never defeated in a war or removed from their land by the United States government.\n\nFor four seasons, 1947\u201350, Lumberton fielded a professional minor league baseball team in the [[Tobacco State League]].

Most of the town's growth took place after [[World War II]].<!-- why? -->\n\n==History==\nThe City of Lumberton was created by an Act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] in 1787 and it was named the county seat of [[Robeson County]]. Lumberton was incorporated in 1859.\n\n[[Robeson County, North Carolina|Robeson County]] is located in the Coastal Plains region of southeastern [[North Carolina]]. The county was created from [[Bladen County]] in 1786 by two [[American Revolutionary War]] heroes and residents of the area, General John Willis and Colonel [[Thomas Robeson]]. The county was named after Colonel Robeson and the land for the county seat was donated by General Willis, who is credited with naming the county seat as Lumberton.\n\nThe area was a frontier destination for both white and numerous [[free people of color|free families of color]] from Virginia in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Many free blacks were descendants of white women (who were free) and African men, whether slave, free or indentured, from the colonial years, when working classes lived and worked near each other.<ref>Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', Baltimore, Maryland: 1995-2005</ref> The County has a high proportion of residents who identify as [[Lumbee]]: they have been recognized as a Native American tribe both by the state of North Carolina and the Federal government; however, they do not receive federal benefits (money) because no known treaty (contract) exists between Lumbee Indians and the US government that would entitle them to federal benefits according to Dr. Ben Chavis. In short, the Lumbee Indians were never defeated in a war or removed from their land by the United States government.\n\nFor four seasons, 1947\u201350, Lumberton fielded a professional minor league baseball team in the [[Tobacco State League]].

Contempt of the law by the [[cowboy]]s helped Luling become known as the \"toughest town in Texas\". After the great cattle drives ended in the late 1880s, Luling quieted down to a town of about 500 and cotton ruled the local economy. Perhaps due to arrival of immigrants, including [[History of the Jews in Texas|a sizeable Jewish population]],{{Explain|date=September 2018}} in the late-19th century, Luling began a long, slow, period of growth, and by 1925 the population reached 1,500.<ref name=\"Ency Southern Jewish Communities\">{{cite web| title=Luling, TX| url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/luling.html| work=Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities| accessdate=14 March 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314170516/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/luling.html| archive-date=14 March 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most significant events in Luling's history was the discovery of oil by Edgar B. Davis.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook 2\" />  Davis mortgaged everything he owned to finance drilling operations around Luling. On August 9, 1922, the Rafael Rios No. 1 well struck oil at {{convert|2161|ft|m}}, producing {{convert|150|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. To repay his loans, Davis contracted {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3}} each to Atlantic Oil and Magnolia Oil at $.50 a barrel, plus another {{convert|2|Moilbbl|m3}} to Magnolia at $.75 per barrel.<ref name=\"Handbook of Texas\">{{cite web| title=Davis, Edgar Byram| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fda36| work=Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nDavis' discovery opened up an oilfield {{convert|12|mi}} long and {{convert|2|mi|0}} wide. The economy quickly moved from the railroad and agriculture to oil. The population of the town rapidly increased to over 5,000.
