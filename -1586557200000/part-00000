The NES restarted the [[video game industry]] after the [[video game crash of 1983]], and was an international success. In 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers. In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) was a strong seller, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was a very strong contender. Nintendo and [[Sega]] would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular console, beating the [[Nintendo 64]], though Nintendo managed to sell more than [[Sega Saturn]].\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]], released in 1999, [[PlayStation 2]], released in 2000, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the [[GameCube]]. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen ([[Nintendo DS|DS]]) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the [[Wii]]); they became some of the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling consoles]] of all time. In 2010, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with [[stereoscopic 3D]] capabilities, with the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]], which had very strong sales from the beginning. The [[Wii U]], released in 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted.

In Japan, it is known as the \"Family Computer\" (or \"Famicom\", as it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]''<!-- NOT the Mario series, which was started in arcades in Donkey Kong, and not Kirby, which was started on the GameBoy --> were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/16/news102.html|script-title=ja:\u521d\u4ee3\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u300d\u306a\u3069\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u7406\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86|accessdate=January 20, 2008|author=|date=October 16, 2007|work=ITmedia News|publisher=ITmedia|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |title=Nintendo of Japan dropping Hardware support for the Famicom |accessdate=January 20, 2008 |author=RyanDG |date=October 16, 2007 |publisher=Arcade Renaissance |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317164110/http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |archivedate=March 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nintendo's classic Famicom faces end of road |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |format=Reprint |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105193128/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |archivedate=November 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nNintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

The bottom screen is a touch screen comparable to the DS bottom screens, and the top screen is Wide Screen and an autostereoscopic 3D LCD. ''[[Autostereoscopy]]'' is a process that sends different images to the left and right eyes to enable the viewer to view the screen in 3D \"without the need for special glasses\". The 3DS is said to enhance Nintendo's online experience. In 2012, the 3DS XL was released, similar to the change between the DSi and DSi XL. It has 90% larger screens and design changes such as a matte finish and the stylus in a more accessible area.\nThe [[Nintendo 2DS|2DS]] was released on October 12, 2013.

It includes a C-Stick, ZR and ZL shoulder buttons, and a faster CPU, allowing for more software specifically for the New Nintendo 3DS (such as ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 3D]]'').

The NES restarted the [[video game industry]] after the [[video game crash of 1983]], and was an international success. In 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers. In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) was a strong seller, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was a very strong contender. Nintendo and [[Sega]] would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular console, beating the [[Nintendo 64]], though Nintendo managed to sell more than [[Sega Saturn]].\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]], released in 1999, [[PlayStation 2]], released in 2000, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the [[GameCube]]. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen ([[Nintendo DS|DS]]) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the [[Wii]]); they became some of the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling consoles]] of all time. In 2010, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with [[stereoscopic 3D]] capabilities, with the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]], which had very strong sales from the beginning. The [[Wii U]], released in 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted.

Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.

The system was code-named \"Nintendo NX\" prior to its official announcement. It is a hybrid device that can be used as a home console inserted to the Nintendo Switch Dock attached to a television, stood up on a table with the kickstand, or as a tablet-like portable console. It features two detachable wireless controllers called Joy-Con, that can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a more traditional game pad form. Both Joy-Con are built with motion sensors and HD Rumble, Nintendo's haptic vibration feedback system for improved gameplay experiences. However, only the right Joy-Con has an NFC reader on its analog joystick for [[Amiibo]] and an IR sensor on the back.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

The bottom screen is a touch screen comparable to the DS bottom screens, and the top screen is Wide Screen and an autostereoscopic 3D LCD. ''[[Autostereoscopy]]'' is a process that sends different images to the left and right eyes to enable the viewer to view the screen in 3D \"without the need for special glasses\". The 3DS is said to enhance Nintendo's online experience. In 2012, the 3DS XL was released, similar to the change between the DSi and DSi XL. It has 90% larger screens and design changes such as a matte finish and the stylus in a more accessible area.\nThe [[Nintendo 2DS|2DS]] was released on October 12, 2013. It is a variant designed to be affordable without the clamshell design or 3D capabilities of the 3DS.

It includes a C-Stick, ZR and ZL shoulder buttons, and a faster CPU, allowing for more software specifically for the New Nintendo 3DS (such as ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 3D]]''). Like the original 3DS, the New Nintendo 3DS also has an XL form.\nAs of December 31, 2013, Nintendo has sold 42.74 million units, including 15.21 million Nintendo 3DS XLs and 2.11 million Nintendo 2DS units.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nThe latest handheld console was the [[New Nintendo 2DS XL]], which was released in July 2017 across five different countries and is the only model still in production.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo Switch ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Switch}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-wJoyCons-BlRd-Standing-FL.jpg|thumb|left|The Nintendo Switch]]\nThe Nintendo Switch is a hybrid home and portable console.
