He was born in [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]], and is best known as a member of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] who pioneered a distinctly Canadian painting style in the early twentieth century. [[A.&nbsp;Y. Jackson]] has been quoted as saying that Harris provided the stimulus for the Group of Seven. During the 1920s, Harris' works became more abstract and simplified, especially his stark landscapes of the Canadian north and [[Arctic]]. He also stopped signing and dating his works so that people would judge his works on their own merit and not by the [[artist]] or when they were painted. In 1969, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].\n\n==Life==\n===Early years===\nLawren Stewart Harris was born on October 23, 1885 in [[Brantford (ON)|Brantford]], [[Ontario]]. The son of Thomas Morgan Harris and Anna Stewart, Harris was an heir to the [[Massey-Harris]] fortune.<ref name=\"OHS\">{{cite web|title=Lawren Harris (1885-1910)|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Lawren-Harris-ENG.pdf|publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Murray\">{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Joan|title=Lawren Harris|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lawren-stewart-harris/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> The wealth and status of the family afforded Harris a privileged youth, which allowed him to focus on his painting career.<ref name=\"McMichaelBio\">{{cite web|title=Lawren S. Harris (1885-1970)|url=https://www.mcmichael.com/collection/seven/harris.cfm|website=www.mcmichael.com|publisher=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> He attended [[Central Technical School]] and [[St. Andrew's College (Aurora, Ontario)|St. Andrew's College]]. From age 19 (1904 to 1908) he studied in [[Berlin]]. He was interested in [[philosophy]] and Eastern thought. Later, he became involved in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and joined the Toronto Lodge of the International Theosophical Society. Lawren went on to marry Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips on January 20, 1910, and together had three children ([[Lawren P. Harris]], Margaret Anne Harris, Howard K. Harris) born in the first decade of their marriage. Soon after meeting and becoming friends with [[J. E. H. MacDonald]] in 1911, they together formed the famous Group of Seven. He financed the construction of a studio building in Toronto with friend [[James MacCallum]]. The studio provided artists with cheap or free space where they worked.\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Group-of-seven-artists.jpg|thumb|left|Group of seven artists: [[Frederick Varley]], [[A. Y. Jackson]], Lawren Harris, [[Barker Fairley]], [[Frank Johnston (artist)]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[J. E. H. MacDonald]]]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lawren Harris - North Shore, Lake Superior.jpg|thumb|left|''North Shore, Lake Superior'', 1926]] -->\n[[File:Lawren Harris in his Vancouver Studio.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lawren Harris in his Vancouver studio, circa 1944.]]\nIn 1918 and 1919, Harris financed [[boxcar]] trips for the artists of the Group of Seven to the [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] region, travelling along the Algoma Central Railway and painting in areas such as the Montreal River and Agawa Canyon. In the fall of 1921, Harris ventured beyond Algoma to [[Lake Superior]]'s North Shore, where he would return annually for the next seven years. While his Algoma and urban paintings of the late 1910s and early 1920s were characterized by rich, bright colours and decorative composition motifs, the discovery of Lake Superior subject material catalyzed a transition to a more austere, simplified style, with limited palettes - often jewel colours with a range of neutral tones. In 1924, a sketching trip with A.Y. Jackson to [[Jasper National Park]] in the Canadian [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] marked the beginning of Harris' mountain subjects, which he continued to explore with annual sketching trips until 1929, exploring areas around [[Banff National Park]], [[Yoho National Park]] and [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]]. In 1930, Harris went on his last extended sketching trip, travelling to the Arctic aboard the supply ship SS. Beothic for two months, during which time he completed over 50 sketches. The resulting Arctic canvases that he developed from the oil panels marked the end of his landscape period, and from 1935 on, Harris enthusiastically embraced abstract painting.\nAfter the disbanding of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] in 1933, Harris and the other surviving members including [[A. J. Casson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], [[A. Y. Jackson]], and [[Franklin Carmichael]], were instrumental in forming its successor, the larger national group, the [[Canadian Group of Painters]].\n\n===Personal life===\nOn January 20, 1910, Harris married Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips. The couple had three children. Harris later fell in love with [[Bess Larkin Housser Harris|Bess]], the wife of his school-time friend, F.B. Housser. Harris and Bess fell in love, but saw no way forward. For the two to divorce their spouses and marry would cause an outrage.\n\nHarris eventually left his wife of 24 years, Trixie, and his three children, and married Bess Housser in 1934. He was threatened with charges of [[bigamy]] by Trixie\u2019s family because of his actions. Later that year he and Bess left their home and moved to the United States. In 1940 they moved to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], where Harris entered his [[abstract art|abstract]] phase. Bess died in 2020.\n\nI like Malachi Barton boom!\n\n==Media==\n\nIn 2016 a film about Harris's life, ''Where the Universe Sings'', was produced by [[TV Ontario]].  It was created by filmmaker [[Peter Raymont]] and directed by Nancy Lang.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2016/06/25/lawren-harris-film-captures-acclaimed-painters-life-and-times.html \"Lawren Harris film captures acclaimed painter\u2019s life and times\"].

He was born in [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]], and is best known as a member of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] who pioneered a distinctly Canadian painting style in the early twentieth century. [[A.&nbsp;Y. Jackson]] has been quoted as saying that Harris provided the stimulus for the Group of Seven. During the 1920s, Harris' works became more abstract and simplified, especially his stark landscapes of the Canadian north and [[Arctic]]. He also stopped signing and dating his works so that people would judge his works on their own merit and not by the [[artist]] or when they were painted. In 1969, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].\n\n==Life==\n===Early years===\nLawren Stewart Harris was born on October 23, 1885 in [[Brantford (ON)|Brantford]], [[Ontario]]. The son of Thomas Morgan Harris and Anna Stewart, Harris was an heir to the [[Massey-Harris]] fortune.<ref name=\"OHS\">{{cite web|title=Lawren Harris (1885-1910)|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Lawren-Harris-ENG.pdf|publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Murray\">{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Joan|title=Lawren Harris|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lawren-stewart-harris/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> The wealth and status of the family afforded Harris a privileged youth, which allowed him to focus on his painting career.<ref name=\"McMichaelBio\">{{cite web|title=Lawren S. Harris (1885-1970)|url=https://www.mcmichael.com/collection/seven/harris.cfm|website=www.mcmichael.com|publisher=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> He attended [[Central Technical School]] and [[St. Andrew's College (Aurora, Ontario)|St. Andrew's College]]. From age 19 (1904 to 1908) he studied in [[Berlin]]. He was interested in [[philosophy]] and Eastern thought. Later, he became involved in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and joined the Toronto Lodge of the International Theosophical Society. Lawren went on to marry Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips on January 20, 1910, and together had three children ([[Lawren P. Harris]], Margaret Anne Harris, Howard K. Harris) born in the first decade of their marriage. Soon after meeting and becoming friends with [[J. E. H. MacDonald]] in 1911, they together formed the famous Group of Seven. He financed the construction of a studio building in Toronto with friend [[James MacCallum]]. The studio provided artists with cheap or free space where they worked.\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Group-of-seven-artists.jpg|thumb|left|Group of seven artists: [[Frederick Varley]], [[A. Y. Jackson]], Lawren Harris, [[Barker Fairley]], [[Frank Johnston (artist)]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[J. E. H. MacDonald]]]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lawren Harris - North Shore, Lake Superior.jpg|thumb|left|''North Shore, Lake Superior'', 1926]] -->\n[[File:Lawren Harris in his Vancouver Studio.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lawren Harris in his Vancouver studio, circa 1944.]]\nIn 1918 and 1919, Harris financed [[boxcar]] trips for the artists of the Group of Seven to the [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] region, travelling along the Algoma Central Railway and painting in areas such as the Montreal River and Agawa Canyon. In the fall of 1921, Harris ventured beyond Algoma to [[Lake Superior]]'s North Shore, where he would return annually for the next seven years. While his Algoma and urban paintings of the late 1910s and early 1920s were characterized by rich, bright colours and decorative composition motifs, the discovery of Lake Superior subject material catalyzed a transition to a more austere, simplified style, with limited palettes - often jewel colours with a range of neutral tones. In 1924, a sketching trip with A.Y. Jackson to [[Jasper National Park]] in the Canadian [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] marked the beginning of Harris' mountain subjects, which he continued to explore with annual sketching trips until 1929, exploring areas around [[Banff National Park]], [[Yoho National Park]] and [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]]. In 1930, Harris went on his last extended sketching trip, travelling to the Arctic aboard the supply ship SS. Beothic for two months, during which time he completed over 50 sketches. The resulting Arctic canvases that he developed from the oil panels marked the end of his landscape period, and from 1935 on, Harris enthusiastically embraced abstract painting.\nAfter the disbanding of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] in 1933, Harris and the other surviving members including [[A. J. Casson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], [[A. Y. Jackson]], and [[Franklin Carmichael]], were instrumental in forming its successor, the larger national group, the [[Canadian Group of Painters]].\n\n===Personal life===\nOn January 20, 1910, Harris married Beatrice (Trixie) Phillips. The couple had three children. Harris later fell in love with [[Bess Larkin Housser Harris|Bess]], the wife of his school-time friend, F.B. Housser. Harris and Bess fell in love, but saw no way forward. For the two to divorce their spouses and marry would cause an outrage.\n\nHarris eventually left his wife of 24 years, Trixie, and his three children, and married Bess Housser in 1934. He was threatened with charges of [[bigamy]] by Trixie\u2019s family because of his actions. Later that year he and Bess left their home and moved to the United States. In 1940 they moved to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], where Harris entered his [[abstract art|abstract]] phase. Bess died in 1969.\n\n===Death===\nHarris died in Vancouver in 1970, at the age of 84, as a well-known artist. He was buried on the grounds of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, where his work is now held.\n\n==Media==\n\nIn 2016 a film about Harris's life, ''Where the Universe Sings'', was produced by [[TV Ontario]].  It was created by filmmaker [[Peter Raymont]] and directed by Nancy Lang.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2016/06/25/lawren-harris-film-captures-acclaimed-painters-life-and-times.html \"Lawren Harris film captures acclaimed painter\u2019s life and times\"].

The band has released eleven [[studio album]]s, one [[live album]], one [[compilation album]], two [[extended play|EP]]s and twenty-four [[Single (music)|singles]].\n\n==History==\nDanzig traces its beginnings back to July 14, 1986, when [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] performed at [[Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in [[New York City]]. In attendance was [[Rick Rubin]], who was scouting for potential bands to sign to his record label, [[Def Jam]]. Upon viewing Samhain's performance, Rubin was impressed with Glenn Danzig's powerful stage persona and vocal abilities. He met him after the show and propositioned him. At first, he wished only to sign Danzig, with the intent of making him the vocalist for a hard rock [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] that Rubin envisioned. However, Danzig refused to sign to Rubin's label without Samhain's bassist, [[Eerie Von]], with whom Danzig had become great friends. Rubin agreed to sign Samhain, and he began making suggestions for the new direction he felt the band should take. Rubin felt the music should be stripped down, and that Danzig's vocal talents should become the focal point for the band.\n\nIn 1987, the band evolved into a solid hard rock act, with the addition of [[John Christ]] on guitar and [[Chuck Biscuits]] on drums. To reflect the change in musical direction, and to avoid having to ever start anew in the event of future lineup changes, Danzig decided to change the name of Samhain to his own surname, Danzig. In 1988, the band issued its eponymous [[Danzig (album)|first album]] on Rubin's then-new label [[Def American]] (later renamed to [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]). The album featured polished production by Rubin, with heavy, blues-based guitar riffs and Danzig's powerful and melodic vocal performance\u2014a harsh contrast to the gritty, raw-sounding production of Samhain's albums. Two years later, Danzig released their second album ''[[Danzig II: Lucifuge|Lucifuge]]''.\n\nBy 1992, Rubin's involvement with the band had waned and Danzig himself took credit for co-producing the third album, ''[[Danzig III: How the Gods Kill]]''. In May 1993, the band released the ''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]'' EP, which contained several live tracks from the band's 1992 Halloween show, as well as three new studio tracks. The EP provided a hit for the band when the live version of \"Mother\" (a song from the first Danzig album) became popular on hard rock radio stations. A new version of the \"Mother\" music video was created using live footage, and the video became a hit on [[MTV]] as well, pushing Danzig into the mainstream. After an October 4, 1994 show in the [[Whisky A Go-Go]], [[Los Angeles]], the band received two [[RIAA certification|gold award]]s for an excess of 500,000 units sold both for their debut album and ''Thrall/Demosweatlive''.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, Danzig issued their [[Danzig 4|fourth album]], which was also successful and spawned the singles \"Until You Call on the Dark\" and \"Cantspeak\". However, shortly before the release of that album, Biscuits left the band and was replaced by future [[Queens of the Stone Age]] drummer [[Joey Castillo]].\n\nIn 1995, Danzig began to fall apart when Christ and Eerie Von decided to quit the group, leaving Glenn the only remaining original member. Many lineup changes happened since and Danzig released six more albums: ''[[Blackacidevil]]'' (1996), ''[[6:66 Satan's Child|Satan's Child]]'' (1999), ''[[I Luciferi]]'' (2002), ''[[Circle of Snakes]]'' (2004) and ''[[Deth Red Sabaoth]]'' (2010). As of February 2014, Danzig is working on a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/danzig-recording-new-material/ |title=Danzig Recording New Music |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref>\n\nDanzig also recorded the song \"Black Hell\" for the soundtrack to the 2011 film ''[[The Hangover Part II]]''.\n\nDanzig's commented on record singles and the band's approach to releasing singles in America: \"Singles? We don't do that in America. Maybe there will be for the European market. In America only people like Madonna and N\u2019Sync record singles.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.7thhouse.com/news/Articles/gothic1.htm |title=DANZIG Articles |publisher=www.7thHouse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ARpcQRu?url=http://www.7thhouse.com/news/Articles/gothic1.htm |archive-date=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33px;\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:215px;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"5\"| Chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\"| US Sales<ref>[http://www.metalsludge.tv/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=66549&start=0&sid=4acc64c3baa32ccf36c5ac21049a232c Metal Sludge Gossip Board ::<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n! width=\"25\"| <small>[[Billboard 200|US]]<br/><ref name=\"us\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4024|pure_url=yes}} \"Danzig - Charts & Awards - Billboard Albums\"] ''[[allmusic]]''.

[[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] and [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] vocalist [[Glenn Danzig]]. The band has released eleven [[studio album]]s, one [[live album]], one [[compilation album]], two [[extended play|EP]]s and twenty-four [[Single (music)|singles]].\n\n==History==\nDanzig traces its beginnings back to July 14, 1986, when [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] performed at [[Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in [[New York City]]. In attendance was [[Rick Rubin]], who was scouting for potential bands to sign to his record label, [[Def Jam]]. Upon viewing Samhain's performance, Rubin was impressed with Glenn Danzig's powerful stage persona and vocal abilities. He met him after the show and propositioned him. At first, he wished only to sign Danzig, with the intent of making him the vocalist for a hard rock [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] that Rubin envisioned. However, Danzig refused to sign to Rubin's label without Samhain's bassist, [[Eerie Von]], with whom Danzig had become great friends. Rubin agreed to sign Samhain, and he began making suggestions for the new direction he felt the band should take. Rubin felt the music should be stripped down, and that Danzig's vocal talents should become the focal point for the band.\n\nIn 1987, the band evolved into a solid hard rock act, with the addition of [[John Christ]] on guitar and [[Chuck Biscuits]] on drums. To reflect the change in musical direction, and to avoid having to ever start anew in the event of future lineup changes, Danzig decided to change the name of Samhain to his own surname, Danzig. In 1988, the band issued its eponymous [[Danzig (album)|first album]] on Rubin's then-new label [[Def American]] (later renamed to [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]). The album featured polished production by Rubin, with heavy, blues-based guitar riffs and Danzig's powerful and melodic vocal performance\u2014a harsh contrast to the gritty, raw-sounding production of Samhain's albums. Two years later, Danzig released their second album ''[[Danzig II: Lucifuge|Lucifuge]]''.\n\nBy 1992, Rubin's involvement with the band had waned and Danzig himself took credit for co-producing the third album, ''[[Danzig III: How the Gods Kill]]''. In May 1993, the band released the ''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]'' EP, which contained several live tracks from the band's 1992 Halloween show, as well as three new studio tracks. The EP provided a hit for the band when the live version of \"Mother\" (a song from the first Danzig album) became popular on hard rock radio stations. A new version of the \"Mother\" music video was created using live footage, and the video became a hit on [[MTV]] as well, pushing Danzig into the mainstream. After an October 4, 1994 show in the [[Whisky A Go-Go]], [[Los Angeles]], Danzig received two [[RIAA certification|gold award]]s for an excess of 500,000 units sold both for their debut album and ''Thrall/Demosweatlive''.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, Danzig issued their [[Danzig 4|fourth album]], which was also successful and spawned the singles \"Until You Call on the Dark\" and \"Cantspeak\". However, shortly before the release of that album, Biscuits left the band and was replaced by future [[Queens of the Stone Age]] drummer [[Joey Castillo]].\n\nIn 1995, Danzig began to fall apart when Christ and Eerie Von decided to quit the group, leaving Glenn the only remaining original member. Many lineup changes happened since and Danzig released six more albums: ''[[Blackacidevil]]'' (1996), ''[[6:66 Satan's Child|Satan's Child]]'' (1999), ''[[I Luciferi]]'' (2002), ''[[Circle of Snakes]]'' (2004) and ''[[Deth Red Sabaoth]]'' (2010). As of February 2014, Danzig is working on a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/danzig-recording-new-material/ |title=Danzig Recording New Music |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref>\n\nDanzig also recorded the song \"Black Hell\" for the soundtrack to the 2011 film ''[[The Hangover Part II]]''.\n\nDanzig's commented on record singles and the band's approach to releasing singles in America: \"Singles? We don't do that in America. Maybe there will be for the European market. In America only people like Madonna and N\u2019Sync record singles.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.7thhouse.com/news/Articles/gothic1.htm |title=DANZIG Articles |publisher=www.7thHouse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ARpcQRu?url=http://www.7thhouse.com/news/Articles/gothic1.htm |archive-date=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33px;\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:215px;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"5\"| Chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\"| US Sales<ref>[http://www.metalsludge.tv/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=66549&start=0&sid=4acc64c3baa32ccf36c5ac21049a232c Metal Sludge Gossip Board ::<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n! width=\"25\"| <small>[[Billboard 200|US]]<br/><ref name=\"us\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4024|pure_url=yes}} \"Danzig - Charts & Awards - Billboard Albums\"] ''[[allmusic]]''.

In 1985, the book was renamed ''Legends & Lore'' due to concerns about bad publicity. The Babylonian, Finnish, nonhuman, and Sumerian content were removed to allow room for expansion of the remaining mythoi.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDDefinitiveFAQ.asp\n | title=Dungeons & Dragons FAQ\n | publisher=Wizards of the Coast\n | accessdate=2008-11-23\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' was published as a sourcebook for the second edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. This work re-introduced detailed information on the deities of several non-human pantheons.<ref name=FAQ /> The [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faer\u00fbnian pantheon]] for the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting was more fully detailed in 1996\u20131998 with the publication of ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', ''Powers & Pantheons'' and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]''.<ref name=FAQ />\n\n===Categories===\nThe deities are grouped into three categories:\n# Core powers \u2013 Deities presented in the ''Player's Handbook 3.5th edition'' or substantially introduced in the other two core books (''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''). Most of these deities are worshipped by [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]]. There is a subset within this category called '''Additional Deities''' which has deities not mentioned in the core rulebooks but instead in supplements and as such considered additions to the core category.\n# Alternate human pantheons \u2013 This lists the pantheons and the deities within them that are presented in the supplement book ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. Most are based upon real-life mythology.\n# Non-deity powers \u2013 These beings would fit into the previous category, but are not actually deities, plus most of them aren't the patron of a specific monstrous race. This includes the demon princes and archdevils as well as some other godlike beings.\n\nBefore third edition, there was no Core Setting, so the distinctions above are not as clear-cut. For the most part, materials which did not specify a setting were assumed to be at least compatible with the World of Greyhawk if not outright parts of the canon. As such, those prior materials are covered in the setting-specific lists of deities.\n\nThe book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', however, was considered to be canon for core materials for the gods of non-human races in second edition.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Ranks of divine power===\nFor game purposes, each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:\n*Quasi-deities or hero deities. Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers.\n*Demigods. They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.\n*Lesser deities. These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.\n*Intermediate deities. These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.\n*Greater deities. These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.\n*Overdeities. These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.\n\n===Portfolios===\nEvery deity has certain aspects of existence over which it has dominion, power, and control. Collectively, these aspects represent a deity's portfolio.\n\n===Domains===\nEach deity that can grant spells has multiple domains that give clerics access to extra spells and abilities from that domain. Which domains are associated with a deity is largely a function of the deity's portfolio.\n\n===Divine hierarchy===\nMany deities are arranged in pantheons, which are often led by Greater deities which are their direct superiors. The individual deities in a pantheon may not be forced to obey their superiors, although they typically respect and fear the superior deity.\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons''==\n''[[Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes]]'' (1976) included the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[mythology|mythologies]], as well as [[Robert E.

They selected and altered deities to correspond to \"iconic\" aspects of core D&D. Most core deities are human deities; except for the chief gods of the demihuman races. Certain aspects of the deities were altered to make them more generic \u2013 for example: the \"Core\" Heironeous favors the longsword (in order to make the favored weapon of the \"God of Chivalry\" more traditionally knight-like), as contrasted with the original \"Greyhawk\" Heironeous, who favors the battleaxe.\n\nThe designation of \"greater\" vs. \"intermediate\" comes from ''Legends & Lore'' (1990). It is not used in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|any edition of]] the ''Player's Handbook'', but it is used in ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' (2002) and various v3.5 [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Edition]] materials.\n\n===Core ''D&D''-pantheons===\n====Greater deities====\n*Boccob, god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight.<ref name=\"PHB35\">{{cite book |authorlink=Jonathan Tweet|last=Tweet |first=Jonathan |authorlink2=Monte Cook|last2=Cook|first2=Monte |authorlink3=Skip Williams|last3=Williams|first3=Skip |title=Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook I v.3.5 |year=2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2886-7}}</ref>{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\">{{cite book |authorlink=Rich Redman|last=Redman |first=Rich |authorlink2=Skip Williams|last2=Williams|first2=Skip |authorlink3=James Wyatt (game designer)|last3=Wyatt|first3=James |title=[[Deities and Demigods]] |year=2002 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2654-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n*[[Corellon Larethian]], god of [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], magic, music, and arts (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|62}}<ref name=\"Wild\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Skip |title=Races of the Wild |year=2005 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3438-7}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n*Garl Glittergold, god of [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]], humor, and gemcutting (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|69}}<ref name=\"Stone\">{{cite book |authorlink=David Noonan (game designer)|last=Noonan |first=David |authorlink2=Jesse Decker|last2=Decker|first2=Jesse |authorlink3=Michelle Lyons|last3=Lyons|first3=Michelle |title=[[Races of Stone]] |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3278-3}}</ref>{{rp|43}}<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=David |title=Complete Divine |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3272-4}}</ref>{{rp|109,112}}\n*[[Gruumsh]], god of orcs (also a monster power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|71}}\n*[[Moradin]], god of [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]] (also a demihuman power)<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"Stone\" />{{rp|17}}\n*[[Nerull]], god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld.<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,108}}<ref name=\"LibrisMortis\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer)|first2=Bruce R.|last2=Cordell|authorlink2=Bruce R.

Being monotheistic, it of course consists of only one deity (though said deity is described as having two aspects; a creator one and a destroyer one):\n\n*Taiia, greater goddess of creation, destruction, mortal life and death.\n\n====Following the Light====\nFollowing the Light is a fictional [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] religion presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for dualistic religions in 3rd Edition Deities and Demigods. Being dualistic, it consists of two, polar-opposite deities:\n\n*Elishar, intermediate deity of positive energy, light and prophecy.\n*Toldoth, intermediate deity of negative energy, darkness and destruction.\n\n====Dennari====\nThe faith of Dennari is a fictional [[mystery cult]], presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for mystery cults in 3rd Edition ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. It worships a single deity of the same name:\n\n*Dennari, lesser goddess of earth, liberation and suffering.\n\n=== Nondeity powers ===\nSimilar to monster powers, these are not true deities but very powerful extraplanar beings. These however do not even profess to be gods (though many still have designs on godhood).\n\n====Fiendish entities====\n===== Demon lords of the Abyss =====\nThe single unifying feature of all [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon lords]] (also called demon princes) is the inherent control over part of the infinite layers of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]].

Implied to be the creator of humans, the devils wiped out all knowledge of his name, which they fear is powerful enough to revive him if it is ever spoken aloud again. The Nine Hells were originally his astral domain, now a prison for Asmodeus and his devils. A holy chalice belonging to him is mentioned in ''Divine Power''.\n* Khala \u2013 Goddess of Winter, wife of Zehir, Khala sought to trap the natural world in an eternal winter to secure power over it. Her plans convinced the primal spirits to expel gods and primordials from the world. She was killed by the other gods in a conflict called the War of Winter, who afterwards made a compact to balance darkness and light (Zehir and Pelor), and the natural seasons (Corellon, Pelor and Sehanine). Her power over winter was taken by the [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Lakal]] \u2013 God of Healing and Mercy who was also her own Astral Dominion. She was an impersonal deity who communicated with her chosen people, the Quom, through \"ecstatic moments of personal communion.\" She extolled mercy and urged her followers to dedicate themselves to pursuits that benefited the whole cosmos. Lakal's death was accidental \u2013 when Bahamut battled Nihil, the Primordial of nothingness, the pair crashed into Lakal. Bahamut was able to use the distraction to slay Nihil, but the primordial's death throes also caused Lakal to explode. The surviving quom now roam the planes, retrieving any shards of Lakal that they can find, including those unknowingly consumed by living creatures. Such creatures, including humanoids and player characters, are considered collateral damage in the quom's quest to restore Lakal. Ironically, even if the quom succeed in their quest, the restored Lakal would be disgusted with their methods.<ref>[[Rob Heinsoo|Heinsoo, Rob]], ''[[The Plane Above]]''.

When she failed to assassinate a high priest of [[Pelor]], she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil. She was later killed by a poison that could kill anything\u2014even a deity\u2014that was distilled from Zehir's blood.<ref name=\"Dragon390\">{{cite book |author=Pierre Van Rooden |magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] 390 |title=Power Play: Divine - Dead Gods |year=August 2010 |page=47 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref>\n\n== Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ==\nThese are the deities for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.

This work was superseded by the ''[[Deities & Demigods]]'' source book, which was first published in 1980.<ref>{{cite book\n | first=Lawrence |last=Schick |year=1991\n | title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games\n | publisher=Prometheus Books\n | location=Buffalo, New York |isbn=0-87975-653-5}}</ref> The first printing included the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], but both this and the Melnibon\u00e9an mythos were removed by the third printing because of potential copyright issues. In 1985, the book was renamed ''Legends & Lore'' due to concerns about bad publicity. The Babylonian, Finnish, nonhuman, and Sumerian content were removed to allow room for expansion of the remaining mythoi.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDDefinitiveFAQ.asp\n | title=Dungeons & Dragons FAQ\n | publisher=Wizards of the Coast\n | accessdate=2008-11-23\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' was published as a sourcebook for the second edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. This work re-introduced detailed information on the deities of several non-human pantheons.<ref name=FAQ /> The [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faer\u00fbnian pantheon]] for the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting was more fully detailed in 1996\u20131998 with the publication of ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', ''Powers & Pantheons'' and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]''.<ref name=FAQ />\n\n===Categories===\nThe deities are grouped into three categories:\n# Core powers \u2013 Deities presented in the ''Player's Handbook 3.5th edition'' or substantially introduced in the other two core books (''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''). Most of these deities are worshipped by [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]]. There is a subset within this category called '''Additional Deities''' which has deities not mentioned in the core rulebooks but instead in supplements and as such considered additions to the core category.\n# Alternate human pantheons \u2013 This lists the pantheons and the deities within them that are presented in the supplement book ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. Most are based upon real-life mythology.\n# Non-deity powers \u2013 These beings would fit into the previous category, but are not actually deities, plus most of them aren't the patron of a specific monstrous race. This includes the demon princes and archdevils as well as some other godlike beings.\n\nBefore third edition, there was no Core Setting, so the distinctions above are not as clear-cut. For the most part, materials which did not specify a setting were assumed to be at least compatible with the World of Greyhawk if not outright parts of the canon. As such, those prior materials are covered in the setting-specific lists of deities.\n\nThe book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', however, was considered to be canon for core materials for the gods of non-human races in second edition.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Ranks of divine power===\nFor game purposes, each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:\n*Quasi-deities or hero deities. Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers.\n*Demigods. They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.\n*Lesser deities. These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.\n*Intermediate deities. These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.\n*Greater deities. These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.\n*Overdeities. These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.\n\n===Portfolios===\nEvery deity has certain aspects of existence over which it has dominion, power, and control. Collectively, these aspects represent a deity's portfolio.\n\n===Domains===\nEach deity that can grant spells has multiple domains that give clerics access to extra spells and abilities from that domain. Which domains are associated with a deity is largely a function of the deity's portfolio.\n\n===Divine hierarchy===\nMany deities are arranged in pantheons, which are often led by Greater deities which are their direct superiors. The individual deities in a pantheon may not be forced to obey their superiors, although they typically respect and fear the superior deity.\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons''==\n''[[Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes]]'' (1976) included the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[mythology|mythologies]], as well as [[Robert E.

They selected and altered deities to correspond to \"iconic\" aspects of core D&D. Most core deities are human deities; except for the chief gods of the demihuman races. Certain aspects of the deities were altered to make them more generic \u2013 for example: the \"Core\" Heironeous favors the longsword (in order to make the favored weapon of the \"God of Chivalry\" more traditionally knight-like), as contrasted with the original \"Greyhawk\" Heironeous, who favors the battleaxe.\n\nThe designation of \"greater\" vs. \"intermediate\" comes from ''Legends & Lore'' (1990). It is not used in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|any edition of]] the ''Player's Handbook'', but it is used in ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' (2002) and various v3.5 [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Edition]] materials.\n\n===Core ''D&D''-pantheons===\n====Greater deities====\n*Boccob, god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight.<ref name=\"PHB35\">{{cite book |authorlink=Jonathan Tweet|last=Tweet |first=Jonathan |authorlink2=Monte Cook|last2=Cook|first2=Monte |authorlink3=Skip Williams|last3=Williams|first3=Skip |title=Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook I v.3.5 |year=2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2886-7}}</ref>{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\">{{cite book |authorlink=Rich Redman|last=Redman |first=Rich |authorlink2=Skip Williams|last2=Williams|first2=Skip |authorlink3=James Wyatt (game designer)|last3=Wyatt|first3=James |title=[[Deities and Demigods]] |year=2002 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2654-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n*[[Corellon Larethian]], god of [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], magic, music, and arts (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|62}}<ref name=\"Wild\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Skip |title=Races of the Wild |year=2005 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3438-7}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n*Garl Glittergold, god of [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]], humor, and gemcutting (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|69}}<ref name=\"Stone\">{{cite book |authorlink=David Noonan (game designer)|last=Noonan |first=David |authorlink2=Jesse Decker|last2=Decker|first2=Jesse |authorlink3=Michelle Lyons|last3=Lyons|first3=Michelle |title=[[Races of Stone]] |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3278-3}}</ref>{{rp|43}}<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=David |title=Complete Divine |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3272-4}}</ref>{{rp|109,112}}\n*[[Gruumsh]], god of orcs (also a monster power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|71}}\n*[[Moradin]], god of [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]] (also a demihuman power)<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"Stone\" />{{rp|17}}\n*[[Nerull]], god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld.<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,108}}<ref name=\"LibrisMortis\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer)|first2=Bruce R.|last2=Cordell|authorlink2=Bruce R.

Being monotheistic, it of course consists of only one deity (though said deity is described as having two aspects; a creator one and a destroyer one):\n\n*Taiia, greater goddess of creation, destruction, mortal life and death.\n\n====Following the Light====\nFollowing the Light is a fictional [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] religion presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for dualistic religions in 3rd Edition Deities and Demigods. Being dualistic, it consists of two, polar-opposite deities:\n\n*Elishar, intermediate deity of positive energy, light and prophecy.\n*Toldoth, intermediate deity of negative energy, darkness and destruction.\n\n====Dennari====\nThe faith of Dennari is a fictional [[mystery cult]], presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for mystery cults in 3rd Edition ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. It worships a single deity of the same name:\n\n*Dennari, lesser goddess of earth, liberation and suffering.\n\n=== Nondeity powers ===\nSimilar to monster powers, these are not true deities but very powerful extraplanar beings. These however do not even profess to be gods (though many still have designs on godhood).\n\n====Fiendish entities====\n===== Demon lords of the Abyss =====\nThe single unifying feature of all [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon lords]] (also called demon princes) is the inherent control over part of the infinite layers of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]]. Only the first 666 layers of The Abyss are generally known, and of those only a small fraction of the princes of those layers are a part of the D&D cosmology.\n*[[Baphomet (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baphomet, Prince of Beasts]], demon prince of beasts and vengeance (also the monster power of [[Minotaur (Dungeons & Dragons)|minotaurs]])<ref name=\"CodexI\">{{cite book |authorlink=Ed Stark|last=Stark |first=Ed |authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|last2=Jacobs|first2=James |authorlink3=Erik Mona|last3=Mona|first3=Erik |title=[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]] |year=2006 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3919-2}}</ref>{{rp|58}}\n*[[Dagon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dagon]], demon prince and patron of the deep sea.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|59}}\n*[[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], self-proclaimed \"Prince of Demons\".<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|61}}\n*[[Eltab]], demon prince of hatred and retribution.\n*[[Fraz-Urb'luu]], demon prince and patron of illusionists and tricksters.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|63}}\n*[[Graz'zt]], demon prince and patron of rulers by force.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|65}}\n*[[Juiblex]], demon prince and patron of oozes and slimes.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|66}}\n*[[Kostchtchie]], demon prince of the 23rd layer of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]], the Ice Wastes; patron of evil frost giants.<ref name=\"Frostburn\">{{cite book |authorlink=Wolfgang Baur|last=Baur |first=Wolfgang |authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|last2=Jacobs|first2=James |authorlink3=George Strayton|last3=Strayton|first3=George |title=Frostburn: Mastering the Perils of Ice and Snow |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2896-4}}</ref>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|68}}\n*[[Lolth]], demon princess of spiders, evil, darkness, chaos and assassins.

They are to the [[Celestial (Dungeons & Dragons)|celestials]] as the archdevils are to the devils and the demon lords are to demons.\n\n=====Archon paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[Archon (Dungeons & Dragons)|archons]] are known collectively as the '''Celestial Hebdomad'''. They rule the layers of the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Plane]] of [[Mount Celestia]].\n\n;[[Barachiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barachiel]]\n: ruler of the Silver Heaven of Lunia, the bottom layer of Celestia.\n;[[Domiel]]\n: ruler of the Golden Heaven of Mercuria, the second layer of Celestia.\n;[[Erathaol]]\n: ruler of Venya, the Pearly Heaven, the third layer of Celestia.\n;[[Pistis Sophia (Dungeons & Dragons)|Pistis Sophia]]\n: ruler of Solania, the Crystal Heaven, the fourth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Raziel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Raziel]]\n: ruler of Mertion, the Platinum Heaven, the fifth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Sealtiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sealtiel]]\n: ruler of Jovar, the Glittering Heaven, the sixth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Zaphkiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Zaphkiel]]\n: ruler of the Illuminated Heaven of Chronias, the seventh layer of Celestia.\n\n=====Eladrin paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[eladrin]]s are collectively known as '''The Court of Stars'''. They hail from the Plane of [[Arborea (Dungeons & Dragons)|Arborea]].\n\n;[[Faerinaal]]\n: oversees the defense of the Court of Stars and liberates eladrins captured by evil forces.\n;[[Gwynharwyf]]\n: Queen Morwel's loyal champion and a barbarian of unparalleled ferocity.\n;[[Morwel]]\n: the ruler of the eladrins and the Court of Stars.\n\n=====Guardinal paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[guardinal]]s are collectively known as '''Talisid and the Five Companions'''.

Spends most of his time on Amoria, the topmost layer of Elysium.\n;Vhara\n: the duchess of the Equinals, resides on Amoria.\n\n==== Archomentals ====\n[[Archomental]]s are powerful exemplary beings of the [[Inner Plane|Elemental Planes]] and the rulers of the [[Elemental (Dungeons & Dragons)|elementals]]. Although they are not truly rulers of their planes, archomentals like to consider themselves as much and often grant themselves regal titles like Prince or Princess. They are compared in the source material to the archfiends or celestial paragons, and are considered to be the elemental equivalent of such beings.\n\n===== Evil Archomentals =====\nThe evil archomentals are collectively known as the Princes of Elemental Evil. The five most famous are:\n\n*[[Cryonax]], prince of evil cold creatures.\n*[[Imix (Dungeons & Dragons)|Imix]], prince of evil fire creatures.\n*[[Ogr\u00e9moch]], prince of evil earth creatures.\n*[[Olhydra]], princess of evil water creatures.\n*[[Yan-C-Bin]], prince of evil air creatures.\n\n===== Good Archomentals =====\nThe good archomentals are collectively known as the Elemental Princes of Good.

In ''The Inner Planes'' (TSR, 1998) he is described as evil tyrant.\n*[[Ehkahk]], prince of smoke creatures.\n\n==== Slaad Lords ====\nThe Slaad Lords are the de facto rules of the [[Slaad]]i race and the plane of [[Limbo (Dungeons & Dragons)|Limbo]]. Though true to their chaotic nature they often do not appear anything like other Slaadi.\n\n*[[Chourst]], lord of randomness.\n*[[Rennbuu]], lord of colors.\n*[[Ssendam]], lord of madness.\n*[[Wartle]], domain unknown.\n*[[Ygorl]], lord of entropy.\n\n==== Titans ====\n\"Titans are closer to the well spring of life and thus experience more pronounced emotion including Deity-like fits of rage. In ages past some rebelled against the deities themselves...\"<ref>''Monster Manual'' 3.5 edition</ref>\n\n==== The Lady of Pain ====\nThe Lady of Pain is an enigmatic being who oversees the city of [[Sigil (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sigil]] in the plane of the [[Concordant Domain of the Outlands|Outlands]]. Almost nothing is known about her; her origin, her race, her motives and her level of power are all obscure, although she is sometimes shown to have absolutely immense power. The Lady of Pain refuses to tolerate anyone who worships her, killing those who do so. Again; virtually nothing is known about her, apart from the fact that she has the power to slay gods who displease her.\n\n==== Vestiges ====\nThese entities are outside the boundary of life, death, and undeath. They are untouchable by even the most powerful deities although they can be summoned and used by the weakest mortal through pact magic and binding. Binders are often feared and hunted down by \"Witch Slayers.\" The list of vestiges that can be bonded with include:\n\n*[[Acererak]]: The Eternal.\n*[[Agares]]: Truth Betrayed.\n*[[Aamon|Amon]]: The Void Before The Altar.\n*[[Andras]]: The Grey Knight.\n*[[Andromalius]]: The Repentant Rogue.\n*[[Aim (demon)|Aym]]: Queen Avarice.\n*[[Balam (demon)|Balam]]: The Bitter Angel.\n*[[Buer (demon)|Buer]]: Grandmother Huntress.\n*[[Chupoclops]]: Harbinger of Forever.\n*[[Dahlver-Nar]]: The Tortured One.\n*[[Dantalion]]: The Star Emperor.\n*[[Eligor]]: Dragon's Slayer.\n*[[Eurynome]]: Mother of the Material.\n*[[Focalor]]: Prince of Tears.\n*Geryon: The Deposed Lord.\n*[[Haagenti]]: Mother of Minotaurs.\n*[[Malthus (demon)|Halphax]]: Angel in the Angle.\n*[[Haures]]: The Dreaming Duke.\n*[[Ipos]]: Prince of Fools.\n*[[Karsus]]: Hubris in the Blood.\n*[[Leraje]]: The Green Herald.\n*[[Malphas]]: The Turnfeather.\n*[[Marchosias]]: King of Killers.\n*[[Naberius]]: The Grinning Hound.\n*Orthos: Sovereign of the Howling Dark.\n*[[Otiax]]: The Key to the Gate.\n*[[Paimon]]: The Dancer.\n*[[Ronove]]: The Iron Maiden.\n*[[Savnok]]: The Instigator.\n*Shax: Sea Sister.\n*[[Tenebrous]]: The Shadow That Was.\n*[[Zagan (demon)|Zagan]]: Duke of Disappointment.\n\nVestiges were introduced in D&D: ''[[Tome of Magic]]'' supplement \nby Matthew Sernett, [[Ari Marmell]], [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]], [[Robert J.

Wizards of the Coast (C) March 2006.\n\nThe supplement ''[[Dragon Magic]]'', by [[Rodney Thompson]] and Owen Stephens published in September 2006, introduces this vestige:\n*[[Ashardalon]]: Pyre of the Unborn\n\nWizards of the Coast created these vestiges online:\n*[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060407a Vanus: the Reviled One]\n*[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20070307a Astaroth: Unjustly Fallen, and Desharis: the Sprawling Soul]\n*[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20070119a Arete: the First Elan, Gorn-Rujsha-Mintar: the Triad, and Abism: the Schismad]\n*[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frcc/20070718 Zceryll: the Star Spawn]\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons'' 4th edition==\nThese are the deities for the non-Greyhawk default campaign setting of 4th edition ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (informally referred to as the \"points of light\" setting). The list includes long-time D&D establishments from Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, as well as several original gods. Although some gods are patrons of specific races, they are worshipped by all, and racial pantheons do not exist in this edition. Many lesser gods from previous editions (such as the Seldarine or most members of the dwarven pantheon) now have the status of Exarch, a demipower in service to a greater god.\n\n===Good and Lawful Good deities===\n*[[Avandra]] \u2013 Good Goddess of Change, Luck and Travel, Patron of Halflings.

Ioun is an ally of Corellon, Erathis and Pelor. She is the antithesis of Vecna, as she urges her followers to share all knowledge that he would keep hidden. Ioun is the second most popular deity among metallic dragons, second only to Bahamut. Her name is derived from the [[Ioun stones]].\n*[[Kord (Greyhawk)|Kord]] \u2013 Unaligned God of Storms, Battle and Strength.\n*[[Melora (Dungeons & Dragons)|Melora]] \u2013 Unaligned Goddess of Wilderness, Nature and the Sea\n*[[Raven Queen]] \u2013 Unaligned Goddess of Death, Fate and Doom.

Implied to be the creator of humans, the devils wiped out all knowledge of his name, which they fear is powerful enough to revive him if it is ever spoken aloud again. The Nine Hells were originally his astral domain, now a prison for Asmodeus and his devils. A holy chalice belonging to him is mentioned in ''Divine Power''.\n* Khala \u2013 Goddess of Winter, wife of Zehir, Khala sought to trap the natural world in an eternal winter to secure power over it. Her plans convinced the primal spirits to expel gods and primordials from the world. She was killed by the other gods in a conflict called the War of Winter, who afterwards made a compact to balance darkness and light (Zehir and Pelor), and the natural seasons (Corellon, Pelor and Sehanine). Her power over winter was taken by the [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Lakal]] \u2013 God of Healing and Mercy who was also her own Astral Dominion. She was an impersonal deity who communicated with her chosen people, the Quom, through \"ecstatic moments of personal communion.\" She extolled mercy and urged her followers to dedicate themselves to pursuits that benefited the whole cosmos. Lakal's death was accidental \u2013 when Bahamut battled Nihil, the Primordial of nothingness, the pair crashed into Lakal. Bahamut was able to use the distraction to slay Nihil, but the primordial's death throes also caused Lakal to explode. The surviving quom now roam the planes, retrieving any shards of Lakal that they can find, including those unknowingly consumed by living creatures. Such creatures, including humanoids and player characters, are considered collateral damage in the quom's quest to restore Lakal.

When she failed to assassinate a high priest of [[Pelor]], she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil. She was later killed by a poison that could kill anything\u2014even a deity\u2014that was distilled from Zehir's blood.<ref name=\"Dragon390\">{{cite book |author=Pierre Van Rooden |magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] 390 |title=Power Play: Divine - Dead Gods |year=August 2010 |page=47 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref>\n\n== Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ==\nThese are the deities for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.

{"title_page": "List of High School DxD characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''High School DxD'' characters}}\nThe [[light novel]], [[manga]], and [[anime]] series ''[[High School DxD]]'' features a diverse cast of characters. The visuals of the characters were designed by Miyama-Zero and their stories were created by [[Ichiei Ishibumi]]. The stories follow the adventures of [[#Issei Hyodo|Issei Hyodo]], a perverted high school guy who is killed by his first date, but reborn as a devil to serve [[Rias Gremory]], a crimson-haired school beauty who heads the {{nihongo|Occult Research Club|\u30aa\u30ab\u30eb\u30c8\u7814\u7a76\u90e8|Okaruto Kenky\u016b-bu}}. Issei, Rias, and the club members interact with various groups and organizations, some of which are run by devils who compete against them in sanctioned combat matches called Rating Games, where the characters have been assigned positions akin to chess pieces.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\nAuthor Ichiei Ishibumi had previously worked on a horror genre series two years before publishing the first light novel for ''High School DxD''. In the volume 1 afterword, he mentions that he changed his writing style, and wanted to develop one in the school-life, love-comedy, battle, and fantasy genre. His main character Issei was made into a lecherous guy at the request of his editor. For the first volume, he made Rias a second lead character and heroine, and Asia to be the second heroine. Some of his characters are loosely referenced from the Bible, non-fiction books, and mythology. He created a world where the war between the three main factions (angels, devils, and fallen angels) is over, and where many famous angels and devils have already ceased to exist. He also added characters and legendary beasts from a variety of places from Norse mythology to Japanese ''[[yokai]]''.{{Ref label|LN 1|LN 1 afterword}} Ishibumi named the Four Great Devils after characters from the ''[[Gundam]]'' media franchise. For example, [[#Sirzechs Lucifer|Sirzechs Lucifer]] is a combination of [[Char Aznable]] and [[Zechs Merquise]], and [[#Millicas|Millicas]] is named after Merquise and Aznable's real names Milliardo and Casval.<ref name=\"sirzechs derivation\">{{cite tweet |author= Ichiei Ishibumi |user= ishibumi_ddd|number= 251842044627136513 |date= September 22, 2012 |title= \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30df\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\uff0b\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30d0\u30eb\u3067\u3059\u3002\u306a\u305c\u306a\u3089\u3001\u7236\u89aa\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30bc\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u540d\u524d\u30cd\u30bf\u304c\u30b7\u30e3\u30a2\uff0b\u30bc\u30af\u30b9\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002 | trans-title=Yes, it is Millardo and Casval.

Later in the fight, he turned the shadows into grotesque parodies of creatures like one-eyed wolves and five-winged birds to swarm Georg. The fear of this power was the main reason he was bullied and cast out by his clan, his mixed heritage and Forbidden Balor View were just additional, but more minor, public reasons.\n--->\n<!--\nGasper is a child of a Vampire Lord and a human woman, and thus is hated by many of his own clan, including his siblings, mainly due to the Vampires discriminating which is stronger than the other races. Other than the father being from the Vladi bloodline of Daywalkers, there has been little told about the history or current condition of either. Eventually, he was chased out of his house and was targeted by vampire hunters who killed him. It was around that time Rias found him and, taking pity on the boy, reincarnated him into a Devil through a use of a Bishop Mutation Piece.\n\nAlthough Rias intends on talking to the Vladi clan about this, she is worried that they will continue to refuse to talk to her still and she has few ways of encouraging cooperation. Especially as vampires do not get along well with Devils and have a strict, pure-blooded aristocracy who are so arrogant that not even a single family has ever cared about their servants even a tenth of much as the Gremory family has cared for their servants. Also, any vampire with a human in their parentage, whether humans-turned vampires or are descended from one, are ''never'' allowed to become nobles and considered substandard members of the species, assuming they're even considered vampires in the first place.\n\nAfter a tea party with Valerie, Marius appeared and agreed to Gasper's request to \"free\" Valerie. Gasper later learned the truth to Marius' true purpose and becomes determined to save Valerie. Upon reaching the lowest level of the basement, Gasper was shocked and despaired to see Marius having extracted the Longinus from Valerie as he shares one last conversation before Valerie's \"death\". When the mass-produced Evil Dragons start attacking, Gasper used his darkness to cover the entire town, devouring the mass-produced Evil Dragons before going to assist Issei who was fighting Euclid Lucifuge. Gasper then attempted to attack Rizevim who gives out a retreat order but to no avail due to Rizevim's ability. After Rizevim and his team left, Gasper carried Valerie with him and had one last conversation with his father.\n-->\n\n===Azazel===\n{{voiced by|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]]<ref name=\"ann 20150108\"/>}}\n\n{{Nihongo|Azazel|\u30a2\u30b6\u30bc\u30eb|Azazeru}} is the Governor-General of the [[#Fallen angels|fallen angels]].

Introduced as Odin's bodyguard, Rossweisse always prevents him from doing dirty things; however in retaliation, Odin always teases her for being a Valkyrie that has no boyfriend. Eventually, after the battle with [[Loki]] and [[Fenrir]], Odin leaves her in Issei's town and later gets persuaded by Rias to become her servant, her ranking being \"Rook\" alongside Koneko, and remains in Kuoh Academy as a teacher.\n\nUnlike most of the female characters who already have a crush on Issei, she is still figuring out if she likes him or not. She is extremely bitter on the fact that she does not have a boyfriend and gets angry when she is made fun of for that. Odin uses this several times to knock the wind out of her when she is protesting or interfering with him doing something vulgar. She has a tendency to buy things at sales when they're cheap, allowing Issei to coin for her the nickname {{nihongo|\"The 100-Yen Shop Valkyrie\"|100\u5747\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ad\u30ea\u30fc|}}. This also shows during the Kyoto trip when Issei used dress break on her so he could peep on the female students in the hot springs by her getting mad and lecturing him about destroying her clothes ''before'' getting embarrassed about being naked. She moves into the Hyodo Residence in Volume 8. She left to train with a Norse mage she knows in Volume 11 and returns in Volume 12 after learning new, powerful defensive spells along with how to combine them with the defensive traits of Rook. Thus, gaining enough power to defend against Balance Breakers and even the equivalent of 10x the damage that Heracles' Balance Breaker can create.\n\nIn Volume 14 both the Gremory and Sitri groups are surprised to hear her speak in an unpolished, country voice while talking to her grandmother in her homeland. Also, its noted that part of the reason she is so concerned about money is that she has been sending money over to her grandmother, to help out since the area her hometown is in is described as having nothing and essentially barren. She is currently pursuing two goals, the first is to create a school to teach devils how to become Valkyries, and the second is to open a discount store that carries everything in her homeland. In Volume 17 she asks Issei to pretend to be her boyfriend to convince her grandmother G\u00f6ndul that she is safe in her new life as a devil and as teacher. During her date with Issei, she mentions that when she was a student she wrote an essay that could show a way of sealing the Trihexa (666). Sona invites her to be an expositor at the inauguration of her school and even offers her a position as teacher in a few years. Euclid Lucifuge tries to kidnap her not only for the information, but also because he sees her as a replacement for his sister Grayfia. She helps Issei defeat him and it becomes clear that she has finally fallen in love with him.\n\n===Ravel Phoenix {{anchor|Ravel Phenex}} ===\n{{anime voices|[[Asuka Nishi]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}\n\n{{Nihongo|Ravel Phoenix|\u30ec\u30a4\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a7\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30b9|Reiveru Fenikkusu}} is the blonde-haired younger sister of [[#Riser Phoenix|Riser]] and a former member of his team.{{Ref label|S1 ep 11|S1 ep 11}} She first appears in volume 2 of the light novels as a bishop who has yet to reveal her true powers.{{Ref label|LN 2|LN 2}} She follows her brother in the belief that no one could defeat him.

As a result, she dreamed of becoming a woman who could become a support for her ideal hero but as she grew older she slowly forgot this dream. Watching Issei fight for the sake of the woman he loves at Riser's engagement party reminded Ravel of her forgotten dream and instilled a desire to understand everything about him.\n\nAs the story develops, she falls in love with him completely, and does not mind becoming his concubine so long as she can be with him. She is currently a \"free\" bishop: her mother (who does not participate in Rating Games) traded one of her unused bishop pieces to Riser for Ravel. She has later traded herself to become one of Issei's Bishops when he has gained peerage, as she wanted to be of use to Issei. She moves into the Hyodo Residence in Volume 10 and enrolls in Kuoh Academy as a first-year student, alongside Koneko and Gasper. She is in Koneko's class at school and despite the two of them bickering often (paying homage to the vitriolic relationship between cats and birds, given their species), they are very close friends. Currently, she is one of Issei's managers (alongside [[#Grayfia Lucifuge|Grayfia]]) and had been tutoring him so that he is able to pass the written part of the exam to become a Middle-Class Devil. During the events of Volume 12, the Phoenix family indicates that not only are they going to allow her to \"stay\" at Issei's house to \"attend school\", they are also hoping that she enters into an intimate relationship with Issei (for various reasons).\n\n===Ophis {{anchor|Ophis}} ===\n{{anime voices|[[Suzuko Mimori]]|[[Megan Shipman]]}}\n\n<!-- Ophis is the spelling as per the Funimation dub.

She organized the [[#Chaos Brigade|Chaos Brigade]] with the hopes of getting rid of [[#Great Red|Great Red]] from the Dimensional Gap. However, she was betrayed by Cao Cao who stole her power under the intention of creating another Ophis, rendering her in a presumed powerless state. Cao Cao, however, underestimated her, as she has released her powers in forms of snakes before Cao Cao came to steal her powers. As such, she did not lose most of her powers. Like Great Red, Ophis does not like to interfere in the matters of the world, having interest only in Great Red. As such, she is more of a figurehead than a leader of the Chaos Brigade, and any plans or acts not pertaining to Great Red were by the will of the members, not hers.\n\nIn Volume 12, she is rescued by Great Red and helped him in restoring Issei's body. The two seem interested in Issei, and both were saying \"Zoom Zoom Iyaaan\" after the battle with the Jabberwocky to Issei and Ddraig's dismay. Although she does not say it, she is probably very fond of Issei, as he is her first friend and had offered her a home in his house in Volume 11. This is a big deal as she had helped protect Asia and Irina later in the volume simply because they had tea and played cards together. According to Issei, Ophis is not evil, just na\u00efve and did not mind being used by the Chaos Brigade, as they had promised to kill Great Red for her. Currently, the faction heads have used numerous seals to hide her presence. This is to avoid upsetting members of their factions and hide her from the remaining members of the Chaos Brigade. Even with the power stolen from her, they are aware that she is too powerful to control, but are allowing her to stay with Issei to encourage the interest she seems to be showing for him. She later moves into the Hyodo Residence at the end of Volume 12 to continue \"observing\" Issei, saying she has a vested interest in him as a part of her was used to recreate Issei's body with Great Red's flesh. Currently, she seems to be welcoming the feeling of having an actual home and friends, even to the point of not attempting to do any significant damage to Great Red other than kicking him during the time she and Issei were riding his back.\n\n==Devils==\n{{nihongo|Devils|\u60aa\u9b54|Akuma}} represent one of the three major supernatural groups (the others being the [[#Fallen angels|fallen angels]] and the [[#Angels|angels]] in a three-way struggle over the control of the world).

Grayfia comes from the House of Lucifuge, a family of pure-blooded Devils from the Extra Demons whose family served under the original Lucifer. She is a Devil on par with the Four Maous, and is known as the \"Strongest Queen\". She once challenged Serafall for the spot of Leviathan. She is nicknamed the {{nihongo foot|Silver-Haired Queen of Devourer|\u9280\u9aea\u306e\u6bb2\u6ec5\u5973\u738b\uff08\u304e\u3093\u3071\u3064\u306e\u30af\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30d0\u30a6\u30a2\uff09|Ginpatsu no Kw\u012bn obu Deibaua|lit. \"Silver-Haired Queen of Annihilation\"|group=lower-alpha}} and uses ice-based magic. For some reason, she does not appreciate having family titles or ties to the Gremory family mentioned while a maid. As a maid, she always acts in a cold, calm, and professional manner with extremely rare instances of emotions showing in her face or voice. This is because when she is a maid she wants to do it completely, which has resulted in her having a relationship with the Gremory family as a maid. One of the few instances she showed emotion was in Volume 2 during her conversation with Issei just before she gave him the magic circle to crash Riser's engagement party and release a griffin to ride home on. She acts and expects to be treated with the difference between a noble and servant, although she still reserves the right to chastise Lucifer and Millicas if they act improper or acknowledge her as part of the family and not a maid or Sirzech's Queen. She enjoys doing small tasks and housework and it seems easier to move around doing simple matters as a maid than the wife of a devil king. Every now and then, she will take a day off as a maid and become a high-class lady who is to be acknowledged as a noble lady of the Gremory Family, Sirzech's wife and Rias' older sister. While maintaining the proper demeanor of a noble lady, she does allow emotions to show on her face and is less reserved around others. So far, she has only been seen to take a day off once in the Extra Life chapter of Volume 8 in the light novels.

Adding to her childlike personality, she calls Sona {{nihongo|\"So-tan\"|\u30bd\u30fc\u305f\u3093|S\u014d-tan}} and refers to others with the \"-chan\" honorific. She is the devil king in charge of foreign affairs (other factions).

Unlike Rias and Sirzechs, Sairaorg did not inherit the Power of Destruction from his lineage. Because of this, his younger brother was the one who had been chosen to become the heir of the Bael Family. Misla encourages him to become stronger in other ways, which resulted in him training his body with martial arts, pushing himself to his utmost limits to become powerful.

Since she needed to borrow Issei for an unnamed reason, and the Occult Research Club needed a report on monsters ASAP (Rias has to do the report to earn credits at Demon School, if she's ever short she'll have to return to the Underworld, with her servants, and attend Demon School in person.) As Rias did not want to loan Issei and Abe was wary of them, it was decided to have a tennis match where the winner got what they wanted for free, no strings attached. For the match, Abe used a Harpy (lost) and a Lamia (won) for the two singles games and played doubles with Christie against Rias and Issei for the tie-breaker. Christie's freezing breath was hampering Issei's meager skills so he put on Honda (who was as upset as Issei that Yuki-onna weren't beautiful maidens, but yetis) which help Rias and him win. Later on, she asks Rias if she can borrow Issei to cancel an arranged marriage her father was pushing for.  Rias having escaped an arranged marriage herself agrees, but only if the whole group can come in exchange for some information Kiyome knows about various monsters and mythical beasts.  After succeeding, in some rather strange ways, Kiyome is attracted to Issei because of how cool he looked during the duel.

The visuals of the characters were designed by Miyama-Zero and their stories were created by [[Ichiei Ishibumi]]. The stories follow the adventures of [[#Issei Hyodo|Issei Hyodo]], a perverted high school guy who is killed by his first date, but reborn as a devil to serve [[Rias Gremory]], a crimson-haired school beauty who heads the {{nihongo|Occult Research Club|\u30aa\u30ab\u30eb\u30c8\u7814\u7a76\u90e8|Okaruto Kenky\u016b-bu}}. Issei, Rias, and the club members interact with various groups and organizations, some of which are run by devils who compete against them in sanctioned combat matches called Rating Games, where the characters have been assigned positions akin to chess pieces.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\nAuthor Ichiei Ishibumi had previously worked on a horror genre series two years before publishing the first light novel for ''High School DxD''. In the volume 1 afterword, he mentions that he changed his writing style, and wanted to develop one in the school-life, love-comedy, battle, and fantasy genre. His main character Issei was made into a lecherous guy at the request of his editor. For the first volume, he made Rias a second lead character and heroine, and Asia to be the second heroine. Some of his characters are loosely referenced from the Bible, non-fiction books, and mythology. He created a world where the war between the three main factions (angels, devils, and fallen angels) is over, and where many famous angels and devils have already ceased to exist. He also added characters and legendary beasts from a variety of places from Norse mythology to Japanese ''[[yokai]]''.{{Ref label|LN 1|LN 1 afterword}} Ishibumi named the Four Great Devils after characters from the ''[[Gundam]]'' media franchise. For example, [[#Sirzechs Lucifer|Sirzechs Lucifer]] is a combination of [[Char Aznable]] and [[Zechs Merquise]], and [[#Millicas|Millicas]] is named after Merquise and Aznable's real names Milliardo and Casval.<ref name=\"sirzechs derivation\">{{cite tweet |author= Ichiei Ishibumi |user= ishibumi_ddd|number= 251842044627136513 |date= September 22, 2012 |title= \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30df\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\uff0b\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30d0\u30eb\u3067\u3059\u3002\u306a\u305c\u306a\u3089\u3001\u7236\u89aa\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30bc\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u540d\u524d\u30cd\u30bf\u304c\u30b7\u30e3\u30a2\uff0b\u30bc\u30af\u30b9\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002 | trans-title=Yes, it is Millardo and Casval.

Angered and disgusted by Marius and the Vampires that made use of Valerie, Gasper's hidden power awakens and he killed Marius and the Vampires that supported him. It is revealed that he was born with a fragment of the consciousness of the original god [[Balor]], and created a different aspect of him, called '''Forbidden Invade Balor the Beast'''. Its power is so great that has the potential to become the 14th Longinus. {{Ref label|LN 16|LN 16}}\n<!--- compress and add references\nIn Volume 11, Gasper goes to the Grigori headquarters to increase his powers. He returns in Volume 12, disappointed that he gained nothing as the Grigori lacked the means to \"trigger\" the next tier of his powers. However, when he heard about Issei's death from Georg who mocked Issei's sacrifice, this caused Gasper to undergo a change where he can create an enormous amount of darkness that literally devours everything (even the mist created by Dimension Lost), which allows him to defeat Georg. During this change, the darkness created was flowing from him and covered everything around him, which could devour anything he wanted it to, including magic attacks, Georg, mist, and even magic circles, although where anything devoured \"went\" is unknown. Anything covered in darkness could also form red eyes from which he could freeze things with Forbidden Balor View. Later in the fight, he turned the shadows into grotesque parodies of creatures like one-eyed wolves and five-winged birds to swarm Georg. The fear of this power was the main reason he was bullied and cast out by his clan, his mixed heritage and Forbidden Balor View were just additional, but more minor, public reasons.\n--->\n<!--\nGasper is a child of a Vampire Lord and a human woman, and thus is hated by many of his own clan, including his siblings, mainly due to the Vampires discriminating which is stronger than the other races. Other than the father being from the Vladi bloodline of Daywalkers, there has been little told about the history or current condition of either. Eventually, he was chased out of his house and was targeted by vampire hunters who killed him. It was around that time Rias found him and, taking pity on the boy, reincarnated him into a Devil through a use of a Bishop Mutation Piece.\n\nAlthough Rias intends on talking to the Vladi clan about this, she is worried that they will continue to refuse to talk to her still and she has few ways of encouraging cooperation. Especially as vampires do not get along well with Devils and have a strict, pure-blooded aristocracy who are so arrogant that not even a single family has ever cared about their servants even a tenth of much as the Gremory family has cared for their servants. Also, any vampire with a human in their parentage, whether humans-turned vampires or are descended from one, are ''never'' allowed to become nobles and considered substandard members of the species, assuming they're even considered vampires in the first place.\n\nAfter a tea party with Valerie, Marius appeared and agreed to Gasper's request to \"free\" Valerie. Gasper later learned the truth to Marius' true purpose and becomes determined to save Valerie. Upon reaching the lowest level of the basement, Gasper was shocked and despaired to see Marius having extracted the Longinus from Valerie as he shares one last conversation before Valerie's \"death\". When the mass-produced Evil Dragons start attacking, Gasper used his darkness to cover the entire town, devouring the mass-produced Evil Dragons before going to assist Issei who was fighting Euclid Lucifuge. Gasper then attempted to attack Rizevim who gives out a retreat order but to no avail due to Rizevim's ability.

Eventually, after the battle with [[Loki]] and [[Fenrir]], Odin leaves her in Issei's town and later gets persuaded by Rias to become her servant, her ranking being \"Rook\" alongside Koneko, and remains in Kuoh Academy as a teacher.\n\nUnlike most of the female characters who already have a crush on Issei, she is still figuring out if she likes him or not. She is extremely bitter on the fact that she does not have a boyfriend and gets angry when she is made fun of for that. Odin uses this several times to knock the wind out of her when she is protesting or interfering with him doing something vulgar. She has a tendency to buy things at sales when they're cheap, allowing Issei to coin for her the nickname {{nihongo|\"The 100-Yen Shop Valkyrie\"|100\u5747\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ad\u30ea\u30fc|}}. This also shows during the Kyoto trip when Issei used dress break on her so he could peep on the female students in the hot springs by her getting mad and lecturing him about destroying her clothes ''before'' getting embarrassed about being naked. She moves into the Hyodo Residence in Volume 8. She left to train with a Norse mage she knows in Volume 11 and returns in Volume 12 after learning new, powerful defensive spells along with how to combine them with the defensive traits of Rook. Thus, gaining enough power to defend against Balance Breakers and even the equivalent of 10x the damage that Heracles' Balance Breaker can create.\n\nIn Volume 14 both the Gremory and Sitri groups are surprised to hear her speak in an unpolished, country voice while talking to her grandmother in her homeland. Also, its noted that part of the reason she is so concerned about money is that she has been sending money over to her grandmother, to help out since the area her hometown is in is described as having nothing and essentially barren. She is currently pursuing two goals, the first is to create a school to teach devils how to become Valkyries, and the second is to open a discount store that carries everything in her homeland. In Volume 17 she asks Issei to pretend to be her boyfriend to convince her grandmother G\u00f6ndul that she is safe in her new life as a devil and as teacher. During her date with Issei, she mentions that when she was a student she wrote an essay that could show a way of sealing the Trihexa (666). Sona invites her to be an expositor at the inauguration of her school and even offers her a position as teacher in a few years. Euclid Lucifuge tries to kidnap her not only for the information, but also because he sees her as a replacement for his sister Grayfia.

As a result, she dreamed of becoming a woman who could become a support for her ideal hero but as she grew older she slowly forgot this dream. Watching Issei fight for the sake of the woman he loves at Riser's engagement party reminded Ravel of her forgotten dream and instilled a desire to understand everything about him.\n\nAs the story develops, she falls in love with him completely, and does not mind becoming his concubine so long as she can be with him. She is currently a \"free\" bishop: her mother (who does not participate in Rating Games) traded one of her unused bishop pieces to Riser for Ravel. She has later traded herself to become one of Issei's Bishops when he has gained peerage, as she wanted to be of use to Issei. She moves into the Hyodo Residence in Volume 10 and enrolls in Kuoh Academy as a first-year student, alongside Koneko and Gasper. She is in Koneko's class at school and despite the two of them bickering often (paying homage to the vitriolic relationship between cats and birds, given their species), they are very close friends. Currently, she is one of Issei's managers (alongside [[#Grayfia Lucifuge|Grayfia]]) and had been tutoring him so that he is able to pass the written part of the exam to become a Middle-Class Devil. During the events of Volume 12, the Phoenix family indicates that not only are they going to allow her to \"stay\" at Issei's house to \"attend school\", they are also hoping that she enters into an intimate relationship with Issei (for various reasons).\n\n===Ophis {{anchor|Ophis}} ===\n{{anime voices|[[Suzuko Mimori]]|[[Megan Shipman]]}}\n\n<!-- Ophis is the spelling as per the Funimation dub.

She organized the [[#Chaos Brigade|Chaos Brigade]] with the hopes of getting rid of [[#Great Red|Great Red]] from the Dimensional Gap. However, she was betrayed by Cao Cao who stole her power under the intention of creating another Ophis, rendering her in a presumed powerless state. Cao Cao, however, underestimated her, as she has released her powers in forms of snakes before Cao Cao came to steal her powers. As such, she did not lose most of her powers. Like Great Red, Ophis does not like to interfere in the matters of the world, having interest only in Great Red. As such, she is more of a figurehead than a leader of the Chaos Brigade, and any plans or acts not pertaining to Great Red were by the will of the members, not hers.\n\nIn Volume 12, she is rescued by Great Red and helped him in restoring Issei's body. The two seem interested in Issei, and both were saying \"Zoom Zoom Iyaaan\" after the battle with the Jabberwocky to Issei and Ddraig's dismay. Although she does not say it, she is probably very fond of Issei, as he is her first friend and had offered her a home in his house in Volume 11. This is a big deal as she had helped protect Asia and Irina later in the volume simply because they had tea and played cards together. According to Issei, Ophis is not evil, just na\u00efve and did not mind being used by the Chaos Brigade, as they had promised to kill Great Red for her. Currently, the faction heads have used numerous seals to hide her presence. This is to avoid upsetting members of their factions and hide her from the remaining members of the Chaos Brigade. Even with the power stolen from her, they are aware that she is too powerful to control, but are allowing her to stay with Issei to encourage the interest she seems to be showing for him. She later moves into the Hyodo Residence at the end of Volume 12 to continue \"observing\" Issei, saying she has a vested interest in him as a part of her was used to recreate Issei's body with Great Red's flesh. Currently, she seems to be welcoming the feeling of having an actual home and friends, even to the point of not attempting to do any significant damage to Great Red other than kicking him during the time she and Issei were riding his back.\n\n==Devils==\n{{nihongo|Devils|\u60aa\u9b54|Akuma}} represent one of the three major supernatural groups (the others being the [[#Fallen angels|fallen angels]] and the [[#Angels|angels]] in a three-way struggle over the control of the world).

Grayfia comes from the House of Lucifuge, a family of pure-blooded Devils from the Extra Demons whose family served under the original Lucifer. She is a Devil on par with the Four Maous, and is known as the \"Strongest Queen\". She once challenged Serafall for the spot of Leviathan. She is nicknamed the {{nihongo foot|Silver-Haired Queen of Devourer|\u9280\u9aea\u306e\u6bb2\u6ec5\u5973\u738b\uff08\u304e\u3093\u3071\u3064\u306e\u30af\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30d0\u30a6\u30a2\uff09|Ginpatsu no Kw\u012bn obu Deibaua|lit. \"Silver-Haired Queen of Annihilation\"|group=lower-alpha}} and uses ice-based magic. For some reason, she does not appreciate having family titles or ties to the Gremory family mentioned while a maid. As a maid, she always acts in a cold, calm, and professional manner with extremely rare instances of emotions showing in her face or voice. This is because when she is a maid she wants to do it completely, which has resulted in her having a relationship with the Gremory family as a maid. One of the few instances she showed emotion was in Volume 2 during her conversation with Issei just before she gave him the magic circle to crash Riser's engagement party and release a griffin to ride home on. She acts and expects to be treated with the difference between a noble and servant, although she still reserves the right to chastise Lucifer and Millicas if they act improper or acknowledge her as part of the family and not a maid or Sirzech's Queen. She enjoys doing small tasks and housework and it seems easier to move around doing simple matters as a maid than the wife of a devil king. Every now and then, she will take a day off as a maid and become a high-class lady who is to be acknowledged as a noble lady of the Gremory Family, Sirzech's wife and Rias' older sister. While maintaining the proper demeanor of a noble lady, she does allow emotions to show on her face and is less reserved around others. So far, she has only been seen to take a day off once in the Extra Life chapter of Volume 8 in the light novels.

Adding to her childlike personality, she calls Sona {{nihongo|\"So-tan\"|\u30bd\u30fc\u305f\u3093|S\u014d-tan}} and refers to others with the \"-chan\" honorific. She is the devil king in charge of foreign affairs (other factions).

Unlike Rias and Sirzechs, Sairaorg did not inherit the Power of Destruction from his lineage.

Misla encourages him to become stronger in other ways, which resulted in him training his body with martial arts, pushing himself to his utmost limits to become powerful.

Since she needed to borrow Issei for an unnamed reason, and the Occult Research Club needed a report on monsters ASAP (Rias has to do the report to earn credits at Demon School, if she's ever short she'll have to return to the Underworld, with her servants, and attend Demon School in person.) As Rias did not want to loan Issei and Abe was wary of them, it was decided to have a tennis match where the winner got what they wanted for free, no strings attached. For the match, Abe used a Harpy (lost) and a Lamia (won) for the two singles games and played doubles with Christie against Rias and Issei for the tie-breaker. Christie's freezing breath was hampering Issei's meager skills so he put on Honda (who was as upset as Issei that Yuki-onna weren't beautiful maidens, but yetis) which help Rias and him win. Later on, she asks Rias if she can borrow Issei to cancel an arranged marriage her father was pushing for.  Rias having escaped an arranged marriage herself agrees, but only if the whole group can come in exchange for some information Kiyome knows about various monsters and mythical beasts.  After succeeding, in some rather strange ways, Kiyome is attracted to Issei because of how cool he looked during the duel.
