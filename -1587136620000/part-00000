Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke leased Donhead Lodge from Baron [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]] in 1803 and Louisa remained in residence there until 1813.{{r|\"JC:Donhead Lodge Release\"}}{{r|DH:30}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of 18th\u201319th century Royal Naval history]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\n{{notelist\n | refs=\n{{efn|name = \"EFN:Baptism\"\n | A number of sources, including T.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]].

He was captured by Alauddin's general [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat Khan]] during the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|1299 invasion of Gujarat]], and rose to prominence in the 1300s.\n\nAs a commander of Alauddin's forces, Kafur defeated the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1306|Mongol invaders in 1306]]. Subsequently, he led a series of expeditions in the southern part of India, against the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|Yadavas]] (1308), the [[Siege of Warangal, 1310|Kakatiyas]] (1310), the [[Siege of Dwarasamudra|Hoysalas]] (1311), and the [[Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom|Pandyas]] (1311). From these campaigns, he brought back many treasures, and many elephants and horses for the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nFrom 1313 to 1315, Kafur served as Alauddin's governor of [[Devagiri]]. When Alauddin fell seriously ill in 1315, Kafur was recalled to Delhi, where he exercised power as ''[[Nawab|Na'ib]]'' ([[viceroy]]). After Alauddin's death, he tried to usurp the power by appointing Alauddin's minor son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin Omar]] as a [[puppet monarch]]. Kafur's [[regency]] lasted for about a month, before he was assassinated by Alauddin's former bodyguards. Alauddin's elder son, [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Mubarak Shah]], succeeded him as regent, and usurped power shortly after.\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\nKafur is described as of [[Hindu]]{{sfn|Hermann Kulke|Dietmar Rothermund|1998|p=160}}{{sfn|Romila Thapar|1990|p=342}}  descent (\"[[Maratha|Marhatta]]\" according to the 14th-century chronicler [[Isami (historian)|Isami]]).{{sfn|S.

But Malik Shahin, governor of [[Chittor Fort]], had fled, fearing a [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] resurgence in the neighbouring territory of [[Gujarat]]. Therefore, Alauddin selected Kafur instead. Alauddin took definite steps to place Kafur above all other officers: The royal canopy and the royal pavilion were sent with him; the officers were directed to pay respects to Kafur every day and to take their orders from him.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=401}} Kafur easily [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|subjugated the Yadavas]], and took Ramachandra to Delhi with rich spoils, where the Yadava king acknowledged Alauddin's [[suzerainty]].{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=192}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=401-402}}{{sfn|S.

He removed several experienced administrators, abolished the office of ''[[vizier|wazir]]'' (prime minister), and even executed the minister Sharaf Qa'ini. It appears that Kafur, who considered these officers as his rivals and a threat, convinced Alauddin to carry out this purge.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}} Alauddin had greater trust in Kafur than other officers because unlike the other officers, Kafur did not have family or followers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=421a|ps=:\"...since Kafur, unlike all other officers, had no family or followers, the Sultan had a greater trust in him.\"}} According to Isami, during the last days of the Alauddin\u2019s reign, Kafur did not allow anyone to see the sultan and became the de facto ruler of the Sultanate.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}}\n\n=== Relationship with Alauddin  ===\n\nKafur was captured by Khalji forces in 1299, and caught the fancy of Alauddin.{{sfn|Shanti Sadiq Ali|1996|p=35a|ps=:\"As a young slave he was snatched away [...] by Nusrat Khan, one of Alauddin's generals, in the year 1299.

Historian [[Banarsi Prasad Saxena|Banarsi Prasad Saksena]] states that during the last years of his reign, Alauddin was infatuated with Kafur but believes that the closeness between the two was not sexual.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=421|ps=:\"During the last four or five years of his reign, Alauddin was infatuated with Malik Naib... There was no element of homosexuality in Alauddin's character; and though Kafur was a eunuch, there was nothing wrong in Alauddin's relations with Kafur, apart from the fact that since Kafur, unlike all other officers, had no family or followers, the Sultan had a greater trust in him.\"}}\n\n=== Murder of Alp Khan ===\n\nKafur's control over the power was threatened by [[Alp Khan]], an influential noble whose two daughters were married to Alauddin's sons Khizr Khan (the [[heir apparent]]) and Shadi Khan. Kafur convinced Alauddin to order the killing of Alp Khan in the royal palace.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}} He also had Khizr Khan first banished from court to [[Amroha]] and then imprisoned in Gwalior, and had Khizr's brother Shadi Khan imprisoned. According to stories that circulated as far as Persia, Khizr Khan, his mother and Alp Khan had hatched a conspiracy to poison Alauddin, so that Khizr Khan could be appointed as the new Sultan, but Alauddin was able to execute them all before he died. This story was corroborated to some extent by Ibn Battuta. The story may just have been Kafur's propaganda.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}}\n\nNext, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers at Alauddin's bedside. At this meeting, Alauddin's 6-year-old son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin]] was declared as the new heir apparent, and it was decided that Kafur would act as his regent after Alauddin's death. According to Isami, Alauddin was too weak to say anything during the meeting, but his silence was taken as his consent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}\n\nThe officers supportive of Kafur included [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din 'Gurg']], whose family came from [[Kabul]]. It appears that Kafur and other officers of non-Turkic origin allied to counter the [[Khalaj people|Khalaj]] establishment of the Sultanate.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=177}}\n\n== As the regent ==\n\nWhen Alauddin died on the night of 4 January 1316, Kafur brought his body from the [[Siri Fort|Siri Palace]] and had it buried in the mausoleum that had already been built before Alauddin's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Ziauddin Barani claims that according to \"some people\", Kafur murdered Alauddin.{{sfn|R. Vanita|S. Kidwai|2000|p=132}}\n\nThe day after Alauddin's death, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers and nobles in the palace, read out a will of the late sultan that named Shihabuddin as his successor while disinheriting Khizr Khan, and then seated Shihabuddin on the throne as the new Sultan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} As the regent, Kafur held the power for a short time (35 days according to Barani, 1 month according to Isami, and 25 days according to [[Firishta]]).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=428}}{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}} During this period, he used to hold a daily ceremonial court in the morning at the [[Siri_Fort#Structure|Hazar Sutun Palace]]. After the short ceremony, Kafur would send Shihabuddin to his mother, and dismiss the courtiers. He would then meet the officers in his chambers on the ground floor, and issue various orders. He ordered the ministries of revenue, secretariat, war and commerce to maintain the laws and regulations established by Alauddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=425-426}} The officers of the ministries were asked to consult Kafur on all policy matters.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nKafur took several actions to maintain his control over the throne. Before burying Alauddin, he had taken the royal ring from the Sultan's finger. He gave this ring to his general Sumbul, asking him to march to [[Gwalior Fort|Gwalior]], and take control of the fort using the ring as a symbol of the royal authority. He asked Sumbul to send the fort's governor to Delhi, and also ordered Sumbul to return to Delhi after blinding Khizr Khan, who had been imprisoned in Gwalior.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Sumbul carried out these orders, and was appointed as ''Amir-i Hijab'' as a reward.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} On his first day as the regent, Kafur also ordered his barber to blind Khizr Khan's uterine brother Shadi Khan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} This incident intensified resentment against Kafur among the Turkic nobles.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} Kafur also deprived Alauddin's [[Malika-i-Jahan (wife of Alauddin Khalji)|senior queen, who bore the title ''Malika-i Jahan'']], of all her property, and later imprisoned her at the Gwalior fort. He also imprisoned [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Mubarak Shah]], another adult son of Alauddin. According to the 16th-century historian [[Firishta]], Kafur married Alauddin's widow Jhatyapalli, the mother of Shihabuddin. Becoming the new Sultan's step-father was probably Kafur's way of legitimizing his power.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nAlp Khan's murder had led to a rebellion in Gujarat, and Kafur had sent [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din 'Gurg']] to suppress it.{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=85}} Meanwhile, Kafur summoned the [[Devagiri]] governor [[Ayn al-Mulk Multani]] to Delhi with all his soldiers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} While Multani was on his way, Kamal al-Din was killed in Gujarat.{{sfn|I. H. Siddiqui|1980|p=105}} Kafur then appointed Multani as the governor of Gujarat, and asked him to march there to suppress the rebellion. The rebellion could be suppressed only after Kafur's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\n== Death ==\n\nThe former bodyguards (''paiks'') of Alauddin disapproved of Kafur's actions against the family of their deceased master. Led by Mubashshir, Bashir, Saleh, and Munir, these bodyguards decided to kill Kafur. When Kafur became suspicious about a conspiracy against him, he summoned Mubashshir to his room. Mubashshir, who was permitted to carry his arms in the royal quarters since Alauddin's days, wounded Kafur with his sword. His associates then entered the room, and beheaded Kafur, also killing 2-3 gatekeepers who attempted to protect Kafur.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=427}} This event took place sometime in February 1316.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}}\n\nAccording to an account mentioned by the 16th-century chronicler [[Firishta]], Kafur had sent some ''paiks'' to blind Mubarak Shah, but the captive prince gave them his jeweled necklace, and convinced them to kill Kafur instead.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=321}} Another legend attributes Kafur's death to his mother's prayers to the mystic Shaikhzada Jam. However, these accounts are latter-day fabrications. According to Barani's near-contemporary account, the ''paiks'' took the initiative to kill Kafur on their own.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=428-429}}\n\nKafur's killers freed Mubarak Shah, who was appointed as the new regent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=427-428}} A few months later, Mubarak Shah usurped the power by blinding Shihabuddin.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|pp=178-179}} Kafur's killers claimed credit for making him the king, and started demanding high positions in the royal court.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} Instead, Mubarak Shah had them executed.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nThe chronicler Barani was severely critical of Kafur but historian [[Abraham Eraly]] believes that Barani's criticism of Kafur is not credible as Barani was deeply prejudiced against Kafur, presumably because of Kafur's non-[[Turkic people|Turkic]], Hindu origins and eunuch status.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=178|ps=:\"Barani is severely critical of Kafur, but his excoriations are not quite credible, for he was deeply prejudiced against Malik Kafur, whom he invariably described as a 'wicked fellow', presumably because he was not a Turk but an Islamised Hindu and a eunuch.\"}}\n\n=== Tomb ===\n\nThe location of Kafur's grave is now unknown, but his [[mausoleum]] existed in the 14th century, when it was repaired by Sultan [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] (r. 1309-1388).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} Firuz Shah's autobiography ''Futuhat-i-Firuzshahi'' states:{{sfn|S.

He was captured by Alauddin's general [[Nusrat Khan Jalesari|Nusrat Khan]] during the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Gujarat|1299 invasion of Gujarat]], and rose to prominence in the 1300s.\n\nAs a commander of Alauddin's forces, Kafur defeated the [[Mongol invasion of India, 1306|Mongol invaders in 1306]]. Subsequently, he led a series of expeditions in the southern part of India, against the [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Devagiri|Yadavas]] (1308), the [[Siege of Warangal, 1310|Kakatiyas]] (1310), the [[Siege of Dwarasamudra|Hoysalas]] (1311), and the [[Malik Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom|Pandyas]] (1311).

There was no element of homosexuality in Alauddin's character; and though Kafur was a eunuch, there was nothing wrong in Alauddin's relations with Kafur, apart from the fact that since Kafur, unlike all other officers, had no family or followers, the Sultan had a greater trust in him.\"}}\n\n=== Murder of Alp Khan ===\n\nKafur's control over the power was threatened by [[Alp Khan]], an influential noble whose two daughters were married to Alauddin's sons Khizr Khan (the [[heir apparent]]) and Shadi Khan. Kafur convinced Alauddin to order the killing of Alp Khan in the royal palace.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}} He also had Khizr Khan first banished from court to [[Amroha]] and then imprisoned in Gwalior, and had Khizr's brother Shadi Khan imprisoned. According to stories that circulated as far as Persia, Khizr Khan, his mother and Alp Khan had hatched a conspiracy to poison Alauddin, so that Khizr Khan could be appointed as the new Sultan, but Alauddin was able to execute them all before he died. This story was corroborated to some extent by Ibn Battuta. The story may just have been Kafur's propaganda.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=176}}\n\nNext, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers at Alauddin's bedside. At this meeting, Alauddin's 6-year-old son [[Shihab-ud-din Omar|Shihabuddin]] was declared as the new heir apparent, and it was decided that Kafur would act as his regent after Alauddin's death. According to Isami, Alauddin was too weak to say anything during the meeting, but his silence was taken as his consent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}\n\nThe officers supportive of Kafur included [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din 'Gurg']], whose family came from [[Kabul]]. It appears that Kafur and other officers of non-Turkic origin allied to counter the [[Khalaj people|Khalaj]] establishment of the Sultanate.{{sfn|Peter Jackson|2003|p=177}}\n\n== As the regent ==\n\nWhen Alauddin died on the night of 4 January 1316, Kafur brought his body from the [[Siri Fort|Siri Palace]] and had it buried in the mausoleum that had already been built before Alauddin's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Ziauddin Barani claims that according to \"some people\", Kafur murdered Alauddin.{{sfn|R. Vanita|S. Kidwai|2000|p=132}}\n\nThe day after Alauddin's death, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers and nobles in the palace, read out a will of the late sultan that named Shihabuddin as his successor while disinheriting Khizr Khan, and then seated Shihabuddin on the throne as the new Sultan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}}{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} As the regent, Kafur held the power for a short time (35 days according to Barani, 1 month according to Isami, and 25 days according to [[Firishta]]).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=428}}{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}} During this period, he used to hold a daily ceremonial court in the morning at the [[Siri_Fort#Structure|Hazar Sutun Palace]]. After the short ceremony, Kafur would send Shihabuddin to his mother, and dismiss the courtiers. He would then meet the officers in his chambers on the ground floor, and issue various orders. He ordered the ministries of revenue, secretariat, war and commerce to maintain the laws and regulations established by Alauddin.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=425-426}} The officers of the ministries were asked to consult Kafur on all policy matters.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nKafur took several actions to maintain his control over the throne. Before burying Alauddin, he had taken the royal ring from the Sultan's finger. He gave this ring to his general Sumbul, asking him to march to [[Gwalior Fort|Gwalior]], and take control of the fort using the ring as a symbol of the royal authority. He asked Sumbul to send the fort's governor to Delhi, and also ordered Sumbul to return to Delhi after blinding Khizr Khan, who had been imprisoned in Gwalior.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} Sumbul carried out these orders, and was appointed as ''Amir-i Hijab'' as a reward.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=425}} On his first day as the regent, Kafur also ordered his barber to blind Khizr Khan's uterine brother Shadi Khan.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} This incident intensified resentment against Kafur among the Turkish nobles.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=177-8}} Kafur also deprived Alauddin's [[Malika-i-Jahan (wife of Alauddin Khalji)|senior queen, who bore the title ''Malika-i Jahan'']], of all her property, and later imprisoned her at the Gwalior fort. He also imprisoned [[Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah|Mubarak Shah]], another adult son of Alauddin. According to the 16th-century historian [[Firishta]], Kafur married Alauddin's widow Jhatyapalli, the mother of Shihabuddin. Becoming the new Sultan's step-father was probably Kafur's way of legitimizing his power.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nAlp Khan's murder had led to a rebellion in Gujarat, and Kafur had sent [[Kamal al-Din Gurg|Kamal al-Din 'Gurg']] to suppress it.{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=85}} Meanwhile, Kafur summoned the [[Devagiri]] governor [[Ayn al-Mulk Multani]] to Delhi with all his soldiers.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} While Multani was on his way, Kamal al-Din was killed in Gujarat.{{sfn|I. H. Siddiqui|1980|p=105}} Kafur then appointed Multani as the governor of Gujarat, and asked him to march there to suppress the rebellion. The rebellion could be suppressed only after Kafur's death.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\n== Death ==\n\nThe former bodyguards (''paiks'') of Alauddin disapproved of Kafur's actions against the family of their deceased master. Led by Mubashshir, Bashir, Saleh, and Munir, these bodyguards decided to kill Kafur. When Kafur became suspicious about a conspiracy against him, he summoned Mubashshir to his room. Mubashshir, who was permitted to carry his arms in the royal quarters since Alauddin's days, wounded Kafur with his sword. His associates then entered the room, and beheaded Kafur, also killing 2-3 gatekeepers who attempted to protect Kafur.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=427}} This event took place sometime in February 1316.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=322}}\n\nAccording to an account mentioned by the 16th-century chronicler [[Firishta]], Kafur had sent some ''paiks'' to blind Mubarak Shah, but the captive prince gave them his jeweled necklace, and convinced them to kill Kafur instead.{{sfn|Kishori Saran Lal|1950|p=321}} Another legend attributes Kafur's death to his mother's prayers to the mystic Shaikhzada Jam. However, these accounts are latter-day fabrications. According to Barani's near-contemporary account, the ''paiks'' took the initiative to kill Kafur on their own.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=428-429}}\n\nKafur's killers freed Mubarak Shah, who was appointed as the new regent.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|pp=427-428}} A few months later, Mubarak Shah usurped the power by blinding Shihabuddin.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|pp=178-179}} Kafur's killers claimed credit for making him the king, and started demanding high positions in the royal court.{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} Instead, Mubarak Shah had them executed.{{sfn|S. Digby|1990|p=419}}{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}}\n\nThe chronicler Barani was severely critical of Kafur but historian [[Abraham Eraly]] believes that Barani's criticism of Kafur is not credible as Barani was deeply prejudiced against Kafur, presumably because of Kafur's non-[[Turkic people|Turkic]], Hindu origins and eunuch status.{{sfn|Abraham Eraly|2015|p=178|ps=:\"Barani is severely critical of Kafur, but his excoriations are not quite credible, for he was deeply prejudiced against Malik Kafur, whom he invariably described as a 'wicked fellow', presumably because he was not a Turk but an Islamised Hindu and a eunuch.\"}}\n\n=== Tomb ===\n\nThe location of Kafur's grave is now unknown, but his [[mausoleum]] existed in the 14th century, when it was repaired by Sultan [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] (r. 1309-1388).{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=426}} Firuz Shah's autobiography ''Futuhat-i-Firuzshahi'' states:{{sfn|S.
