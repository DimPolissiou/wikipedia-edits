Rus\u00edn is a municipality first mentioned in 1262, lying at the easternmost corner of Osobla\u017esko region. Nowadays it has a population of 150 inhabitants in three local districts \u2013 Rus\u00edn, Hrozov\u00e1 and Mat\u011bjovice.\n\nThe village is dominated by the Chapel of the Virgin Mary, located on the Rus\u00edn hill (314 m.s.l.) mainly due to its location and importance for Czech \u2013 Polish and German relations. The chapel with the same name stood there since 1814 but it was destroyed by heavy bombardment at the end of World War II. It was replaced with a replica constructed in 1992-1993 by the impulse of Professor Joseph Scharbert, professor of the theological faculty of Munich University (a classmate of the pope Benedict XVI) and a native of Hrozov\u00e1. Approximately 600 Czechs, Poles and Germans took part in the opening ceremony of the replica chapel on 8 August 1993 and today it is an important pilgrimage place of interest not only for believers but also for tourists as they may enjoy outstanding views from the top of the hill where it is situated. Another way how to spend a free afternoon is to plan a trip from Rus\u00edn to the nearby historical city of [[Glubczyce]] in Poland or just to exercise or relax in a recently newly built sports complex with multifunctional ground.\n\nEven Hrozov\u00e1 has things to offer \u2013 in addition to its lovely rural character there is the Church of St. Michael the Archangel which is a great attraction for tourists. The church was established  probably at the end of the 13th century when the interior gothic was realised. There is one more interesting thing about the church as it is surrounded by a defensive wall from the 15-16th centuries which explains its massive construction. In case of a raid by foreign troops this was the place where local residents took shelter.\nHrozov\u00e1 is also home of the civic association \u201eKr\u00e1lovsk\u00fd stolec\u201c which has significantly contributed to the development of cultural life and rediscovering forgotten traditions of  Osobla\u017esko region.

Rus\u00edn is a municipality first mentioned in 1262, lying at the easternmost corner of Osobla\u017esko region. Nowadays it has a population of 150 inhabitants in three local districts \u2013 Rus\u00edn, Hrozov\u00e1 and Mat\u011bjovice.\n\nThe village is dominated by the Chapel of the Virgin Mary, located on the Rus\u00edn hill (314 m.s.l.) mainly due to its location and importance for Czech \u2013 Polish and German relations. The chapel with the same name stood there since 1814 but it was destroyed by heavy bombardment at the end of World War II. It was replaced with a replica constructed in 1992-1993 by the impulse of Professor Joseph Scharbert, professor of the theological faculty of Munich University (a classmate of the pope Benedict XVI) and a native of Hrozov\u00e1. Approximately 600 Czechs, Poles and Germans took part in the opening ceremony of the replica chapel on 8 August 1993 and today it is an important pilgrimage place of interest not only for believers but also for tourists as they may enjoy outstanding views from the top of the hill where it is situated. Another way how to spend a free afternoon is to plan a trip from Rus\u00edn to the nearby historical city of [[Glubczyce]] in Poland or just to exercise or relax in a recently newly built sports complex with multifunctional ground.\n\nEven Hrozov\u00e1 has things to offer \u2013 in addition to its lovely rural character there is the Church of St. Michael the Archangel which is a great attraction for tourists. The church was established  probably at the end of the 13th century when the interior gothic was realised. There is one more interesting thing about the church as it is surrounded by a defensive wall from the 15-16th centuries which explains its massive construction. In case of a raid by foreign troops this was the place where local residents took shelter.\nHrozov\u00e1 is also home of the civic association \u201eKr\u00e1lovsk\u00fd stolec\u201c which has significantly contributed to the development of cultural life and rediscovering forgotten traditions of  Osobla\u017esko region.
