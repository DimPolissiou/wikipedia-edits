It was premiered on May 10, 1951 by [[Russia]]n horn player [[Valery Polekh]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (later renamed St. Petersburg) with the [[Saint Petersburg Academic Symphony Orchestra|Leningrad Radio Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n==Background==\nPolekh met Gli\u00e8re at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in 1950, during a break in a rehearsal of Gli\u00e8re's ballet ''[[The Bronze Horseman (Gli\u00e8re)|The Bronze Horseman]]''.  During this brief encounter, Polekh suggested that Gliere write a concerto for the horn.  Gliere promised he would work on a concerto in his free time.  Polekh later met with Gli\u00e8re and demonstrated the capabilities of the horn to him; a year later, Gli\u00e8re finished writing the concerto.\n\nThe Horn Concerto is perhaps the best known of Gli\u00e8re's acclaimed works. The addition of valves in the early 19th century allowed composers a greater flexibility in their compositions, and the horn became a full range solo instrument. Many composers, valuing its large range and unique tone, incorporated it more prominently in their compositions. \n\n==Structure==\nDespite being composed in the 1950s, the concerto is written in a [[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] style with strong [[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] influences. Three movements comprise the concerto:\n\n* I. Allegro\n* II. Andante\n* III. Moderato - Allegro vivace\n\nThe standard [[cadenza]] played with the concerto was written by [[Valery Polekh]], the first to perform the concerto.  Polekh's cadenza is very much in the style of the concerto, and its virtuosic demands far exceed the majority of the piece.  Because of this, many horn players prefer to modify this standard cadenza, while still more write their own; some horn players, however, play the exact cadenza written by Polekh.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Discography==\nOne of the major works in the horn repertoire, the concerto has been recorded a number of times.\n\nGiven its duration (roughly 22 minutes) it is quite common to find this Horn Concerto on the same CD with other horn concerti, or Gli\u00e8re's ballet ''The Bronze Horseman''.\n\nThe foremost example is probably [[Eric Ruske]]'s 2005 recording performed with the IRIS Chamber Orchestra, conducted by [[Michael Stern (conductor)|Michael Stern]]. Ruske plays Polekh's cadenza with slight variations.\n\nAnother recording of particular note is [[Marie Luise Neunecker]]'s recording with the [[Bamberg Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Werner Andreas Albert]]. Neunecker performs Polekh's cadenza.\n\nIn the [[Hermann Baumann (musician)|Hermann Baumann]] recording with the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]] conducted by [[Kurt Masur]], Baumann does not play Polekh's cadenza, but wrote his own.\n\nA lesser known recording, though highly reviewed, is [[Eliz Erkalp]]'s recording with the [[Royal Flemish Philharmonic]], [[Marc Soustrot]] conducting.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.hornsociety.org/en/component/content/article/27-online-articles/144-birth-of-the-gliere-concerto Article written by Valery Polekh regarding the Gli\u00e8re Concerto]\n*[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classRev/2007/Dec07/Gliere_DOM292996.htm CD review by Rob Barnett]\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/concerto-for-horn-orchestra-in-b-flat-op-91 CD review attributed to All Music Guide]\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn Concerto (Gliere)}}\n[[Category:Horn concertos|Gliere]]\n[[Category:Compositions by Reinhold Gli\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:1951 compositions]]\n[[Category:Compositions in B-flat major]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[Reinhold Gli\u00e8re]]'s '''Concerto for Horn and Orchestra in B-flat major''', Op. 91, was completed in 1951.

The family moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1823.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|id=18265|first=David|last=Maskell|title=Maskell, William}}</ref> He matriculated on 9 June 1832 at University College, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1836, and M.A. in 1838, having taken [[holy orders]] in 1837.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Maskell, William|volume=36}}</ref>\n\nFrom an extreme [[High Church]] position, Maskell attacked in 1840 [[Edward Stanley (bishop)|Edward Stanley]], a [[latitudinarian]], over subscription to the [[Thirty Nine Articles]]. His father William died in 1841.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1842 he was instituted to the rectory of [[Corscombe]], Dorset, and concentrated on research into the history of Anglican ritual. Having resigned Corscombe, he was instituted in 1847 to the vicarage of [[St Mary Church, Torquay]], and appointed domestic chaplain to [[Henry Phillpotts]], the [[Bishop of Exeter]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFor Phillpotts, Maskell conducted the examination of [[George Cornelius Gorham]] on his views of [[baptism]], when Gorham was being considered for presentation to the vicarage of [[Brampford Speke]], near Exeter. The Gorham case was escalated through the courts to the Privy Council. Soon afterwards Maskell resigned his living, and was received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nNot taking Catholic orders, and indeed unable to do so after his second marriage in 1852, Maskell spent his later life in retirement in [[Bude]], Cornwall. His father's fortune allowed him to retire.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Robert Stephen Hawker]], a good friend, was nearby with the living at [[Morwenstow]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Frederick George |title=Memorials of ...

He had a large library of [[patristic literature]], and collected medieval [[Liturgical book|service book]]s, enamels and carvings in ivory; and made museum donations. He was a [[Justice of the Peace]], and a deputy-lieutenant for [[Cornwall]]. He died at [[Penzance]] on 12 April 1890.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Views==\nMaskell's views of baptism and the [[Eucharist]] were set out in his 1849 volume of sermons. A believer in the Catholic doctrine of the [[immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary]], Maskell regretted its definition by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854.

In the films, Thanos seeks to collect all six [[Infinity Stones]] in an effort to \"balance\" the universe by stabilizing its overpopulation. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] join forces to combat him.\n\nThe main [[antagonist]] of the \"Infinity Saga\" of the MCU, Thanos appeared in five films, from his introduction in a post-credit scene in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', up to ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The character received praise from critics and fans alike, and has been described as \"hands down\" the best villain of the MCU<ref name=\"VillainRank\" /> as well as one of the greatest film antagonists of the [[2010s in film|2010s]].<ref>https://whatculture.com/film/15-best-movie-villains-of-the-decade?page=13</ref><ref>https://screenrant.com/best-movie-villains-of-the-decade/</ref><ref>https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/best-movie-villains-21st-century-indiewire-critics-survey-1202048559/</ref>\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[Jim Starlin]] conceived Thanos during a college [[psychology]] course, and he introduced the character in a 1973 edition of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Starlin originally designed the character as skinny and lanky, but editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested he \"beef him up.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Jim Starlin |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |website=Adelaide Comics and Books |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and invulnerability among other qualities.\n\nThe MCU began building towards Thanos in the first ''Avengers'' film, in which [[Damion Poitier]] portrayed the character in an uncredited cameo appearance.<ref>https://screenrant.com/marvel-thanos-recast-after-avengers-josh-brolin-reason/</ref> In May 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] signed a multi-film contract to portray the antagonist, debuting in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in ''Guardians'', but [[Joss Whedon]] felt that the character needed to be threaded more gently.<ref name=\"HitFix\"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] noted that Thanos' lingering presence in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to ''Infinity War''. Despite this, little screen time had been devoted to Thanos' history and motivations. Markus stated, \"We don't get an element of surprise [with his introduction in ''Infinity War'']...

McFeely explained \"we had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain [...] You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\"<ref name=\"26Spoilers\" /> Joe Russo stated that after Thanos was successful in ''Avengers: Infinity War'', he is now \"done.

This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers instead chose to pair the character with Gamora and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice  by noting \"[Thanos and Gamora] had a lot of history we wanted to explore\" that would add layers to Thanos and would avoid him becoming \"the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Avengers: Infinity War: How They Decided to Split Up the Characters |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |website=Vulture |language=en-us |date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in ''The Avengers'' with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death. Though the tease was purposely ambiguous, Whedon felt when he featured Thanos he did not know what to do with him and \"kind of hung [Thanos] out to dry\". Whedon added that \"I love Thanos. I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power. But, I don't really understand it.\" Whedon enjoyed the approach the writers and Russos took in ''Infinity War'', giving Thanos \"an actual perspective and [making] him feel righteous to himself\", since the Death storyline was \"not a concept that will necessarily translate\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evangelista |first1=Chris |title=Joss Whedon Admits He Didn't Know What to Do With Thanos |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |website=Slash Film |date=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Design and special effects===\nDigital Domain worked on creating Thanos for ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', producing over 400 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The company created a new facial capture [[Application software|application]] called Masquerade, based on the concept of [[machine learning]] through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3\u20134 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin how to portray the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\">{{cite web |last1=Seymour |first1=Mike |title=Making Thanos Face the Avengers |url=https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |website=fxguide |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Before the start of filming, Brolin's facial expressions were captured with ILM's Medusa system, which along with his motion capture data from set, were fed to Masquerade to \"create a higher-resolution version of what Brolin did on set\" so animators could apply that to the CGI character. Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films, but were adjusted more toward's Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.<ref name=hollywoodreporter/>\n\n==Marvel Cinematic Universe==\n===Appearances===\n{{further|The Avengers (2012 film)|Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* Thanos had minor roles in his first few appearances in the MCU, including two post-credit scene cameo appearances in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''<ref name=\"TheAvengers\" /> and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''<ref name=\"AAoU\" />.\n* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''<ref name=\"GotG\" />, Thanos appears in a supporting role. In the film, he tasks [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] with tracking down the Power Stone on his behalf. Once obtained, Thanos plans to repay Ronan by destroying Xandar. However, Ronan betrays Thanos and keeps the stone for himself, ultimately resulting in his death at the hands of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].\n* Thanos serves as the primary antagonist of both ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', in which he sets out to collect all six infinity stones.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Long plot|section|date=April 2020}}\n===Early life===\nBorn and raised on the planet Titan, Thanos had an unwavering love for his home and its people. As Titan grew overpopulated and began running low on natural resources, Thanos worried about his planet's lifespan. In an effort to save the planet, Thanos suggested killing half the population at random so that the other half could prosper. The people of Titan rejected this idea and banished Thanos, labeling him a madman. However, Thanos' worries proved valid as Titan crumbled over time and Thanos' race went extinct, leaving him as its sole survivor. Fearing what happened to Titan would occur elsewhere, Thanos dedicated his life to \"balancing\" the universe by destroying half of all life for the benefit of the other half.\n\nThe Mad Titan amassed an army and began conquering planets, causing his reputation to quickly spread throughout the galaxy. To further build his strength, Thanos adopted children that were orphaned during the conquering of their home planet. He ultimately adopted six children; [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Cull Obsidian]], [[Ebony Maw]], [[Proxima Midnight]], [[Nebula]], and [[Gamora]]. During his children's training, Thanos always pit Nebula and Gamora against each other, and Gamora's consistent victories caused her to become Thanos' favorite child. Conversely, he grew disappointed in Nebula, and every time she'd lose he would replace a part of her body with machinery in an effort to improve her fighting.\n\n===Growing interest in the Infinity Stones===\nAs time passed Thanos discovered the most efficient way to bring balance to the universe would be with the use of the Infinity Stones, six all-powerful gems that grant their wielder god-like abilities. Thanos made it his mission to acquire these stones, first by proxy and eventually on his own volition.\nAt the behest of Thanos, The Other, leader of the Chitauri, tasked [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] with collecting the Space Stone, located within the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. In exchange for the stone, Thanos and The Other agree to give Loki an army of Chitauri. However, the Avengers apprehend Loki, and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] takes the Tesseract to [[Asgard]] for safe keeping. Thanos then turns his attention to the Power Stone, which is inside an Orb on the planet Morag. Thanos strikes a bargain with [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] similar to his deal with Loki; in exchange for the Orb, Thanos will grant Ronan an army with which he can destroy the planet [[Xandar]]. Before Ronan can get the Orb it is captured by [[Peter Quill]], leading Thanos to task Gamora with re-claiming it. Unbeknownst to them, Gamora had been planning to betray them by turning the stone over to [[The Collector]]. When Ronan relays the news of Gamora's betrayal, Thanos scolds him for his disrespect and blames him for \"alienating [his] favorite daughter.\" He then assigns Nebula to take Gamora's place at Ronan's side.\n\nMeanwhile, Gamora and Quill join forces alongside [[Rocket Raccoon]], [[Groot]], and [[Drax the Destroyer]] to form the Guardians of the Galaxy. The group decides to take the Power Stone to the [[Nova Corps]] on Xandar for safe keeping, but before they can Ronan and his forces take it from them. When Thanos contacts Ronan for an update, he discovers that Ronan, having experienced the true capability of the Power Stone, intends to keep it for himself, and Nebula sides with him over her adopted father. Unphased, Thanos cuts contact with them without a word. Ronan is eventually killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who then give the Power Stone to the Nova Corps, leaving another stone lost to Thanos.\n\n===Assembling the stones===\nAfter both Loki and Ronan failed, Thanos decides to assemble the Infinity Stones himself. He begins by traveling to Nidavellir, a planet of blacksmith Dwarves, and forcing them to build him a gauntlet capable of channeling all six Infinity Stones. Once they had done so, Thanos proceeded to exterminate the entire population save [[Eitri]], who's hands Thanos smelted in metal. With the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] now in hand, Thanos seeks out the Stones.\n\nHe begins on Xandar, using his army to decimate the planet, claim the Power Stone from the Nova Corps, and kill half of all Xandarians. Next, he uses his ship, the Sanctuary II, to track down the starship carrying the Asgardian survivors of the [[Thor: Ragnarok|Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thanos and his remaining children, collectively known as the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], board the ship and kill half the remaining Asgardians. In the aftermath of the slaughter, Thanos personally defeats the [[Hulk]] in hand-to-combat and kills Heimdall. He takes the Space Stone from Loki and kills him, the leaves Thor to die.\n\nThanos orders his children to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones from Earth while he heads to Knowhere to get the Reality Stone from the Collector. Quill, Gamora, Drax and [[Mantis (comics)|Mantis]] attempt to stop him, but Thanos foils them via his newly acquired Reality Stone. Aware that Gamora knows the location of Soul Stone, he captures her and takes her aboard the Sanctuary II. There, Thanos reveals he has captured Nebula; she had snuck aboard his ship to assassinate him but failed. Thanos tortures Nebula until Gamora reveals the location of the Soul Stone, Vormir. He and Gamora travel to Vormir, and while they are gone Nebula escapes the ship. On Vormir, Thanos and Gamora encounter [[Red Skull]], keeper of the Soul Stone. Red Skull tells Thanos that the only way to acquire the Soul Stone is to sacrifice someone you love. Upon hearing this Gamora mocked Thanos, claiming he loves nothing. However, Thanos truly loved Gamora as his daughter, and unwilling to give up his quest for balance, he makes the sacrifice; he hurls Gamora off a cliff, killing her and granting him the Soul Stone.\n\nThanos returns to Titan to rendezvous with Ebony Maw, only to discover that Maw is dead and [[Doctor Strange]] awaits him. After detailing the extinction of his home planet, Thanos explains to Strange that with all six stones he will simply snap his fingers and half of all life in the universe would cease to exist. Thanos considers this mercy, and once the task is completed he will rest and watch the sunrise on a \"grateful\" universe. To prevent this, Strange engages Thanos along with [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], Quill, Drax and Mantis, with Nebula later joining the fight. The heroes are able to overpower Thanos and Mantis puts him to sleep, allowing them access to the Gauntlet. But upon learning of Gamora's death, Quill is unable to control his emotions and attacks Thanos, causing Mantis to lose her grip on the Mad Titan. Freed from the trance, Thanos brutally attacks the group, defeating them one by one until only Stark remained. Despite his insistence that the Time Stone took precedent over any of the Avengers' lives, Doctor Strange agrees to give Thanos the Time Stone if he spares Stark's life. With five of the six Stones claimed, Thanos heads to Wakanda to collect the Mind Stone.\n\nIn Wakanda, [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] has been leading a defense against the Black Order and Thanos' army to prevent them from getting the Mind Stone located in [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s head. Thanos arrives in Wakanda, and his nearly completed Gauntlet allows him to effortlessly defeats Rogers and his allies. To prevent him from retrieving the final stone, [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] is forced to destroy Vision to eliminate the stone. Thanos takes pity on Wanda, but nevertheless uses the Time Stone to undo Vision's destruction and rip the Mind Stone out of his head, completing the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\n===The Snap===\nAs the power of the Infinity Stones surges through Thanos' body, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] makes one last charge at him, stabbing him in the chest with [[Stormbreaker]]. Although Thanos appears to be mortally wounded, he survives the attack and jeers Thor, stating he \"should've gone for the head.\" Thanos then snaps his fingers and the Infinity Stones grant him his desire; half of all life in the universe disintegrates without warning.\nAmidst the ensuing chaos, Thanos uses the Space Stone to transport to an uninhabited farming planet called the Garden. There he watches the sunrise, satisfied in having completed his objective.\n\n===Aftermath and undoing===\nThree weeks after the snap, a faction of the surviving Avengers pinpoint Thanos' location. The Avengers arrive at the Garden and attack him. They find the gauntlet fused to his hand, and he reveals that he used the stones to destroy the stones themselves, preventing anyone from reversing his actions. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\nFive years later, [[Scott Lang]] escapes the Quantum Realm. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm could be used for [[time travel]], Lang, Rodgers and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] ask Stark to help them go back in time, retrieve the stones, and reverse the damage Thanos has done. After initially refusing, Stark relents and helps the surviving Avengers, including Nebula. She and [[War Machine]] travel to Morag in 2014 to capture the Power Stone. Although the pair successfully get the stone, Nebula's cybernetics begin to overlap with her 2014 counterpart. This Nebula's malfunctions are witnessed by the Thanos of 2014, and he exploits it deduce the Avengers' plan to undo his future success.\n\nThanos captures future-Nebula and sends 2014 Nebula to the future so that she can transport him and his army there. She does so, and Thanos arrives just as Banner uses the gathered stones to restore those who were decimated. After his warship fires on the Avengers compound, Thanos tells Stark, Rodgers, and Thor that he now realizes destroying half of all life isn't good enough. Now Thanos plans to use the stones to destroy the entire universe and remake it in his image. The three attack Thanos, but he overpowers them. Before Thanos can finish them off, the recently revived [[Stephen Strange]] arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos and his army.\n\nThe Avengers fight to prevent Thanos from getting the gauntlet, and [[Carol Danvers]] is able to destroy his warship. However, Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Thanos once again snaps his fingers, but he is shocked to discover that Stark stole the stones from him. Stark snaps his fingers, disintegrating the army and wiping out Thanos once and for all.\n\n==Reception==\nThe MCU's rendition of Thanos has received critical acclaim. [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called Brolin's performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gleiberman |first1=Owen |title=Film Review: 'Avengers: Infinity War' |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/avengers-infinity-war-review-robert-downey-jr-chadwick-boseman-1202782256/ |website=Variety |language=en |date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> [[Todd McCarthy]] echoed this sentiment, saying \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Todd |title='Avengers: Infinity War': Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/avengers-infinity-war-review-1105484 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''[[IGN]]'', Scott Collua pointed out that audiences \"understand his perspective and believe his pain\", making the antagonist surprisingly sympathetic.<ref name=\"ignreview\">{{cite web |last1=Collura |first1=Scott |title=Avengers: Infinity War Review - IGN |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/18/avengers-infinity-war-review |website=IGN |date=May 18, 2018}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised both the character and Brolin: \"[Thanos is] thunderously voiced by a dynamite Josh Brolin in a motion-capture performance that radiates ferocity and unexpected feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=Travers on 'Avengers: Infinity War': Marvel Team-Up Is Superhero Pile-Up |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/avengers-infinity-war-review-all-star-marvel-team-up-is-superhero-pile-up-628954/ |website=Rolling Stone |date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called Thanos an \"unexpectedly resonant monster, filled with sadness and even a perverse sense of honor.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Orr |first1=Christopher |title='Avengers: Infinity War' Is an Extraordinary Juggling Act |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-review/558983/ |website=The Atlantic |date=April 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCritics noted that Thanos was a significant improvement over previous antagonists in the franchise.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guerrasio |first1=Jason |title=Thanks to Thanos, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is Marvel's 'The Empire Strikes Back' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/avengers-infinity-war-is-marvel-empire-strikes-back-because-of-thanos-2018-4 |website=Business Insider |date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> According to ''[[Screen Rant]]'', the MCU struggled to create captivating antagonists throughout its first two phases.

Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character of the [[Thanos|same name]]. In the films, Thanos seeks to collect all six [[Infinity Stones]] in an effort to \"balance\" the universe by stabilizing its overpopulation. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] join forces to combat him.\n\nThe main [[antagonist]] of the \"Infinity Saga\" of the MCU, Thanos appeared in five films, from his introduction in a post-credit scene in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', up to ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The character received praise from critics and fans alike, and has been described as \"hands down\" the best villain of the MCU<ref name=\"VillainRank\" /> as well as one of the greatest film antagonists of the [[2010s in film|2010s]].<ref>https://whatculture.com/film/15-best-movie-villains-of-the-decade?page=13</ref><ref>https://screenrant.com/best-movie-villains-of-the-decade/</ref><ref>https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/best-movie-villains-21st-century-indiewire-critics-survey-1202048559/</ref>\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[Jim Starlin]] conceived Thanos during a college [[psychology]] course, and he introduced the character in a 1973 edition of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Starlin originally designed the character as skinny and lanky, but editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested he \"beef him up.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Jim Starlin |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |website=Adelaide Comics and Books |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and invulnerability among other qualities.\n\nThe MCU began building towards Thanos in the first ''Avengers'' film, in which [[Damion Poitier]] portrayed the character in an uncredited cameo appearance.<ref>https://screenrant.com/marvel-thanos-recast-after-avengers-josh-brolin-reason/</ref> In May 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] signed a multi-film contract to portray the antagonist, debuting in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in ''Guardians'', but [[Joss Whedon]] felt that the character needed to be threaded more gently.<ref name=\"HitFix\"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] noted that Thanos' lingering presence in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to ''Infinity War''.

This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers instead chose to pair the character with Gamora and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice  by noting \"[Thanos and Gamora] had a lot of history we wanted to explore\" that would add layers to Thanos and would avoid him becoming \"the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Avengers: Infinity War: How They Decided to Split Up the Characters |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |website=Vulture |language=en-us |date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in ''The Avengers'' with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death.

I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power.

Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films, but were adjusted more toward's Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.<ref name=hollywoodreporter/>\n\n==Marvel Cinematic Universe==\n===Appearances===\n{{further|The Avengers (2012 film)|Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* Thanos had minor roles in his first few appearances in the MCU, including two post-credit scene cameo appearances in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''<ref name=\"TheAvengers\" /> and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''<ref name=\"AAoU\" />.\n* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''<ref name=\"GotG\" />, Thanos appears in a supporting role. In the film, he tasks [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] with tracking down the Power Stone on his behalf. Once obtained, Thanos plans to repay Ronan by destroying Xandar. However, Ronan betrays Thanos and keeps the stone for himself, ultimately resulting in his death at the hands of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].\n* Thanos serves as the primary antagonist of both ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', in which he sets out to collect all six infinity stones.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Long plot|section|date=April 2020}}\n===Early life===\nBorn and raised on the planet Titan, Thanos had an unwavering love for his home and its people. As Titan grew overpopulated and began running low on natural resources, Thanos worried about his planet's lifespan. In an effort to save the planet, Thanos suggested killing half the population at random so that the other half could prosper. The people of Titan rejected this idea and banished Thanos, labeling him a madman. However, Thanos' worries proved valid as Titan crumbled over time and Thanos' race went extinct, leaving him as its sole survivor. Fearing what happened to Titan would occur elsewhere, Thanos dedicated his life to \"balancing\" the universe by destroying half of all life for the benefit of the other half.\n\nThe Mad Titan amassed an army and began conquering planets, causing his reputation to quickly spread throughout the galaxy. To further build his strength, Thanos adopted children that were orphaned during the conquering of their home planet. He ultimately adopted six children; [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Cull Obsidian]], [[Ebony Maw]], [[Proxima Midnight]], [[Nebula]], and [[Gamora]]. During his children's training, Thanos always pit Nebula and Gamora against each other, and Gamora's consistent victories caused her to become Thanos' favorite child. Conversely, he grew disappointed in Nebula, and every time she'd lose he would replace a part of her body with machinery in an effort to improve her fighting.\n\n===Growing interest in the Infinity Stones===\nAs time passed Thanos discovered the most efficient way to bring balance to the universe would be with the use of the Infinity Stones, six all-powerful gems that grant their wielder god-like abilities. Thanos made it his mission to acquire these stones, first by proxy and eventually on his own volition.\nAt the behest of Thanos, The Other, leader of the Chitauri, tasked [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] with collecting the Space Stone, located within the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. In exchange for the stone, Thanos and The Other agree to give Loki an army of Chitauri. However, the Avengers apprehend Loki, and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] takes the Tesseract to [[Asgard]] for safe keeping. Thanos then turns his attention to the Power Stone, which is inside an Orb on the planet Morag. Thanos strikes a bargain with [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] similar to his deal with Loki; in exchange for the Orb, Thanos will grant Ronan an army with which he can destroy the planet [[Xandar]]. Before Ronan can get the Orb it is captured by [[Peter Quill]], leading Thanos to task Gamora with re-claiming it. Unbeknownst to them, Gamora had been planning to betray them by turning the stone over to [[The Collector]]. When Ronan relays the news of Gamora's betrayal, Thanos scolds him for his disrespect and blames him for \"alienating [his] favorite daughter.\" He then assigns Nebula to take Gamora's place at Ronan's side.\n\nMeanwhile, Gamora and Quill join forces alongside [[Rocket Raccoon]], [[Groot]], and [[Drax the Destroyer]] to form the Guardians of the Galaxy. The group decides to take the Power Stone to the [[Nova Corps]] on Xandar for safe keeping, but before they can Ronan and his forces take it from them. When Thanos contacts Ronan for an update, he discovers that Ronan, having experienced the true capability of the Power Stone, intends to keep it for himself, and Nebula sides with him over her adopted father. Unphased, Thanos cuts contact with them without a word. Ronan is eventually killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who then give the Power Stone to the Nova Corps, leaving another stone lost to Thanos.\n\n===Assembling the stones===\nAfter both Loki and Ronan failed, Thanos decides to assemble the Infinity Stones himself. He begins by traveling to Nidavellir, a planet of blacksmith Dwarves, and forcing them to build him a gauntlet capable of channeling all six Infinity Stones. Once they had done so, Thanos proceeded to exterminate the entire population save [[Eitri]], who's hands Thanos smelted in metal. With the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] now in hand, Thanos seeks out the Stones.\n\nHe begins on Xandar, using his army to decimate the planet, claim the Power Stone from the Nova Corps, and kill half of all Xandarians. Next, he uses his ship, the Sanctuary II, to track down the starship carrying the Asgardian survivors of the [[Thor: Ragnarok|Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thanos and his remaining children, collectively known as the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], board the ship and kill half the remaining Asgardians. In the aftermath of the slaughter, Thanos personally defeats the [[Hulk]] in hand-to-combat and kills Heimdall. He takes the Space Stone from Loki and kills him, the leaves Thor to die.\n\nThanos orders his children to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones from Earth while he heads to Knowhere to get the Reality Stone from the Collector. Quill, Gamora, Drax and [[Mantis (comics)|Mantis]] attempt to stop him, but Thanos foils them via his newly acquired Reality Stone. Aware that Gamora knows the location of Soul Stone, he captures her and takes her aboard the Sanctuary II. There, Thanos reveals he has captured Nebula; she had snuck aboard his ship to assassinate him but failed. Thanos tortures Nebula until Gamora reveals the location of the Soul Stone, Vormir. He and Gamora travel to Vormir, and while they are gone Nebula escapes the ship. On Vormir, Thanos and Gamora encounter [[Red Skull]], keeper of the Soul Stone. Red Skull tells Thanos that the only way to acquire the Soul Stone is to sacrifice someone you love. Upon hearing this Gamora mocked Thanos, claiming he loves nothing. However, Thanos truly loved Gamora as his daughter, and unwilling to give up his quest for balance, he makes the sacrifice; he hurls Gamora off a cliff, killing her and granting him the Soul Stone.\n\nThanos returns to Titan to rendezvous with Ebony Maw, only to discover that Maw is dead and [[Doctor Strange]] awaits him. After detailing the extinction of his home planet, Thanos explains to Strange that with all six stones he will simply snap his fingers and half of all life in the universe would cease to exist. Thanos considers this mercy, and once the task is completed he will rest and watch the sunrise on a \"grateful\" universe. To prevent this, Strange engages Thanos along with [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], Quill, Drax and Mantis, with Nebula later joining the fight. The heroes are able to overpower Thanos and Mantis puts him to sleep, allowing them access to the Gauntlet. But upon learning of Gamora's death, Quill is unable to control his emotions and attacks Thanos, causing Mantis to lose her grip on the Mad Titan. Freed from the trance, Thanos brutally attacks the group, defeating them one by one until only Stark remained. Despite his insistence that the Time Stone took precedent over any of the Avengers' lives, Doctor Strange agrees to give Thanos the Time Stone if he spares Stark's life. With five of the six Stones claimed, Thanos heads to Wakanda to collect the Mind Stone.\n\nIn Wakanda, [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] has been leading a defense against the Black Order and Thanos' army to prevent them from getting the Mind Stone located in [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s head. Thanos arrives in Wakanda, and his nearly completed Gauntlet allows him to effortlessly defeats Rogers and his allies. To prevent him from retrieving the final stone, [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] is forced to destroy Vision to eliminate the stone. Thanos takes pity on Wanda, but nevertheless uses the Time Stone to undo Vision's destruction and rip the Mind Stone out of his head, completing the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\n===The Snap===\nAs the power of the Infinity Stones surges through Thanos' body, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] makes one last charge at him, stabbing him in the chest with [[Stormbreaker]]. Although Thanos appears to be mortally wounded, he survives the attack and jeers Thor, stating he \"should've gone for the head.\" Thanos then snaps his fingers and the Infinity Stones grant him his desire; half of all life in the universe disintegrates without warning.\nAmidst the ensuing chaos, Thanos uses the Space Stone to transport to an uninhabited farming planet called the Garden. There he watches the sunrise, satisfied in having completed his objective.\n\n===Aftermath and undoing===\nThree weeks after the snap, a faction of the surviving Avengers pinpoint Thanos' location. The Avengers arrive at the Garden and attack him. They find the gauntlet fused to his hand, and he reveals that he used the stones to destroy the stones themselves, preventing anyone from reversing his actions. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\nFive years later, [[Scott Lang]] escapes the Quantum Realm. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm could be used for [[time travel]], Lang, Rodgers and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] ask Stark to help them go back in time, retrieve the stones, and reverse the damage Thanos has done. After initially refusing, Stark relents and helps the surviving Avengers, including Nebula. She and [[War Machine]] travel to Morag in 2014 to capture the Power Stone. Although the pair successfully get the stone, Nebula's cybernetics begin to overlap with her 2014 counterpart. This Nebula's malfunctions are witnessed by the Thanos of 2014, and he exploits it deduce the Avengers' plan to undo his future success.\n\nThanos captures future-Nebula and sends 2014 Nebula to the future so that she can transport him and his army there. She does so, and Thanos arrives just as Banner uses the gathered stones to restore those who were decimated. After his warship fires on the Avengers compound, Thanos tells Stark, Rodgers, and Thor that he now realizes destroying half of all life isn't good enough. Now Thanos plans to use the stones to destroy the entire universe and remake it in his image. The three attack Thanos, but he overpowers them. Before Thanos can finish them off, the recently revived [[Stephen Strange]] arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos and his army.\n\nThe Avengers fight to prevent Thanos from getting the gauntlet, and [[Carol Danvers]] is able to destroy his warship. However, Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Thanos once again snaps his fingers, but he is shocked to discover that Stark stole the stones from him. Stark snaps his fingers, disintegrating the army and wiping out Thanos once and for all.\n\n==Reception==\nThe MCU's rendition of Thanos has received critical acclaim.

{"title_page": "World War I reparations", "text_new": "{{Paris Peace Conference sidebox|expanded=Treaty of Versailles}}\n\n''World War I reparations'' were [[war reparations]] imposed during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] upon the [[Central Powers]] following their defeat in the [[World War I|First World War]] by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associate Powers]]. Each of the defeated powers were required to make payments in either cash or kind. Because of the financial situation [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungary]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] found themselves in after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw its reparation figure reduced and then cancelled. Historians have recognized the [[Weimar Republic|German]] requirement to pay reparations as the \"chief battleground of the post-war era\" and \"the focus of the power struggle between [[French Third Republic|France]] and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised\".{{sfn|Henig|1995|p=63}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] (signed in 1919) and the 1921 London Schedule of Payments required Germany to pay 132&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark|gold marks]] {{nowrap|({{USD|33 billion}})}} in reparations to cover civilian damage caused during the war. This figure was divided into three categories of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]: A, B, and C. Of these, Germany was required to pay towards 'A' and 'B' bonds totaling 50&nbsp;billion marks ({{USD|12.5 billion}}) unconditionally. The payment of the remaining 'C' bonds was interest free and contingent on the Weimar Republic's ability to pay, as was to be assessed by an Allied committee.\n\nDue to the lack of reparation payments by Germany, France pornhub is great [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] in 1923 to enforce payments, causing an international crisis that resulted in the implementation of the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924. This plan outlined a new payment method and raised international loans to help Germany to meet its reparation commitments. Despite this, by 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the [[Young Plan]] that established the German reparation requirements at 112&nbsp;billion marks ({{USD|26.3 billion}}) and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were [[Hoover Moratorium|suspended for a year]] and in 1932 during the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]] they were cancelled altogether. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21&nbsp;billion marks in reparations.\n\nThe German people saw reparations as a national humiliation; the German Government worked to undermine the validity of the Treaty of Versailles and the requirement to pay. British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] called the treaty a [[Carthaginian peace]] that would economically destroy Germany. His arguments had a profound effect on historians, politicians, and the public at large. Despite Keynes' arguments and those by later historians supporting or reinforcing Keynes' views, the consensus of contemporary historians is that reparations were not as intolerable as the Germans or Keynes had suggested and were within Germany's capacity to pay had there been the political will to do so. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[West Germany]] took up payments. The 1953 [[London Agreement on German External Debts]] resulted in an agreement to pay 50 per cent of the remaining balance. The final payment was made on 3 October 2010, settling German loan debts in regard to reparations.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:A view of the ruins of Avocourt, situated just behind the American trenches before the Allied drive of September 26... - NARA - 530763.tif|thumb|right|alt=A view of a ruined town.|[[Avocourt]], 1918, one of the many destroyed French villages where reconstruction would be funded by reparations]]\n\nIn 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out. For the next four years fighting raged across [[European theatre of World War I|Europe]], the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]], and [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|Asia]].{{sfn|Simkins|Jukes|Hickey|2003|p=9}} On 8 January 1918, United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a statement that became known as the [[Fourteen Points]]. In part, this speech called for Germany to withdraw from the territory it had occupied and for the formation of a [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=429}}<ref>[[s:Fourteen Points Speech|Fourteen Points Speech]]</ref> During the fourth quarter of 1918, the [[Central Powers]] began to collapse.{{sfn|Beller|2007|pp=182\u201395}} In particular, the German military was decisively defeated on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and the German navy [[Kiel mutiny|mutinied]], prompting domestic uprisings that became known as the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|German Revolution]].{{sfn|Simkins|2002|p=71}}{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=638}}{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=101}}\n\nMost of the war's major battles occurred in France and the French countryside was [[Zone rouge|heavily scarred]] in the fighting. Furthermore, in 1918 during the German retreat, German troops devastated France's most industrialized region in the north-east ([[Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin]]). Extensive looting took place as German forces removed whatever material they could use and destroyed the rest. Hundreds of mines were destroyed along with railways, bridges, and entire villages. [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Georges Clemenceau]] was determined, for these reasons, that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage it had caused. Clemenceau viewed reparations as a way of weakening Germany to ensure it could never threaten France again.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|pp=41\u201343, 58}}{{sfn|MacMillan|2003|p=202}} His position was shared by the French electorate.{{sfn|Brezina|2006|p=20}} Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, including Belgium, which were also directly affected by the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=14}} Despite domestic pressure for a harsh settlement, British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] opposed overbearing reparations. He argued for a smaller sum, which would be less damaging to the German economy with a long term goal of ensuring Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner. He also argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances for war widows, which would reserve a larger share of the reparations for the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=44}}{{sfn|Brezina|2006|p=21}}{{sfn|Yearwood|2009|p=127}} Wilson opposed these positions and was adamant that no indemnity should be imposed upon Germany.{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=272}}\n\nThe [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] opened on 18 January 1919, aiming to establish a lasting peace between the Allied and Central Powers.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=37}} Demanding compensation from the defeated party was a common feature of peace treaties.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=22}} However, the financial terms of treaties signed during the peace conference were labelled reparations to distinguish them from [[Punitive damages|punitive settlements]] usually known as [[Indemnity|indemnities]]. Reparations were intended for reconstruction and compensating families who had been bereaved by the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=14}} The opening article of the reparation section of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]], served as a legal basis for the following articles, which obliged Germany to pay compensation{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=231}} and limited German responsibility to civilian damages. The same article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231\u201332}}\n\n==German reaction==\n{{Main|Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles}}\n[[File:Mass demonstration in front of the Reichstag against the Treaty of Versailles.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Demonstration against the Treaty of Versailles, in front of the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]].</center>|alt=Thousands of people gather in front of a building.]]\n\nIn February 1919, [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau|Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau]] informed the [[Weimar National Assembly]] that Germany would have to pay reparations for the devastation caused by the war, but would not pay for actual war costs.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=133\u201335}} After the drafting of the Treaty of Versailles on 7 May that year, the German and Allied delegations met and the treaty was handed over to be translated and for a response to be issued. At this meeting Brockdorff-Rantzau stated, \"We know the intensity of the hatred which meets us, and we have heard the victors' passionate demand that as the vanquished we shall be made to pay, and as the guilty we shall be punished\". However, he proceeded to deny that Germany was solely responsible for the war.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=135\u201336}}\n\nArticle 231 of the Treaty of Versailles was not correctly translated. Instead of stating \"...&nbsp;Germany accepts responsibility of Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage&nbsp;...\", the German Government's edition reads, \"Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as authors of the war, are responsible for all losses and damages&nbsp;...\".{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|pp=399\u2013400}} This resulted in a prevailing belief of humiliation among Germans; the article was seen as an injustice and there was a view that Germany had signed \"away her honor\".{{sfn|Morrow|2005|p=290}}{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|p=400}} Despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware \"that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=537\u201338}} Politicians seeking international sympathy would continue to use the article for its propaganda value, persuading many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231\u201332}} German revisionist historians who later tried to ignore the validity of the clause found a ready audience among revisionist writers in France, Britain, and the US.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=21}} The objective of both the politicians and historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1940|p=15}}\n\n==Evolution of reparations==\n\n===Initial demands===\n{{further|Treaty of Versailles|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R02190, Deutsche Reparationslieferungen.jpg|thumb|right|Trains loaded with machinery deliver their cargo in 1920 as reparation payment in kind.|alt=Several trains loaded with machinery take up the center of the photo. A group of nine men stand to the left.]]\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles stated that a Reparation Commission would be established in 1921. This commission would consider the resources available to Germany and her capacity to pay, provide the German Government with an opportunity to be heard on the subject, and decide on the final reparation figure that Germany would be required to pay. In the interim, Germany was required to pay an equivalent of {{nowrap|20 billion}} gold marks {{nowrap|({{USD|5 billion}})}} in gold, commodities, ships, securities, or other forms. The money would be used to pay Allied occupation costs and to buy food and raw materials for Germany.{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=156}}<ref>[[s: Treaty of Versailles/Part VIII|Treaty of Versailles, articles 232\u2013235]]</ref> Article 121 of the Treaty of Neuilly acknowledged that \"the resources of Bulgaria are not sufficient to enable her to make complete reparation\".

This would not be credited towards the reparation figure.<ref>[[s: Treaty of Neuilly/Part VII#Article 127|Treaty of Neuilly, Article 127]]</ref> Likewise, Bulgaria had to dispatch 50,000 tons of coal a year to the Serb-Croat-Slovene State in restitution for destroyed mines. These shipments would not be credited against Bulgaria's reparation sum.<ref>[[s: Treaty of Neuilly/Part VII#Article 128|Treaty of Neuilly, Article 128]]</ref> Germany, Austria, and Hungary all had commitments to handover timber, ore, and livestock to the Allied Powers. They would, however, be credited for these goods.<ref>[[s: Treaty of Versailles/Part VIII|Treaty of Versailles, Annex IV\u2013V]]</ref><ref>[[s: Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Annex IV\u2013V]]</ref><ref>[[s: Treaty of Trianon/Part VIII|Treaty of Trianon, Annex V]]</ref>\n\nIn January 1921, the Allied Powers grew impatient and established the reparation sum at 226&nbsp;billion gold marks. The Germans countered with an offer of 30&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=410}} On 24 April 1921, the German Government wrote to the American Government expressing \"her readiness to acknowledge for reparation purposes a total liability of 50&nbsp;billion gold marks\", but was also prepared \"to pay the equivalent of this sum in annuities adapted to her economic capacity totalling 200&nbsp;billion gold marks\".{{sfn|United States Department of State|1921|p=46}} In addition, the German Government stated that \"to accelerate the redemption of the balance\" and \"to combat misery and hatred created by the war\", Germany was willing to provide the resources needed and \"to undertake herself the rebuilding of townships, villages, and hamlets\".{{sfn|United States Department of State|1921|p=47}}\n\n===London Schedule of Payments===\nThe London Schedule of Payments of 5 May 1921 established \"the full liability of all the Central Powers combined, not just Germany alone,\" at {{nowrap|132 billion}} gold marks.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} This sum was a compromise promoted by Belgium{{mdash}}against higher figures demanded by the French and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] and the lower figure the British supported{{mdash}}that \"represented an assessment of the lowest amount that public opinion&nbsp;...&nbsp;would tolerate\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=236}}\n\nThis figure was divided into three series of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]: \"A\" and \"B\" Bonds together had a nominal value of {{nowrap|50 billion}} gold marks {{nowrap|({{US$|12.5&nbsp;billion)}}}}{{mdash}}less than the sum Germany had previously offered to pay. \"C\" Bonds, comprising the remainder of the reparation figure, \"were deliberately designed to be [[Chimera (mythology)|chimerical]].\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} They were \"a political bargaining chip\" that served the domestic policies of France and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Crafts|Fearon|2013|p=113}} The figure was completely unreal; its primary function was to mislead public opinion \"into believing that the 132-billion-mark figure was being maintained\". Furthermore, \"Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay 132&nbsp;billion marks and that the other Central Powers could pay little. Thus, the A and B Bonds, which were genuine, represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay.\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} Taking into account the sum already paid between 1919 and 1921, Germany's immediate obligation was 41&nbsp;billion gold marks.{{sfn|Ferguson|1998|p=414}}\n\nTo pay towards this sum, Germany could pay in kind or in cash. Commodities paid in kind included coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. The gold value of these would be deducted from what Germany was required to pay. Germany's assistance with the restoration of the university library of [[Leuven|Louvain]], which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum, as were some of the territorial changes the treaty imposed upon Germany.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=223\u201334}}{{sfn|Kramer|2008|p=10}} The payment schedule required {{nowrap|{{US$|250 million}}}} within twenty-five days and then {{nowrap|{{US$|500 million}}}} annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports. The German Government was to issue bonds at five per cent interest and set up a [[sinking fund]] of one per cent to support the payment of reparations.{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=156}}\n\n===End of reparations for Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Turkey===\n\nBetween the signing of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine and April 1922, Bulgaria paid 173 million gold francs in reparations.{{sfn|World Peace Foundation|1922|p=18}} In 1923, the Bulgarian reparation sum was revised downwards to 550 million gold francs, \"plus a lump sum payment of 25&nbsp;million francs for occupation costs\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=234\u201335}} Towards this figure, Bulgaria paid 41 million gold francs between 1925 and 1929. In 1932, the Bulgarian reparation obligation was abandoned following the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]].{{sfn|Crampton|1987|p=84}}\n\nBecause Austria was \"so impoverished\" after the war, and because of the collapse of the Bank of Vienna, the country paid no reparations \"beyond credits for transferred property\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=234\u201335}}{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=59}} Likewise, Hungary paid no reparations beyond coal deliveries because of the collapse of the Hungarian economy.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=234\u201335}}{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=60}} Turkish reparations had been \"sharply limited in view of the magnitude of Turkish territorial losses\". However, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was never ratified. When the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed in 1923, Turkish reparations were \"eliminated altogether\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=234\u201335}}\n\n===German defaults===\n{{Main|Occupation of the Ruhr}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00121, M\u00fcnchen, Turnfest, Festzug.jpg|thumb|right|Protests by gymnasts from the Ruhr at the 1923 [[Munich]] Gymnastics Festival.

In an attempt to rectify this situation, the [[Spa Conference of 1920|Spa Conference]] was held in July 1920. At this conference it was decided that Germany would be paid five marks per coal ton delivered to facilitate coal shipments and help feed the miners. Despite this, Germany continued to default on her obligations.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=235\u201336}} By late 1922, the German defaults on payments had grown so serious and regular that a crisis engulfed the Reparations Commission. French and Belgian delegates urged the seizure of the [[Ruhr]] to encourage the Germans to make more effort to pay, while the British supported postponing payments to facilitate the financial reconstruction of Germany.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=239\u201340}} On 26 December 1922, Germany defaulted on timber deliveries. The timber quota was based upon a German proposal and the default was massive.{{refn|name=timberdefault|group=Note|By the 1922 quota deadline, \"France had received 29% of her sawn timber allotment and 29% of her share of telegraph poles.\" While the German default was aimed specifically at France, there \"was also substantial default on timber deliveries to Belgium and Italy\". In addition, Britain \"was still awaiting 99.80\" per cent of her 1922 timber deliveries.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=240}}}} The Allies were unanimous that the default was in bad faith.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=240}} In January 1923, despite quota reductions, the German Government defaulted on coal deliveries for the 34th time in three years following the loss of the [[Upper Silesia]]n coal fields containing 11 per cent of German coal resources, which had been transferred to Poland.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=241}}{{sfn|Hehn|2005|p=66}}\n\nOn 9 January 1923, the Reparation Commission declared Germany to be in default of her coal deliveries and voted to occupy the Ruhr to enforce the country's reparation commitments. Britain was the lone dissenting voice to both measures. On 11 January, French and Belgian soldiers{{mdash}}supported by engineers including an Italian contingent{{mdash}}entered the region, initiating the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]].{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=243}}{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe French Premier [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was deeply reluctant to order the occupation and had only taken this step after the British had rejected his proposals for more moderate sanctions against Germany.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=244}} By December 1922, Poincar\u00e9 was faced with Anglo-American-German hostility; coal supplies for French steel production were running low.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=26}} Exasperated with Britain's failure to act, he wrote to the French ambassador in London:\n<blockquote>Judging others by themselves, the English, who are blinded by their loyalty, have always thought that the Germans did not abide by their pledges inscribed in the Versailles Treaty because they had not frankly agreed to them&nbsp;...&nbsp;We, on the contrary, believe that if Germany, far from making the slightest effort to carry out the treaty of peace, has always tried to escape her obligations, it is because until now she has not been convinced of her defeat&nbsp;...&nbsp;We are also certain that Germany, as a nation, resigns herself to keep her pledged word only under the impact of necessity.{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1942|p= 140}}</blockquote>\n\nThe occupation proved marginally profitable; the occupying powers received 900 million gold marks, and much of this merely covered the military costs of occupation. However, the real issue behind the occupation was not German defaults on coal and timber deliveries, but the forcing of Germany \"to acknowledge her defeat in World War I and to accept the Versailles Treaty\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}} Poincar\u00e9 recognized that if Germany could get away with defying Versailles in regard to the reparations, a precedent would be created and inevitably the Germans would proceed to dismantle the rest of the Versailles treaty.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}}\n\n===Dawes Plan===\n{{Main|Dawes Plan}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00924, Berlin, Amerikanisches Gold f\u00fcr die Reichsbank.jpg|thumb|alt=men standing around looking at barrels|The first American gold arrives as per the Dawes Plan]]\n\nAlthough the French succeeded in their objective during the Ruhr occupation, the Germans had wrecked their economy by funding passive resistance and brought about [[hyperinflation]].{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}} Under Anglo-American pressure and simultaneous decline in the value of the franc, France was increasingly isolated and her diplomatic position was weakened.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=246}} In October 1923, a committee consisting of American, Belgian, British, French, German, and Italian experts and chaired by the former Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget|US Bureau of the Budget]] [[Charles G. Dawes]] was formed, to consider \"from a purely technical standpoint\", how to balance the German budget, stabilize the economy and set an achievable level of reparations.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nIn April 1924, the [[Dawes Plan]] was accepted and it replaced the London schedule of payment. While the \"C\" Bonds were omitted from the plan's framework, they were not formally rescinded. French troops were to withdraw from the Ruhr, and a bank independent of the German Government, with a ruling body at least {{nowrap|50 per cent non-German}}, was to be established and the German currency was to be stabilized. The payment of reparations was also reorganized. In the first year following the implementation of the plan, Germany would have to pay {{nowrap|1 billion}} marks. This figure would rise to {{nowrap|2.5 billion}} marks per year by the fifth year of the plan. A Reparations Agency was established with Allied representatives to organize the payment of reparations. Furthermore, a loan of {{nowrap|800 million}} marks was to be raised{{mdash}}over 50 per cent coming from the United States, 25 per cent from Britain, and the balance from other European nations{{mdash}}to back the German currency and to aid in the payment of reparations.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=37\u201338}}{{sfn|Crafts|Fearon|2013|pp=82, 114}}\n\n===Young Plan===\n{{Main|Young Plan}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08968, Er\u00f6ffnung der zweiten Haager Konferenz.jpg|thumb|alt=Great hall containing many people|The opening of the [[Hague conference on reparations|Second Hague Conference]]: one of the two conferences aimed at implementing the Young Plan.]]\n\nThe adoption of the plan was followed by the [[Locarno Treaties]]. The subsequent \"spirit of Locarno\" saw an apparent reconciliation between the European Powers. The implementation of the Dawes Plan also saw a positive economic impact in Europe, largely funded by American loans.{{sfn|Herring|Carroll|1996|p=70}} Under the Dawes Plan, Germany always met her obligations.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=249\u201350}} However, German long term goals reminded the same despite the apparent reconciliation: the revision of the Treaty of Versailles to end reparations. The Dawes Plan was seen only a temporary measure, with expected future revisions.{{sfn|Herring|Carroll|1996|p=70}}{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=249\u201350}} In late 1927, the Agent-General for Reparations \"called for a more permanent scheme\" for payments and in 1928 the Germans followed suit.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=249}} German Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] called for a final reparation plan to be established alongside an early withdrawal of Allied troops from the Rhineland. The French, aware of their weakening political and financial position, acquiesced. On 16 September 1928, a joint Entente-German statement acknowledging the need for a new reparation plan was issued.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=249\u201350}}\n\nIn February 1929, a new committee was formed to re-examine reparations. It was chaired by the American banker [[Owen D. Young]] and presented its findings in June 1929. The \"[[Young Plan]]\" was accepted and was ratified by the German Government on 12 March 1930. The plan established a theoretical final reparation figure at 112&nbsp;billion gold marks {{nowrap|({{USD|26.35 billion}})}}, with a new payment schedule that would see reparations completed by 1988{{mdash}}the first time a final date had been set. In addition, foreign oversight of German finances was to end with the withdrawal of the Reparations Agency, which would be replaced by the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. The bank was established to provide cooperation among central banks and to receive and disburse reparation payments. A further loan of {{Nowrap|{{USD|300 million}}}} was to be raised and given to Germany.{{sfn|Backhaus|2012|p=70}}{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=38}}{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=250\u201351}}{{sfn|Young|2006|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the plan, German payments were half the sum required under the Dawes Plan.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=251\u201352}} The implementation of the Young Plan required the Anglo-French withdrawal from the Rhineland within months.{{sfn|Shamir|1989|p=25}} Despite the reduction, there was increasing German hostility to the plan. For example, the Law against the Enslavement of the German People, or Freedom Law, was proposed by the nationalist politician [[Alfred Hugenberg]]. Hugenberg's proposed law called the of the Ruhr occupation, the official renouncement of the Article 231. and the rejection of the Young Plan. While politicians rejected it, it attracted enough support from voters in order to put up for a referendum. The [[German referendum, 1929|plebiscite]] was held in December 1929, resulting in 5.8 million people out of 6.3 million voters, voting in favor for the law. This fell below the required 21 million votes in order for it to take effect. While this was a political defeat for Hugenberg, it did result in significant national attention for [[Adolf Hitler]] and subsequently valuable right-wing financing.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=251}}{{sfn|Mommsen|Foster|1988|pp=279-281}}{{sfn|Nohlen|St\u00f6ver|2010|p=770}}\n\n===End of German reparations===\n{{Main|Lausanne Conference of 1932}}\n\nIn March 1930, the German Government collapsed and was replaced by a new coalition led by Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]]. In June, Allied troops withdrew from near [[Mainz]]{{mdash}}the last occupation zone in the Rhineland{{mdash}}and Br\u00fcning's Government broached the subject of demanding further refinement to reparations, but this demand was refused by [[William Tyrrell, 1st Baron Tyrrell|William Tyrrell]], the British ambassador to France.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=171\u201372}} During 1931, a financial crisis began in Germany. In May, [[Creditanstalt]]{{mdash}}the largest bank in Austria{{mdash}}collapsed, sparking a banking crisis in Germany and Austria. In response, Br\u00fcning announced that Germany was suspending reparation payments. This resulted in a massive withdrawal of domestic and foreign funds from German banks. By mid-July, all German banks had closed.{{sfn|Young|2006|p=174}} Until this point, France's policy had been to provide Germany with financial support to help Br\u00fcning's Government stabilize the country. Br\u00fcning, now under considerable political pressure from [[Far-right politics|the far-right]] and [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]], was unable to make any concessions or reverse policy. As a result, Br\u00fcning was unable to borrow money from foreign or domestic sources. Further attempts to enlist British support to end reparations failed; the British said it was a joint issue with France and the United States. In early July, Br\u00fcning announced \"his intention to seek the outright revision of the Young Plan\".{{sfn|Shamir|1989|pp=56\u201358}} In light of the crisis and with the prospect of Germany being unable to repay her debts, United States President [[Herbert Hoover]] intervened. In June, Hoover publicly proposed a one-year [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] to reparation and war debts. By July, the \"[[Hoover Moratorium]]\" had been accepted.{{sfn|Crafts|Fearon|2013|p=155}}\n\nThe moratorium was widely supported in both Germany and the United Kingdom. The French, initially hesitant, eventually agreed to support the American proposal.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1960|p=200}} However, on 13 July, the German [[Danatbank|Darmst\u00e4dter Bank]] collapsed, leading to further bankruptcies and a rise in unemployment further exacerbating Germany's financial crisis.{{sfn|Harsch|2009|p=160}} With the [[Great Depression]] now exerting its influence, the Bank for International Settlements reported that the Young Plan was unrealistic in light of the economic crisis and urged the world governments to reach a new settlement on the various debts they owed each other. During January 1932, Br\u00fcning said he would seek the complete cancellation of reparations. His position was supported by the British and Italians, and opposed by the French.{{sfn|Temin|Toniolo|2008|p=137}}\n\nBecause of the political differences between countries on the subject and impending elections in France and Germany, a conference could not be established until June. This delay brought about the downfall of Br\u00fcning's Government. On 16 June, the Lausanne Conference opened. However, discussions were complicated by the ongoing [[World Disarmament Conference]]. At the latter conference, the US informed the British and French that they would not be allowed to default on their war debts. In turn, they recommended that war debts be tied into German reparation payments, to which the Germans objected. On 9 July, an agreement was reached and signed. The Lausanne Conference annulled the Young Plan and required Germany to pay a final, single installment of 3&nbsp;billion marks, saving France from political humiliation and ending Germany's obligation to pay reparations.{{sfn|Temin|Toniolo|2008|pp=137\u201338}}{{sfn|Mommsen|Foster|1988|p=454}}{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=78}}\n\n===Amount paid by Germany===\nThe precise figure Germany paid is a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Grenville|Wasserstein|2000|p=140}} The German Government estimated it had paid the equivalent of 67.8&nbsp;billion gold marks in reparations. The German figure included{{mdash}}other than gold or goods in kind{{mdash}}the [[scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow]], state property lost in lands ceded to other countries, and the loss of colonial territories.{{sfn|Kindleberger|1986|p=19}} The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements state that {{nowrap|20.598 billion}} gold marks was paid by Germany in reparations, of which {{nowrap|7.595 billion}} was paid before the implementation of the London Schedule of Payments.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=233}} [[Niall Ferguson]] provides a slightly lower figure. He estimates that Germany paid no more than {{nowrap|19 billion}} gold marks.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} Ferguson further estimates that this sum amounted to 2.4 per cent of Germany's national income between 1919 and 1932. Stephen Schuker, in his definitive econometric study, concedes that Germany transferred 16.8&nbsp;billion marks over the whole period, but points out that this sum was vastly offset by the devaluation of Allied paper-mark deposits up to 1923, and by loans that Germany subsequently repudiated after 1924. The net capital transfer into Germany amounted to 17.75&nbsp;billion marks, or 2.1% of Germany's entire national income over the period 1919\u20131931. In effect, America paid Germany four times more, in price-adjusted terms, than the U.S. furnished to West Germany under the post-1948 Marshall Plan.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}}{{sfn|Schuker|1988|p=11, 106-19}}{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=43}} According to [[Gerhard Weinberg]], reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid. However, the burden of repairs was shifted away from the German economy and onto the damaged economies of the war's victors.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=16}} Hans Mommsen wrote \"Germany financed its reparation payments to Western creditor nations with American loans\", which the British and French then used to \"cover their long-term interest obligations and to retire their wartime debts with the United States.\"{{sfn|Mommsen|Foster|1988|p=177}}\n\n===Loan payments===\nTo help make reparations payments, Germany took out various loans during the 1920s. In 1933, following the cancellation of reparations, the new German Chancellor Adolf Hitler cancelled all payments. In June 1953, an [[London Agreement on German External Debts|agreement was reached on this existing debt]] with West Germany. Germany agreed to repay 50 per cent of the loan amounts that had been defaulted on in the 1920s, but deferred some of the debt until West and [[East Germany]] were [[German reunification|unified]]. In 1995, following reunification, Germany began making the final payments towards the loans. A final installment of {{Nowrap|{{USD|94 million}}}} was made on 3 October 2010, settling German loan debts in regard to reparations.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html|title=Why Did World War I Just End? |last1=Suddath|first1=Claire|date=4 October 2010|journal=Time|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Rather, loans were taken out, placing Germany in an economically precarious position as more money entered circulation, destroying the link between paper money and the gold reserve that had been maintained before the war. With its defeat, Germany could not impose reparations and pay off her war debts now, which were now colossal.{{sfn|Peukert|1993|p=62}}\n\nNiall Ferguson partially supports this analysis. He says that had reparations not been imposed, Germany would still have had significant problems caused by the need to pay war debts and the demands of voters for more social services.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=420\u201321}} Ferguson also says that these problems were aggravated by a trade deficit and a weak exchange rate for the mark during 1920. Afterwards, as the value of the mark rose, inflation became a problem. None of these, he says, were the result of reparations.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=413}} Ferguson says that even without reparations, total public spending in Germany between 1920 and 1923 was 33 per cent of total net national product.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=420\u201321}} [[A.J.P. Taylor]] says, \"Germany was a net gainer by the financial transactions of the nineteen-twenties: she borrowed far more from private American investors&nbsp;...&nbsp;than she paid in reparations\".{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=44}} P.M.H. Bell says the creation of a multi-national committee, which resulted in the Dawes Plan, was done to consider ways the German budget could be balanced, the currency stabilized, and the German economy fixed to ease reparation payments.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=37}} [[Max Winkler]] says that from 1924 onward, German officials were \"virtually flooded with loan offers by foreigners\". Overall, he says, the German economy performed reasonably well until the foreign investments funding the economy and the loans funding reparations payments were suddenly withdrawn after the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|1929 Stock Market Crash]]. This collapse was magnified by the volume of loans provided to German companies by US lenders. Even the reduced payments of the Dawes Plan were mainly financed through a large volume of international loans.{{sfn|Winkler|1933|pp=86\u201387}}\n\nWhile Germany initially had a trade deficit, British policy during the early 1920s was to reintegrate Germany into European trade as soon as possible. Likewise, France attempted to secure trade deals with Germany.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=24}} During the mid-to-late 1920s, trade between France and Germany grew rapidly. French imports of German goods \"increased by 60 per cent\", highlighting the close links between French industrial growth and German production, and the increase in cooperation between the countries.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nMax Hantke and Mark Spoerer provide a different perspective on the effect of reparations on the German economy. They say that focusing on the reparations and inflation ignores \"the fact that the restriction of the German military to 115,000 men relieved the German central budget considerably\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=849}} Hantke and Spoerer also say that their findings show \"that even under quite rigorous assumptions the net economic burden of the Treaty of Versailles was much less heavy than has been hitherto thought, in particular if we confine our perspective to the Reich's budget\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=851}} They say, \"though politically a humiliation\", the limitation on the military \"was beneficial in fiscal terms\" and that their economic models show that \"the restriction of the size of the army was clearly beneficial for the Reich budget\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=860}} Additionally, their economic scenarios indicate that while the Treaty of Versailles was \"overall clearly a burden on the German economy\", it \"also offered a substantial peace dividend for Weimar's non-revanchist budget politicians.\" They conclude that, \"The fact that [these politicians] did not make sufficient use of this imposed gift supports the hypothesis that the Weimar Republic suffered from home-made political failure\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=861}}\n\n====Hyperinflation====\n{{further|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\n[[File:Germany Hyperinflation.svg|thumb|alt=A chart with a black line depicting the rapid increase of hyperinflation.|A logarithmic scale depicting Weimar hyperinflation to 1923. One paper Mark per Gold Mark increased to one trillion paper Marks per Gold Mark.]]\n\nErik Goldstein wrote that in 1921, the payment of reparations caused a crisis and that the occupation of the Ruhr had a disastrous effect on the German economy, resulting in the German Government printing more money as the currency collapsed. Hyperinflation began and printing presses worked overtime to print Reichsbank notes; by November 1923 one US dollar was worth {{nowrap|4,200,000,000,000 marks.}}{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=156}} Ferguson writes that the policy of the Economics Minister [[Robert Schmidt (German politician)|Robert Schmidt]] led Germany to avoid economic collapse from 1919 to 1920, but that reparations accounted for most of Germany's deficit in 1921 and 1922 and that reparations were the cause of the hyperinflation.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=409\u201310, 425}}\n\nSeveral historians counter the argument that reparations caused the inflation and collapse of the mark. Gerhard Weinberg writes that Germany refused to pay by, and that doing so destroyed their own currency.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=16}} Anthony Lentin agrees and writes that inflation was \"a consequence of the war rather than of the peace\" and that hyperinflation was a result of the \"German government's reckless issue of paper money\" during the Allied occupation of the Ruhr.{{sfn|Lentin|2012|p=26}} British and French experts believed that the Mark was being sabotaged to avoid budgetary and currency reform and to evade reparations. Sally Marks writes that the Germans claimed that reparations destroyed the Mark. Marks writes that historians who say reparations caused hyperinflation have overlooked \"that the inflation long predated reparations\" and the way \"inflation mushroomed\" between mid-1921 and the end of 1922 \"when Germany was actually paying very little in reparations\" and have failed to explain why \"the period of least inflation coincided with the period of largest reparation payments&nbsp;...&nbsp;or why Germans claimed after 1930 that reparations were causing deflation\". She writes \"there is no doubt that British and French suspicions late in 1922 were sound\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=239}} Marks also writes that the \"astronomic inflation which ensued was a result of German policy\", whereby the government paid for passive resistance in the Ruhr \"from an empty exchequer\" and paid off its domestic and war debts with worthless marks.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}}{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=24}} Bell agrees and writes that \"inflation had little direct connection with reparation payments themselves, but a great deal to do with the way the German government chose to subsidize industry and to pay the costs of passive resistance to the occupation [of the Ruhr] by extravagant use of the printing press\". Bell also writes that hyperinflation was not an inevitable consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, but was among the actual results.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=25}}\n\n===Reparations===\n\n====Contemporaneous====\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|<center>John Maynard Keynes in 1933</center>|alt=A seated man looks on the side.]]\n\nAccording to historian Claude Campbell, [[John Maynard Keynes]] \"set the fashion for critics of the economic aspects of the treaty\" and \"made probably the severest and most sweeping indictment of its economic provisions\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=161}} Keynes was temporarily attached to the [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] during the war and was their official representative at the peace conference. He later resigned \"when it became evident that hope could no longer be entertained of substantial modifications in the draft Terms of Peace\" due to the \"policy of the Conference towards the economic problems of Europe\". In 1919, he wrote ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'' based on his objections.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|loc=preface}} He wrote that he believed \"that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible\",{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=146}} and called the treaty a \"[[Carthaginian peace]]\" that would economically affect all of Europe.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|pp=86\u201387}} Keynes said that the treaty's reparation figures \"generally exceed Germany's capacity\" to pay.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=215}} He said that {{USD|10 billion}} was the \"safe maximum figure\", but even then he did \"not believe that [Germany could] pay as much\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=200}} He said the Reparation Commission was a tool that could \"be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic organization as well as to exact payment\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=79}}\n\nIn Keynes' opinion, the reparation figure should have been fixed \"well within Germany's capacity to pay\" so to \"make possible the renewal of hope and enterprise within her territory\" and to \"avoid the perpetual friction and opportunity of improper pressure arising out of the Treaty clauses\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=265}} Keynes identified reparations as the \"main excursion into the economic field\" by the Treaty of Versailles, but said that the treaty excluded provisions for rehabilitating Europe's economies, for improving relations between the Allies and the defeated Central Powers, for stabilizing Europe's new nations, for \"reclaim[ing] Russia\", or for promoting economic solidarity between the Allies.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=226}} Coal provides an example of these destabilizing effects in Germany and beyond. Keynes said the \"surrender of the coal will destroy German industry\" but conceding that without coal shipments as reparations, the French and Italian industries damaged directly by the war or indirectly by damage to coal mines would be affected. He writes that this is \"not yet the whole problem\". The repercussions would also affect Central and Northern Europe, and neutral states such as Switzerland and Sweden, which made up for their own coal deficiencies by trading with Germany. Likewise, Keynes said Austria would now be consigned to \"industrial ruin\" as \"nearly all the coalfields of the former Empire lie outside of what is now [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]]\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nCampbell writes that the \"apparent majority did not regard the treaty as perfect\". [[Bernard Baruch]] writes in ''[[The Making of the Reparation and Economic Sections of the Treaty]]'' that most believed it to be the best agreement obtainable under the circumstances and that it was a minority that attacked the treaty, but these attacks \"centered upon its economic provisions\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=160}} [[James T. Shotwell]], writing in ''What Germany Forgot'', said, \"the only 'unendurable servitudes' in the treaty were in the sections on Reparation and the Polish settlement and raised the question as to what part of Germany's grievance against the peace lay in the substance of its exactions and what part in the manner of their imposition\". Sir Andrew McFayden, who also represented the British Treasury at the peace conference and later worked with the Reparation Commission, published his work ''Don't Do it Again''. McFayden's position \"falls somewhere between the views of Keynes and Shotwell\". His attack on reparations \"was as harsh as Keynes\" but he conceded that the \"fault did not lie primarily in the provisions of the treaty but in their execution\". He also believed \"that he Polish settlement was the only readjustment&nbsp;...&nbsp;which was decidedly unwise\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|pp=161\u201362}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9]] writes that before the German surrender, Woodrow Wilson dispatched a note to the German Government on 5 November 1918 stating that the Allies \"under-stand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and their property by the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air\", the terms of which they accepted.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1940|p=15}} Regardless of which, Albrecht-Carri\u00e9 says the reparation section of the treaty proved \"to be a dismal failure\".{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1940|p=16}} Campbell says, \"although there was much in the peace that was 'petty, unjust, and humiliating', there was little aside from reparation clauses and certain territorial concessions, which had much real bearing upon Germany's economic future\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=162}} Summarizing the view of economists throughout the 1920s, she says the territorial changes to Germany were \"not necessarily&nbsp;...&nbsp;economically unsound\", but than the removal of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and territory to Poland \"depriv[ed] Germany of her resources in excess of the amount necessary to fulfill the legitimate economic demands of the victors&nbsp;...&nbsp;[and] was indefensible\". Campbell also said the treaty failed to include \"provisions looking to the restoration of Germany to her former position as the chief economic and financial stabilizing influence in central Europe\" and that this was economically shortsighted and was an economic failing of the treaty.{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=163}}\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Mantoux]], a French economist, was the harshest contemporaneous critic of Keynes. In his posthumously published book, ''The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes'', Mantoux said that Keynes \"had been wrong on various counts, especially with respect to his predictions about Germany's coal, iron and steel production&nbsp;...&nbsp;and its level of national saving\".{{sfn|Cord|2013|p=41}} Keynes said Europe's overall output of iron would decrease; Mantoux said the opposite occurred. By 1929, European iron output had increased by ten per cent from that of 1913. Keynes believed that this European trend would also affect German iron and steel production. Mantoux says this prediction was also incorrect. By 1927, German steel output had increased by 30 per cent and iron output increased by 38 per cent from 1913. Keynes predicted that German coal extraction would also decrease and that Germany would not be able to export coal immediately after the war. Mantoux also counters these arguments. By 1920, German was exporting 15 million tons of coal a year and reached 35&nbsp;million tons by 1926. By 1929, German coal mining had risen by 30 per cent on the 1913 figures because of her increased labor efficiency methods. In regard to national savings, Keynes stated that 2&nbsp;billion marks would only be possible after the adoption of the treaty. Mantoux says that the 1925 German national savings figure was estimated at 6.4&nbsp;billion marks, rising to 7.6&nbsp;billion marks by 1927.{{sfn|Mantoux|1952|pp=162\u201363}} Mantoux calculated that Germany borrowed between 8&nbsp;billion and 35&nbsp;billion marks in the period 1920\u20131931, while only paying 21&nbsp;billion in reparations. This, he says, allowed Germany to re-equip, expand, and modernize her industry.{{sfn|Henig|1995|p=62}} Highlighting the rearmament under Hitler, Mantoux said Germany \"had been in a stronger position to pay reparations than Keynes had made out\".{{sfn|Cord|2013|p=41}} He also says that Germany could have paid all of the reparations if she had wanted to, and that the problem was not that Germany was unable to pay, but that she was unwilling to pay.{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=70}}\n\nIn 1954, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]]{{mdash}}one of the authors of Article 231{{mdash}}said that, \"Efforts to bankrupt and humiliate a nation merely incite a people of vigor and of courage to break the bonds imposed upon them&nbsp;...&nbsp;Prohibitions thus incite the very acts that are prohibited.\"{{sfn|Immerman|1998|p=10}}\n\n====Modern====\n\n[[Geoff Harcourt]] writes that Keynes' arguments that reparations would lead to German economic collapse have been adopted \"by historians of almost all political persuasions\" and have influenced the way historians and the public \"see the unfolding events in Germany and the decades between Versailles and the outbreak of the Second World War\". He says Mantoux's work \"is not simply a critique of Keynes\", but \"a stimulus to question the received wisdom's interpretation of the unfolding events in Germany\". Harcourt says that despite it discussing Keynes' errors \"in great detail\", Mantoux's work \"has not led us to revise our general judgment of Keynes\", yet \"it does make us question the soundness of theoretical and empirical aspects\" of his arguments.{{sfn|Harcourt|2012|p=21}} A.J.P. Taylor writes that in 1919 \"many people believed that the payment of reparations would reduce Germany to a state of Asiatic poverty\", and that Keynes \"held this view, as did all Germans; and probably many Frenchmen\". However, he also says these \"apprehensions of Keynes and the Germans were grotesquely exaggerated\".{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=44}}\n\nAccording to Martel, Taylor \"shrewdly concludes that \u00c9tienne Mantoux had the better of his controversy with John Maynard Keynes\".{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=42}} Stephen Schuker writes that Keynes' \"tendentious but influential\" book was \"ably refuted\" by Mantoux.{{sfn|Schuker|1988|p=7}} [[Richard J. Evans]] says \"the economic history of the 1920s and early 1930s seemed to confirm\" the arguments of Keynes, yet \"as we now know\" Keynes' reparation arguments were wrong. Evans says the economic problems that arose were a result of the inflation of 1923, which lay with the German government rather than reparations.{{sfn|Evans|2008|loc=Hitler and the Origins of the War}}\n\nAccording to Slavieck, the \"traditional interpretation of the treaty's impact on Germany\" was that it \"plunged the nation into an economic free fall\".{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=95}} This view was shared by the German people, who believed the treaty was robbing Germany of its wealth. German banker [[Max Warburg]] said the terms of the treaty were \"pillage on a global scale\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=401}} Niall Ferguson says the German view was incorrect and \"not many historians would today agree with Warburg\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} However, several historians agree with Warburg.  [[Norman Davies]] writes that the treaty forced Germany to \"pay astronomic reparations\",{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=133}} while Tim McNeese states, \"France and Britain had placed war damages on Germany to the tune of billions of gold marks, which the defeated Germans could not begin to pay in earnest\".{{sfn|McNeese|2010|p=19}} Ferguson says the reparations were \"less of a burden than Keynes and others claimed\" and that the \"potential burden on national income of the annuity vary from 5 percent to 10 percent\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} However, he cautions against underestimating the initial German effort to pay. Before the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany transferred between eight and 13&nbsp;billion gold marks, which amounted to \"between 4 and 7 percent of total national income\". Ferguson says \"the annuity demanded in 1921 put an intolerable strain on the state's finances\" and that total expenditure between 1920 and 1923 amounted to \"at least 50 percent of Reich revenue, 20 percent of total Reich spending and 10 percent of total public spending\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=425}} Thus, Ferguson says, reparations \"undermined confidence in the Reich's creditworthiness\" and \"''were'' therefore excessive{{mdash}}as the German government claimed\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=426}}\n\nHantke and Spoerer write that \"reparation payments were indeed a severe economic burden for Germany\" and that \"the German economy was deprived of between one and 2.2&nbsp;billion Reichsmark (RM) annually, which amounted in the late 1920s to nearly 2.5 per cent of Germany's GDP\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=849}} [[Gerald Feldman]] writes, \"there can be no question that the entire London schedule could be viewed as a way of reducing the reparations bill without the Allied publics being fully informed of what was going on. This was recognized by at least some German politicians, one of whom optimistically argued that 'the entente will only demand the 50&nbsp;billion marks, not the rest. They have only called for the rest for domestic political reasons.'\"{{sfn|Feldman|1997|p=339}} Feldman also says the prospect that the 'C' bonds would be evoked hung over the German Government like a \"[[Damocles|Damocles Sword]]\".{{sfn|Feldman|1997|p=430}} In addition to Feldman and Ferguson's opposition, Peter Kruger, Barry Eichengreen, and Steven Webb agree that \"the initial German effort to pay reparations\" was substantial and \"produced an immense strain\" on the German economy.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=445-6}}\n\nSeveral historians take the middle ground between condemning reparations and supporting the argument that they were not a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, \"Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy\" as had been feared, however the \"psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system\".{{sfn|Peukert|1993|p=197}} P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a \"strain on the German balance of payments\", they could be paid and were \"compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry\".{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=38}} According to Martel, [[Robert Boyce]] said reparations were \"a heavy burden on Germany, both as a financial charge&nbsp;...&nbsp;and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments\". However, he says that while \"Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations\" this was far from the truth, and that \"&nbsp;...&nbsp;Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad\".{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=183}} William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, \"an increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=502}} However, [[Charles Feinstein]] writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans \"to accept even a modest increase in taxation to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries\". Feinstein says that \"even if the economic aspects&nbsp;...&nbsp;were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany\".{{sfn|Feinstein|1995|p=32}}\n\nSally Marks writes, \"There are those&nbsp;...&nbsp;who claim reparations were unpayable. In financial terms, that is untrue&nbsp;...&nbsp;Of course Germans did not want to pay; nobody ever wants to pay, and Weimar was determined not to do so&nbsp;...&nbsp;Raising taxes would have provided ample funds&nbsp;...&nbsp;Weimar could have borrowed from the citizenry, as France did after 1871 [to pay its indemnity to Germany]\".{{sfn|Marks|2013|pp=632\u201359}} Marks writes that Germany could have easily paid the 50&nbsp;billion marks in reparations, but instead chose to repeatedly default on payments as part of a political strategy of undermining Versailles.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=255}} Marks says that in 1921, Germany met her requirements in full because custom posts were occupied by Allied troops.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} Once the Allies had relinquished control of the customs posts, Germany made no further payments in cash until 1924 following the implementation of the Dawes Plan.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=238}} Marks says that while Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles \"established an unlimited theoretical liability\", Article 232 limited German responsibility to pay only for civilian damages. When the 1921 London conference to determine how much Germany should pay was called, the Allies calculated on the basis of what Germany could pay, not on their own needs.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=232}} In this way, Marks says, the Germans largely escaped paying for the war and instead shifted the costs onto American investors.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=254}} Marks states that the delay in establishing a final total until 1921, \"was actually in Germany's interest\" because the figures discussed at the peace conference were \"astronomic\". She says, \"The British experts, Lords [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Sumner]] and [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Cunliffe]], were so unrealistic that they were nicknamed [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|'the heavenly twins']].\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=233}} Marks also says, \"much ink has been wasted on the fact that civilian damages were stretched to cover war widows' pensions and allowances for military dependents\". As reparations were based on what Germany could pay, Marks says the inclusion of such items did not affect German liability but altered distribution of reparations; the \"inclusion of pensions and allowances increased the British share of the pie but did not enlarge the pie.\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=232}}\n\nBernadotte Schmitt writes that if \"pensions and separation allowances&nbsp;...&nbsp;not been included, reparations would probably never have become the bogey that poisoned the post-war world for so many years.{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=107}} Taylor says, \"no doubt the impoverishment of Germany was caused by war, not by reparations. Not doubt the Germans could have paid reparations, if they had regarded them as an obligation of honour, honestly incurred.\" However, he says, \"reparations&nbsp; ...&nbsp;kept the passions of war alive\".{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=44}} Peter Liberman writes that while the Germans believed they could not meet such demands of them, the \"French believed that Germany could pay and only lacked the requisite will\" to do so. Liberman says this is \"a position that has gained support from recent historical research\". In regard to Germany's capacity to pay, he focuses on coal and says that German coal consumption per capita was higher than France's despite coal shipments being consistently short. He also says, \"the reparations demanded at Versailles were not far out of proportion to German economic potential\" and that in terms of national income it was similar to what the Germans demanded of France following the [[Franco-Prussian War]].{{sfn|Liberman|1995|p=89}} [[Martin Kitchen]] also says the impression that Germany was crippled by the reparations is a myth. Rather than a weakened Germany, he states the opposite was true.{{sfn|Kitchen|2006|p=67}}\n\nKeylor says that literature on reparations has \"long suffered from gross misrepresentation, exaggeration, and outright falsification\" and that it \"should finally succumb to the archive-based discoveries of scholars\".{{sfn|Keylor|2013|loc=The Demonization of Versailles}} [[Diane Kunz]], summarizing the historiography on the subject, writes that historians have refuted the myth that reparations placed an intolerable burden on Germany.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=524}} Marks says a \"substantial degree of scholarly consensus now suggests that paying&nbsp;...&nbsp;was within Germany's financial capacity\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=357}} Ruth Henig writes, \"most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out\".{{sfn|Henig|1995|p=65}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n*[[Aftermath of World War I]]\n*[[Legal remedy]]\n*[[Restitution]]\n*[[Reparation (legal)]]\n*[[Reparations (transitional justice)|Reparations]]\n*[[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany]], [[Holocaust reparations]]\n*[[War reparations]]\n*[[World War II reparations]]\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}} \n* {{Cite journal|ref=harv|last=Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|first=Ren\u00e9|author1-link=|date=March 1940|title=Versailles Twenty Years After|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume= 55|issue= 1|pages=1\u201324|accessdate=|jstor=2143772|doi=10.2307/2143772|issn=}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|first1=Ren\u00e9|last1=Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|title=France, Europe and the Two World Wars|publisher=E.

Each of the defeated powers were required to make payments in either cash or kind. Because of the financial situation [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungary]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] found themselves in after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw its reparation figure reduced and then cancelled. Historians have recognized the [[Weimar Republic|German]] requirement to pay reparations as the \"chief battleground of the post-war era\" and \"the focus of the power struggle between [[French Third Republic|France]] and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised\".{{sfn|Henig|1995|p=63}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] (signed in 1919) and the 1921 London Schedule of Payments required Germany to pay 132&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark|gold marks]] {{nowrap|({{USD|33 billion}})}} in reparations to cover civilian damage caused during the war. This figure was divided into three categories of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]: A, B, and C. Of these, Germany was required to pay towards 'A' and 'B' bonds totaling 50&nbsp;billion marks ({{USD|12.5 billion}}) unconditionally. The payment of the remaining 'C' bonds was interest free and contingent on the Weimar Republic's ability to pay, as was to be assessed by an Allied committee.\n\nDue to the lack of reparation payments by Germany, France [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] in 1923 to enforce payments, causing an international crisis that resulted in the implementation of the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924. This plan outlined a new payment method and raised international loans to help Germany to meet its reparation commitments. Despite this, by 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the [[Young Plan]] that established the German reparation requirements at 112&nbsp;billion marks ({{USD|26.3 billion}}) and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were [[Hoover Moratorium|suspended for a year]] and in 1932 during the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne Conference]] they were cancelled altogether. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21&nbsp;billion marks in reparations.\n\nThe German people saw reparations as a national humiliation; the German Government worked to undermine the validity of the Treaty of Versailles and the requirement to pay. British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] called the treaty a [[Carthaginian peace]] that would economically destroy Germany. His arguments had a profound effect on historians, politicians, and the public at large. Despite Keynes' arguments and those by later historians supporting or reinforcing Keynes' views, the consensus of contemporary historians is that reparations were not as intolerable as the Germans or Keynes had suggested and were within Germany's capacity to pay had there been the political will to do so. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[West Germany]] took up payments. The 1953 [[London Agreement on German External Debts]] resulted in an agreement to pay 50 per cent of the remaining balance. The final payment was made on 3 October 2010, settling German loan debts in regard to reparations.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:A view of the ruins of Avocourt, situated just behind the American trenches before the Allied drive of September 26... - NARA - 530763.tif|thumb|right|alt=A view of a ruined town.|[[Avocourt]], 1918, one of the many destroyed French villages where reconstruction would be funded by reparations]]\n\nIn 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out. For the next four years fighting raged across [[European theatre of World War I|Europe]], the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]], and [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|Asia]].{{sfn|Simkins|Jukes|Hickey|2003|p=9}} On 8 January 1918, United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued a statement that became known as the [[Fourteen Points]]. In part, this speech called for Germany to withdraw from the territory it had occupied and for the formation of a [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=429}}<ref>[[s:Fourteen Points Speech|Fourteen Points Speech]]</ref> During the fourth quarter of 1918, the [[Central Powers]] began to collapse.{{sfn|Beller|2007|pp=182\u201395}} In particular, the German military was decisively defeated on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and the German navy [[Kiel mutiny|mutinied]], prompting domestic uprisings that became known as the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|German Revolution]].{{sfn|Simkins|2002|p=71}}{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=638}}{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=101}}\n\nMost of the war's major battles occurred in France and the French countryside was [[Zone rouge|heavily scarred]] in the fighting. Furthermore, in 1918 during the German retreat, German troops devastated France's most industrialized region in the north-east ([[Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin]]). Extensive looting took place as German forces removed whatever material they could use and destroyed the rest. Hundreds of mines were destroyed along with railways, bridges, and entire villages. [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Georges Clemenceau]] was determined, for these reasons, that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage it had caused. Clemenceau viewed reparations as a way of weakening Germany to ensure it could never threaten France again.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|pp=41\u201343, 58}}{{sfn|MacMillan|2003|p=202}} His position was shared by the French electorate.{{sfn|Brezina|2006|p=20}} Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, including Belgium, which were also directly affected by the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=14}} Despite domestic pressure for a harsh settlement, British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] opposed overbearing reparations. He argued for a smaller sum, which would be less damaging to the German economy with a long term goal of ensuring Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner. He also argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances for war widows, which would reserve a larger share of the reparations for the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=44}}{{sfn|Brezina|2006|p=21}}{{sfn|Yearwood|2009|p=127}} Wilson opposed these positions and was adamant that no indemnity should be imposed upon Germany.{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=272}}\n\nThe [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] opened on 18 January 1919, aiming to establish a lasting peace between the Allied and Central Powers.{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=37}} Demanding compensation from the defeated party was a common feature of peace treaties.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=22}} However, the financial terms of treaties signed during the peace conference were labelled reparations to distinguish them from [[Punitive damages|punitive settlements]] usually known as [[Indemnity|indemnities]]. Reparations were intended for reconstruction and compensating families who had been bereaved by the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=14}} The opening article of the reparation section of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]], served as a legal basis for the following articles, which obliged Germany to pay compensation{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=231}} and limited German responsibility to civilian damages. The same article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231\u201332}}\n\n==German reaction==\n{{Main|Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles}}\n[[File:Mass demonstration in front of the Reichstag against the Treaty of Versailles.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Demonstration against the Treaty of Versailles, in front of the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]].</center>|alt=Thousands of people gather in front of a building.]]\n\nIn February 1919, [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau|Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau]] informed the [[Weimar National Assembly]] that Germany would have to pay reparations for the devastation caused by the war, but would not pay for actual war costs.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=133\u201335}} After the drafting of the Treaty of Versailles on 7 May that year, the German and Allied delegations met and the treaty was handed over to be translated and for a response to be issued. At this meeting Brockdorff-Rantzau stated, \"We know the intensity of the hatred which meets us, and we have heard the victors' passionate demand that as the vanquished we shall be made to pay, and as the guilty we shall be punished\". However, he proceeded to deny that Germany was solely responsible for the war.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=135\u201336}}\n\nArticle 231 of the Treaty of Versailles was not correctly translated. Instead of stating \"...&nbsp;Germany accepts responsibility of Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage&nbsp;...\", the German Government's edition reads, \"Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as authors of the war, are responsible for all losses and damages&nbsp;...\".{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|pp=399\u2013400}} This resulted in a prevailing belief of humiliation among Germans; the article was seen as an injustice and there was a view that Germany had signed \"away her honor\".{{sfn|Morrow|2005|p=290}}{{sfn|Binkley|Mahr|1926|p=400}} Despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware \"that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=537\u201338}} Politicians seeking international sympathy would continue to use the article for its propaganda value, persuading many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=231\u201332}} German revisionist historians who later tried to ignore the validity of the clause found a ready audience among revisionist writers in France, Britain, and the US.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=21}} The objective of both the politicians and historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1940|p=15}}\n\n==Evolution of reparations==\n\n===Initial demands===\n{{further|Treaty of Versailles|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R02190, Deutsche Reparationslieferungen.jpg|thumb|right|Trains loaded with machinery deliver their cargo in 1920 as reparation payment in kind.|alt=Several trains loaded with machinery take up the center of the photo.

This commission would consider the resources available to Germany and her capacity to pay, provide the German Government with an opportunity to be heard on the subject, and decide on the final reparation figure that Germany would be required to pay. In the interim, Germany was required to pay an equivalent of {{nowrap|20 billion}} gold marks {{nowrap|({{USD|5 billion}})}} in gold, commodities, ships, securities, or other forms.

Furthermore, \"Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay 132&nbsp;billion marks and that the other Central Powers could pay little. Thus, the A and B Bonds, which were genuine, represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay.\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} Taking into account the sum already paid between 1919 and 1921, Germany's immediate obligation was 41&nbsp;billion gold marks.{{sfn|Ferguson|1998|p=414}}\n\nTo pay towards this sum, Germany could pay in kind or in cash. Commodities paid in kind included coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. The gold value of these would be deducted from what Germany was required to pay. Germany's assistance with the restoration of the university library of [[Leuven|Louvain]], which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum, as were some of the territorial changes the treaty imposed upon Germany.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=223\u201334}}{{sfn|Kramer|2008|p=10}} The payment schedule required {{nowrap|{{US$|250 million}}}} within twenty-five days and then {{nowrap|{{US$|500 million}}}} annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports.

Lining the road are crowds of supporting people.]]\n\nFrom the initiation of reparations, German coal deliveries were below the level agreed. In an attempt to rectify this situation, the [[Spa Conference of 1920|Spa Conference]] was held in July 1920. At this conference it was decided that Germany would be paid five marks per coal ton delivered to facilitate coal shipments and help feed the miners. Despite this, Germany continued to default on her obligations.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=235\u201336}} By late 1922, the German defaults on payments had grown so serious and regular that a crisis engulfed the Reparations Commission. French and Belgian delegates urged the seizure of the [[Ruhr]] to encourage the Germans to make more effort to pay, while the British supported postponing payments to facilitate the financial reconstruction of Germany.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=239\u201340}} On 26 December 1922, Germany defaulted on timber deliveries. The timber quota was based upon a German proposal and the default was massive.{{refn|name=timberdefault|group=Note|By the 1922 quota deadline, \"France had received 29% of her sawn timber allotment and 29% of her share of telegraph poles.\" While the German default was aimed specifically at France, there \"was also substantial default on timber deliveries to Belgium and Italy\". In addition, Britain \"was still awaiting 99.80\" per cent of her 1922 timber deliveries.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=240}}}} The Allies were unanimous that the default was in bad faith.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=240}} In January 1923, despite quota reductions, the German Government defaulted on coal deliveries for the 34th time in three years following the loss of the [[Upper Silesia]]n coal fields containing 11 per cent of German coal resources, which had been transferred to Poland.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=241}}{{sfn|Hehn|2005|p=66}}\n\nOn 9 January 1923, the Reparation Commission declared Germany to be in default of her coal deliveries and voted to occupy the Ruhr to enforce the country's reparation commitments. Britain was the lone dissenting voice to both measures. On 11 January, French and Belgian soldiers{{mdash}}supported by engineers including an Italian contingent{{mdash}}entered the region, initiating the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]].{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=243}}{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe French Premier [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] was deeply reluctant to order the occupation and had only taken this step after the British had rejected his proposals for more moderate sanctions against Germany.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=244}} By December 1922, Poincar\u00e9 was faced with Anglo-American-German hostility; coal supplies for French steel production were running low.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=26}} Exasperated with Britain's failure to act, he wrote to the French ambassador in London:\n<blockquote>Judging others by themselves, the English, who are blinded by their loyalty, have always thought that the Germans did not abide by their pledges inscribed in the Versailles Treaty because they had not frankly agreed to them&nbsp;...&nbsp;We, on the contrary, believe that if Germany, far from making the slightest effort to carry out the treaty of peace, has always tried to escape her obligations, it is because until now she has not been convinced of her defeat&nbsp;...&nbsp;We are also certain that Germany, as a nation, resigns herself to keep her pledged word only under the impact of necessity.{{sfn|Schwarzschild|1942|p= 140}}</blockquote>\n\nThe occupation proved marginally profitable; the occupying powers received 900 million gold marks, and much of this merely covered the military costs of occupation. However, the real issue behind the occupation was not German defaults on coal and timber deliveries, but the forcing of Germany \"to acknowledge her defeat in World War I and to accept the Versailles Treaty\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}} Poincar\u00e9 recognized that if Germany could get away with defying Versailles in regard to the reparations, a precedent would be created and inevitably the Germans would proceed to dismantle the rest of the Versailles treaty.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}}\n\n===Dawes Plan===\n{{Main|Dawes Plan}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00924, Berlin, Amerikanisches Gold f\u00fcr die Reichsbank.jpg|thumb|alt=men standing around looking at barrels|The first American gold arrives as per the Dawes Plan]]\n\nAlthough the French succeeded in their objective during the Ruhr occupation, the Germans had wrecked their economy by funding passive resistance and brought about [[hyperinflation]].{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}} Under Anglo-American pressure and simultaneous decline in the value of the franc, France was increasingly isolated and her diplomatic position was weakened.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=246}} In October 1923, a committee consisting of American, Belgian, British, French, German, and Italian experts and chaired by the former Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget|US Bureau of the Budget]] [[Charles G. Dawes]] was formed, to consider \"from a purely technical standpoint\", how to balance the German budget, stabilize the economy and set an achievable level of reparations.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nIn April 1924, the [[Dawes Plan]] was accepted and it replaced the London schedule of payment. While the \"C\" Bonds were omitted from the plan's framework, they were not formally rescinded. French troops were to withdraw from the Ruhr, and a bank independent of the German Government, with a ruling body at least {{nowrap|50 per cent non-German}}, was to be established and the German currency was to be stabilized. The payment of reparations was also reorganized. In the first year following the implementation of the plan, Germany would have to pay {{nowrap|1 billion}} marks. This figure would rise to {{nowrap|2.5 billion}} marks per year by the fifth year of the plan. A Reparations Agency was established with Allied representatives to organize the payment of reparations. Furthermore, a loan of {{nowrap|800 million}} marks was to be raised{{mdash}}over 50 per cent coming from the United States, 25 per cent from Britain, and the balance from other European nations{{mdash}}to back the German currency and to aid in the payment of reparations.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=37\u201338}}{{sfn|Crafts|Fearon|2013|pp=82, 114}}\n\n===Young Plan===\n{{Main|Young Plan}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-08968, Er\u00f6ffnung der zweiten Haager Konferenz.jpg|thumb|alt=Great hall containing many people|The opening of the [[Hague conference on reparations|Second Hague Conference]]: one of the two conferences aimed at implementing the Young Plan.]]\n\nThe adoption of the plan was followed by the [[Locarno Treaties]]. The subsequent \"spirit of Locarno\" saw an apparent reconciliation between the European Powers. The implementation of the Dawes Plan also saw a positive economic impact in Europe, largely funded by American loans.{{sfn|Herring|Carroll|1996|p=70}} Under the Dawes Plan, Germany always met her obligations.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=249\u201350}} However, German long term goals reminded the same despite the apparent reconciliation: the revision of the Treaty of Versailles to end reparations. The Dawes Plan was seen only a temporary measure, with expected future revisions.{{sfn|Herring|Carroll|1996|p=70}}{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=249\u201350}} In late 1927, the Agent-General for Reparations \"called for a more permanent scheme\" for payments and in 1928 the Germans followed suit.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=249}} German Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] called for a final reparation plan to be established alongside an early withdrawal of Allied troops from the Rhineland. The French, aware of their weakening political and financial position, acquiesced. On 16 September 1928, a joint Entente-German statement acknowledging the need for a new reparation plan was issued.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=249\u201350}}\n\nIn February 1929, a new committee was formed to re-examine reparations. It was chaired by the American banker [[Owen D. Young]] and presented its findings in June 1929. The \"[[Young Plan]]\" was accepted and was ratified by the German Government on 12 March 1930. The plan established a theoretical final reparation figure at 112&nbsp;billion gold marks {{nowrap|({{USD|26.35 billion}})}}, with a new payment schedule that would see reparations completed by 1988{{mdash}}the first time a final date had been set. In addition, foreign oversight of German finances was to end with the withdrawal of the Reparations Agency, which would be replaced by the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. The bank was established to provide cooperation among central banks and to receive and disburse reparation payments. A further loan of {{Nowrap|{{USD|300 million}}}} was to be raised and given to Germany.{{sfn|Backhaus|2012|p=70}}{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=38}}{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=250\u201351}}{{sfn|Young|2006|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the plan, German payments were half the sum required under the Dawes Plan.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=251\u201352}} The implementation of the Young Plan required the Anglo-French withdrawal from the Rhineland within months.{{sfn|Shamir|1989|p=25}} Despite the reduction, there was increasing German hostility to the plan. For example, the Law against the Enslavement of the German People, or Freedom Law, was proposed by the nationalist politician [[Alfred Hugenberg]]. Hugenberg's proposed law called the of the Ruhr occupation, the official renouncement of the Article 231. and the rejection of the Young Plan. While politicians rejected it, it attracted enough support from voters in order to put up for a referendum. The [[German referendum, 1929|plebiscite]] was held in December 1929, resulting in 5.8 million people out of 6.3 million voters, voting in favor for the law. This fell below the required 21 million votes in order for it to take effect. While this was a political defeat for Hugenberg, it did result in significant national attention for [[Adolf Hitler]] and subsequently valuable right-wing financing.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=251}}{{sfn|Mommsen|Foster|1988|pp=279-281}}{{sfn|Nohlen|St\u00f6ver|2010|p=770}}\n\n===End of German reparations===\n{{Main|Lausanne Conference of 1932}}\n\nIn March 1930, the German Government collapsed and was replaced by a new coalition led by Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]]. In June, Allied troops withdrew from near [[Mainz]]{{mdash}}the last occupation zone in the Rhineland{{mdash}}and Br\u00fcning's Government broached the subject of demanding further refinement to reparations, but this demand was refused by [[William Tyrrell, 1st Baron Tyrrell|William Tyrrell]], the British ambassador to France.{{sfn|Young|2006|pp=171\u201372}} During 1931, a financial crisis began in Germany. In May, [[Creditanstalt]]{{mdash}}the largest bank in Austria{{mdash}}collapsed, sparking a banking crisis in Germany and Austria. In response, Br\u00fcning announced that Germany was suspending reparation payments. This resulted in a massive withdrawal of domestic and foreign funds from German banks. By mid-July, all German banks had closed.{{sfn|Young|2006|p=174}} Until this point, France's policy had been to provide Germany with financial support to help Br\u00fcning's Government stabilize the country. Br\u00fcning, now under considerable political pressure from [[Far-right politics|the far-right]] and [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]], was unable to make any concessions or reverse policy. As a result, Br\u00fcning was unable to borrow money from foreign or domestic sources. Further attempts to enlist British support to end reparations failed; the British said it was a joint issue with France and the United States. In early July, Br\u00fcning announced \"his intention to seek the outright revision of the Young Plan\".{{sfn|Shamir|1989|pp=56\u201358}} In light of the crisis and with the prospect of Germany being unable to repay her debts, United States President [[Herbert Hoover]] intervened. In June, Hoover publicly proposed a one-year [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] to reparation and war debts. By July, the \"[[Hoover Moratorium]]\" had been accepted.{{sfn|Crafts|Fearon|2013|p=155}}\n\nThe moratorium was widely supported in both Germany and the United Kingdom. The French, initially hesitant, eventually agreed to support the American proposal.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1960|p=200}} However, on 13 July, the German [[Danatbank|Darmst\u00e4dter Bank]] collapsed, leading to further bankruptcies and a rise in unemployment further exacerbating Germany's financial crisis.{{sfn|Harsch|2009|p=160}} With the [[Great Depression]] now exerting its influence, the Bank for International Settlements reported that the Young Plan was unrealistic in light of the economic crisis and urged the world governments to reach a new settlement on the various debts they owed each other. During January 1932, Br\u00fcning said he would seek the complete cancellation of reparations. His position was supported by the British and Italians, and opposed by the French.{{sfn|Temin|Toniolo|2008|p=137}}\n\nBecause of the political differences between countries on the subject and impending elections in France and Germany, a conference could not be established until June. This delay brought about the downfall of Br\u00fcning's Government. On 16 June, the Lausanne Conference opened. However, discussions were complicated by the ongoing [[World Disarmament Conference]]. At the latter conference, the US informed the British and French that they would not be allowed to default on their war debts. In turn, they recommended that war debts be tied into German reparation payments, to which the Germans objected. On 9 July, an agreement was reached and signed. The Lausanne Conference annulled the Young Plan and required Germany to pay a final, single installment of 3&nbsp;billion marks, saving France from political humiliation and ending Germany's obligation to pay reparations.{{sfn|Temin|Toniolo|2008|pp=137\u201338}}{{sfn|Mommsen|Foster|1988|p=454}}{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=78}}\n\n===Amount paid by Germany===\nThe precise figure Germany paid is a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Grenville|Wasserstein|2000|p=140}} The German Government estimated it had paid the equivalent of 67.8&nbsp;billion gold marks in reparations. The German figure included{{mdash}}other than gold or goods in kind{{mdash}}the [[scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow]], state property lost in lands ceded to other countries, and the loss of colonial territories.{{sfn|Kindleberger|1986|p=19}} The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements state that {{nowrap|20.598 billion}} gold marks was paid by Germany in reparations, of which {{nowrap|7.595 billion}} was paid before the implementation of the London Schedule of Payments.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=233}} [[Niall Ferguson]] provides a slightly lower figure. He estimates that Germany paid no more than {{nowrap|19 billion}} gold marks.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} Ferguson further estimates that this sum amounted to 2.4 per cent of Germany's national income between 1919 and 1932. Stephen Schuker, in his definitive econometric study, concedes that Germany transferred 16.8&nbsp;billion marks over the whole period, but points out that this sum was vastly offset by the devaluation of Allied paper-mark deposits up to 1923, and by loans that Germany subsequently repudiated after 1924. The net capital transfer into Germany amounted to 17.75&nbsp;billion marks, or 2.1% of Germany's entire national income over the period 1919\u20131931. In effect, America paid Germany four times more, in price-adjusted terms, than the U.S. furnished to West Germany under the post-1948 Marshall Plan.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}}{{sfn|Schuker|1988|p=11, 106-19}}{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=43}} According to [[Gerhard Weinberg]], reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid. However, the burden of repairs was shifted away from the German economy and onto the damaged economies of the war's victors.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=16}} Hans Mommsen wrote \"Germany financed its reparation payments to Western creditor nations with American loans\", which the British and French then used to \"cover their long-term interest obligations and to retire their wartime debts with the United States.\"{{sfn|Mommsen|Foster|1988|p=177}}\n\n===Loan payments===\nTo help make reparations payments, Germany took out various loans during the 1920s. In 1933, following the cancellation of reparations, the new German Chancellor Adolf Hitler cancelled all payments. In June 1953, an [[London Agreement on German External Debts|agreement was reached on this existing debt]] with West Germany. Germany agreed to repay 50 per cent of the loan amounts that had been defaulted on in the 1920s, but deferred some of the debt until West and [[East Germany]] were [[German reunification|unified]]. In 1995, following reunification, Germany began making the final payments towards the loans. A final installment of {{Nowrap|{{USD|94 million}}}} was made on 3 October 2010, settling German loan debts in regard to reparations.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html|title=Why Did World War I Just End? |last1=Suddath|first1=Claire|date=4 October 2010|journal=Time|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Rather, loans were taken out, placing Germany in an economically precarious position as more money entered circulation, destroying the link between paper money and the gold reserve that had been maintained before the war. With its defeat, Germany could not impose reparations and pay off her war debts now, which were now colossal.{{sfn|Peukert|1993|p=62}}\n\nNiall Ferguson partially supports this analysis. He says that had reparations not been imposed, Germany would still have had significant problems caused by the need to pay war debts and the demands of voters for more social services.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=420\u201321}} Ferguson also says that these problems were aggravated by a trade deficit and a weak exchange rate for the mark during 1920. Afterwards, as the value of the mark rose, inflation became a problem. None of these, he says, were the result of reparations.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=413}} Ferguson says that even without reparations, total public spending in Germany between 1920 and 1923 was 33 per cent of total net national product.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=420\u201321}} [[A.J.P. Taylor]] says, \"Germany was a net gainer by the financial transactions of the nineteen-twenties: she borrowed far more from private American investors&nbsp;...&nbsp;than she paid in reparations\".{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=44}} P.M.H. Bell says the creation of a multi-national committee, which resulted in the Dawes Plan, was done to consider ways the German budget could be balanced, the currency stabilized, and the German economy fixed to ease reparation payments.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=37}} [[Max Winkler]] says that from 1924 onward, German officials were \"virtually flooded with loan offers by foreigners\". Overall, he says, the German economy performed reasonably well until the foreign investments funding the economy and the loans funding reparations payments were suddenly withdrawn after the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|1929 Stock Market Crash]]. This collapse was magnified by the volume of loans provided to German companies by US lenders. Even the reduced payments of the Dawes Plan were mainly financed through a large volume of international loans.{{sfn|Winkler|1933|pp=86\u201387}}\n\nWhile Germany initially had a trade deficit, British policy during the early 1920s was to reintegrate Germany into European trade as soon as possible. Likewise, France attempted to secure trade deals with Germany.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=24}} During the mid-to-late 1920s, trade between France and Germany grew rapidly. French imports of German goods \"increased by 60 per cent\", highlighting the close links between French industrial growth and German production, and the increase in cooperation between the countries.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nMax Hantke and Mark Spoerer provide a different perspective on the effect of reparations on the German economy. They say that focusing on the reparations and inflation ignores \"the fact that the restriction of the German military to 115,000 men relieved the German central budget considerably\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=849}} Hantke and Spoerer also say that their findings show \"that even under quite rigorous assumptions the net economic burden of the Treaty of Versailles was much less heavy than has been hitherto thought, in particular if we confine our perspective to the Reich's budget\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=851}} They say, \"though politically a humiliation\", the limitation on the military \"was beneficial in fiscal terms\" and that their economic models show that \"the restriction of the size of the army was clearly beneficial for the Reich budget\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=860}} Additionally, their economic scenarios indicate that while the Treaty of Versailles was \"overall clearly a burden on the German economy\", it \"also offered a substantial peace dividend for Weimar's non-revanchist budget politicians.\" They conclude that, \"The fact that [these politicians] did not make sufficient use of this imposed gift supports the hypothesis that the Weimar Republic suffered from home-made political failure\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=861}}\n\n====Hyperinflation====\n{{further|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\n[[File:Germany Hyperinflation.svg|thumb|alt=A chart with a black line depicting the rapid increase of hyperinflation.|A logarithmic scale depicting Weimar hyperinflation to 1923. One paper Mark per Gold Mark increased to one trillion paper Marks per Gold Mark.]]\n\nErik Goldstein wrote that in 1921, the payment of reparations caused a crisis and that the occupation of the Ruhr had a disastrous effect on the German economy, resulting in the German Government printing more money as the currency collapsed. Hyperinflation began and printing presses worked overtime to print Reichsbank notes; by November 1923 one US dollar was worth {{nowrap|4,200,000,000,000 marks.}}{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=156}} Ferguson writes that the policy of the Economics Minister [[Robert Schmidt (German politician)|Robert Schmidt]] led Germany to avoid economic collapse from 1919 to 1920, but that reparations accounted for most of Germany's deficit in 1921 and 1922 and that reparations were the cause of the hyperinflation.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|pp=409\u201310, 425}}\n\nSeveral historians counter the argument that reparations caused the inflation and collapse of the mark. Gerhard Weinberg writes that Germany refused to pay by, and that doing so destroyed their own currency.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=16}} Anthony Lentin agrees and writes that inflation was \"a consequence of the war rather than of the peace\" and that hyperinflation was a result of the \"German government's reckless issue of paper money\" during the Allied occupation of the Ruhr.{{sfn|Lentin|2012|p=26}} British and French experts believed that the Mark was being sabotaged to avoid budgetary and currency reform and to evade reparations. Sally Marks writes that the Germans claimed that reparations destroyed the Mark. Marks writes that historians who say reparations caused hyperinflation have overlooked \"that the inflation long predated reparations\" and the way \"inflation mushroomed\" between mid-1921 and the end of 1922 \"when Germany was actually paying very little in reparations\" and have failed to explain why \"the period of least inflation coincided with the period of largest reparation payments&nbsp;...&nbsp;or why Germans claimed after 1930 that reparations were causing deflation\". She writes \"there is no doubt that British and French suspicions late in 1922 were sound\".{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=239}} Marks also writes that the \"astronomic inflation which ensued was a result of German policy\", whereby the government paid for passive resistance in the Ruhr \"from an empty exchequer\" and paid off its domestic and war debts with worthless marks.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=245}}{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=24}} Bell agrees and writes that \"inflation had little direct connection with reparation payments themselves, but a great deal to do with the way the German government chose to subsidize industry and to pay the costs of passive resistance to the occupation [of the Ruhr] by extravagant use of the printing press\". Bell also writes that hyperinflation was not an inevitable consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, but was among the actual results.{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=25}}\n\n===Reparations===\n\n====Contemporaneous====\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|<center>John Maynard Keynes in 1933</center>|alt=A seated man looks on the side.]]\n\nAccording to historian Claude Campbell, [[John Maynard Keynes]] \"set the fashion for critics of the economic aspects of the treaty\" and \"made probably the severest and most sweeping indictment of its economic provisions\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=161}} Keynes was temporarily attached to the [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] during the war and was their official representative at the peace conference. He later resigned \"when it became evident that hope could no longer be entertained of substantial modifications in the draft Terms of Peace\" due to the \"policy of the Conference towards the economic problems of Europe\". In 1919, he wrote ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'' based on his objections.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|loc=preface}} He wrote that he believed \"that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible\",{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=146}} and called the treaty a \"[[Carthaginian peace]]\" that would economically affect all of Europe.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|pp=86\u201387}} Keynes said that the treaty's reparation figures \"generally exceed Germany's capacity\" to pay.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=215}} He said that {{USD|10 billion}} was the \"safe maximum figure\", but even then he did \"not believe that [Germany could] pay as much\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=200}} He said the Reparation Commission was a tool that could \"be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic organization as well as to exact payment\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=79}}\n\nIn Keynes' opinion, the reparation figure should have been fixed \"well within Germany's capacity to pay\" so to \"make possible the renewal of hope and enterprise within her territory\" and to \"avoid the perpetual friction and opportunity of improper pressure arising out of the Treaty clauses\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=265}} Keynes identified reparations as the \"main excursion into the economic field\" by the Treaty of Versailles, but said that the treaty excluded provisions for rehabilitating Europe's economies, for improving relations between the Allies and the defeated Central Powers, for stabilizing Europe's new nations, for \"reclaim[ing] Russia\", or for promoting economic solidarity between the Allies.{{sfn|Keynes|1920|p=226}} Coal provides an example of these destabilizing effects in Germany and beyond. Keynes said the \"surrender of the coal will destroy German industry\" but conceding that without coal shipments as reparations, the French and Italian industries damaged directly by the war or indirectly by damage to coal mines would be affected. He writes that this is \"not yet the whole problem\". The repercussions would also affect Central and Northern Europe, and neutral states such as Switzerland and Sweden, which made up for their own coal deficiencies by trading with Germany. Likewise, Keynes said Austria would now be consigned to \"industrial ruin\" as \"nearly all the coalfields of the former Empire lie outside of what is now [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]]\".{{sfn|Keynes|1920|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nCampbell writes that the \"apparent majority did not regard the treaty as perfect\". [[Bernard Baruch]] writes in ''[[The Making of the Reparation and Economic Sections of the Treaty]]'' that most believed it to be the best agreement obtainable under the circumstances and that it was a minority that attacked the treaty, but these attacks \"centered upon its economic provisions\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=160}} [[James T. Shotwell]], writing in ''What Germany Forgot'', said, \"the only 'unendurable servitudes' in the treaty were in the sections on Reparation and the Polish settlement and raised the question as to what part of Germany's grievance against the peace lay in the substance of its exactions and what part in the manner of their imposition\". Sir Andrew McFayden, who also represented the British Treasury at the peace conference and later worked with the Reparation Commission, published his work ''Don't Do it Again''. McFayden's position \"falls somewhere between the views of Keynes and Shotwell\". His attack on reparations \"was as harsh as Keynes\" but he conceded that the \"fault did not lie primarily in the provisions of the treaty but in their execution\". He also believed \"that he Polish settlement was the only readjustment&nbsp;...&nbsp;which was decidedly unwise\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|pp=161\u201362}}\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9]] writes that before the German surrender, Woodrow Wilson dispatched a note to the German Government on 5 November 1918 stating that the Allies \"under-stand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and their property by the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air\", the terms of which they accepted.{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1940|p=15}} Regardless of which, Albrecht-Carri\u00e9 says the reparation section of the treaty proved \"to be a dismal failure\".{{sfn|Albrecht-Carri\u00e9|1940|p=16}} Campbell says, \"although there was much in the peace that was 'petty, unjust, and humiliating', there was little aside from reparation clauses and certain territorial concessions, which had much real bearing upon Germany's economic future\".{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=162}} Summarizing the view of economists throughout the 1920s, she says the territorial changes to Germany were \"not necessarily&nbsp;...&nbsp;economically unsound\", but than the removal of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and territory to Poland \"depriv[ed] Germany of her resources in excess of the amount necessary to fulfill the legitimate economic demands of the victors&nbsp;...&nbsp;[and] was indefensible\". Campbell also said the treaty failed to include \"provisions looking to the restoration of Germany to her former position as the chief economic and financial stabilizing influence in central Europe\" and that this was economically shortsighted and was an economic failing of the treaty.{{sfn|Campbell|1942|p=163}}\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Mantoux]], a French economist, was the harshest contemporaneous critic of Keynes. In his posthumously published book, ''The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes'', Mantoux said that Keynes \"had been wrong on various counts, especially with respect to his predictions about Germany's coal, iron and steel production&nbsp;...&nbsp;and its level of national saving\".{{sfn|Cord|2013|p=41}} Keynes said Europe's overall output of iron would decrease; Mantoux said the opposite occurred. By 1929, European iron output had increased by ten per cent from that of 1913. Keynes believed that this European trend would also affect German iron and steel production. Mantoux says this prediction was also incorrect. By 1927, German steel output had increased by 30 per cent and iron output increased by 38 per cent from 1913. Keynes predicted that German coal extraction would also decrease and that Germany would not be able to export coal immediately after the war. Mantoux also counters these arguments. By 1920, German was exporting 15 million tons of coal a year and reached 35&nbsp;million tons by 1926. By 1929, German coal mining had risen by 30 per cent on the 1913 figures because of her increased labor efficiency methods. In regard to national savings, Keynes stated that 2&nbsp;billion marks would only be possible after the adoption of the treaty. Mantoux says that the 1925 German national savings figure was estimated at 6.4&nbsp;billion marks, rising to 7.6&nbsp;billion marks by 1927.{{sfn|Mantoux|1952|pp=162\u201363}} Mantoux calculated that Germany borrowed between 8&nbsp;billion and 35&nbsp;billion marks in the period 1920\u20131931, while only paying 21&nbsp;billion in reparations. This, he says, allowed Germany to re-equip, expand, and modernize her industry.{{sfn|Henig|1995|p=62}} Highlighting the rearmament under Hitler, Mantoux said Germany \"had been in a stronger position to pay reparations than Keynes had made out\".{{sfn|Cord|2013|p=41}} He also says that Germany could have paid all of the reparations if she had wanted to, and that the problem was not that Germany was unable to pay, but that she was unwilling to pay.{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=70}}\n\nIn 1954, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]]{{mdash}}one of the authors of Article 231{{mdash}}said that, \"Efforts to bankrupt and humiliate a nation merely incite a people of vigor and of courage to break the bonds imposed upon them&nbsp;...&nbsp;Prohibitions thus incite the very acts that are prohibited.\"{{sfn|Immerman|1998|p=10}}\n\n====Modern====\n\n[[Geoff Harcourt]] writes that Keynes' arguments that reparations would lead to German economic collapse have been adopted \"by historians of almost all political persuasions\" and have influenced the way historians and the public \"see the unfolding events in Germany and the decades between Versailles and the outbreak of the Second World War\". He says Mantoux's work \"is not simply a critique of Keynes\", but \"a stimulus to question the received wisdom's interpretation of the unfolding events in Germany\". Harcourt says that despite it discussing Keynes' errors \"in great detail\", Mantoux's work \"has not led us to revise our general judgment of Keynes\", yet \"it does make us question the soundness of theoretical and empirical aspects\" of his arguments.{{sfn|Harcourt|2012|p=21}} A.J.P. Taylor writes that in 1919 \"many people believed that the payment of reparations would reduce Germany to a state of Asiatic poverty\", and that Keynes \"held this view, as did all Germans; and probably many Frenchmen\". However, he also says these \"apprehensions of Keynes and the Germans were grotesquely exaggerated\".{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=44}}\n\nAccording to Martel, Taylor \"shrewdly concludes that \u00c9tienne Mantoux had the better of his controversy with John Maynard Keynes\".{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=42}} Stephen Schuker writes that Keynes' \"tendentious but influential\" book was \"ably refuted\" by Mantoux.{{sfn|Schuker|1988|p=7}} [[Richard J. Evans]] says \"the economic history of the 1920s and early 1930s seemed to confirm\" the arguments of Keynes, yet \"as we now know\" Keynes' reparation arguments were wrong. Evans says the economic problems that arose were a result of the inflation of 1923, which lay with the German government rather than reparations.{{sfn|Evans|2008|loc=Hitler and the Origins of the War}}\n\nAccording to Slavieck, the \"traditional interpretation of the treaty's impact on Germany\" was that it \"plunged the nation into an economic free fall\".{{sfn|Slavicek|2010|p=95}} This view was shared by the German people, who believed the treaty was robbing Germany of its wealth. German banker [[Max Warburg]] said the terms of the treaty were \"pillage on a global scale\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=401}} Niall Ferguson says the German view was incorrect and \"not many historians would today agree with Warburg\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} However, several historians agree with Warburg.  [[Norman Davies]] writes that the treaty forced Germany to \"pay astronomic reparations\",{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=133}} while Tim McNeese states, \"France and Britain had placed war damages on Germany to the tune of billions of gold marks, which the defeated Germans could not begin to pay in earnest\".{{sfn|McNeese|2010|p=19}} Ferguson says the reparations were \"less of a burden than Keynes and others claimed\" and that the \"potential burden on national income of the annuity vary from 5 percent to 10 percent\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=424}} However, he cautions against underestimating the initial German effort to pay. Before the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany transferred between eight and 13&nbsp;billion gold marks, which amounted to \"between 4 and 7 percent of total national income\". Ferguson says \"the annuity demanded in 1921 put an intolerable strain on the state's finances\" and that total expenditure between 1920 and 1923 amounted to \"at least 50 percent of Reich revenue, 20 percent of total Reich spending and 10 percent of total public spending\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=425}} Thus, Ferguson says, reparations \"undermined confidence in the Reich's creditworthiness\" and \"''were'' therefore excessive{{mdash}}as the German government claimed\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=426}}\n\nHantke and Spoerer write that \"reparation payments were indeed a severe economic burden for Germany\" and that \"the German economy was deprived of between one and 2.2&nbsp;billion Reichsmark (RM) annually, which amounted in the late 1920s to nearly 2.5 per cent of Germany's GDP\".{{sfn|Hantke|Spoerer|2010|p=849}} [[Gerald Feldman]] writes, \"there can be no question that the entire London schedule could be viewed as a way of reducing the reparations bill without the Allied publics being fully informed of what was going on. This was recognized by at least some German politicians, one of whom optimistically argued that 'the entente will only demand the 50&nbsp;billion marks, not the rest. They have only called for the rest for domestic political reasons.'\"{{sfn|Feldman|1997|p=339}} Feldman also says the prospect that the 'C' bonds would be evoked hung over the German Government like a \"[[Damocles|Damocles Sword]]\".{{sfn|Feldman|1997|p=430}} In addition to Feldman and Ferguson's opposition, Peter Kruger, Barry Eichengreen, and Steven Webb agree that \"the initial German effort to pay reparations\" was substantial and \"produced an immense strain\" on the German economy.{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=445-6}}\n\nSeveral historians take the middle ground between condemning reparations and supporting the argument that they were not a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, \"Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy\" as had been feared, however the \"psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system\".{{sfn|Peukert|1993|p=197}} P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a \"strain on the German balance of payments\", they could be paid and were \"compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry\".{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=38}} According to Martel, [[Robert Boyce]] said reparations were \"a heavy burden on Germany, both as a financial charge&nbsp;...&nbsp;and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments\". However, he says that while \"Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations\" this was far from the truth, and that \"&nbsp;...&nbsp;Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad\".{{sfn|Martel|2010|p=183}} William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, \"an increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt\".{{sfn|Boemeke|Feldman|Glaser|1998|p=502}} However, [[Charles Feinstein]] writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans \"to accept even a modest increase in taxation to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries\". Feinstein says that \"even if the economic aspects&nbsp;...&nbsp;were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany\".{{sfn|Feinstein|1995|p=32}}\n\nSally Marks writes, \"There are those&nbsp;...&nbsp;who claim reparations were unpayable. In financial terms, that is untrue&nbsp;...&nbsp;Of course Germans did not want to pay; nobody ever wants to pay, and Weimar was determined not to do so&nbsp;...&nbsp;Raising taxes would have provided ample funds&nbsp;...&nbsp;Weimar could have borrowed from the citizenry, as France did after 1871 [to pay its indemnity to Germany]\".{{sfn|Marks|2013|pp=632\u201359}} Marks writes that Germany could have easily paid the 50&nbsp;billion marks in reparations, but instead chose to repeatedly default on payments as part of a political strategy of undermining Versailles.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=255}} Marks says that in 1921, Germany met her requirements in full because custom posts were occupied by Allied troops.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=237}} Once the Allies had relinquished control of the customs posts, Germany made no further payments in cash until 1924 following the implementation of the Dawes Plan.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=238}} Marks says that while Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles \"established an unlimited theoretical liability\", Article 232 limited German responsibility to pay only for civilian damages. When the 1921 London conference to determine how much Germany should pay was called, the Allies calculated on the basis of what Germany could pay, not on their own needs.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=232}} In this way, Marks says, the Germans largely escaped paying for the war and instead shifted the costs onto American investors.{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=254}} Marks states that the delay in establishing a final total until 1921, \"was actually in Germany's interest\" because the figures discussed at the peace conference were \"astronomic\". She says, \"The British experts, Lords [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Sumner]] and [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Cunliffe]], were so unrealistic that they were nicknamed [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|'the heavenly twins']].\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=233}} Marks also says, \"much ink has been wasted on the fact that civilian damages were stretched to cover war widows' pensions and allowances for military dependents\". As reparations were based on what Germany could pay, Marks says the inclusion of such items did not affect German liability but altered distribution of reparations; the \"inclusion of pensions and allowances increased the British share of the pie but did not enlarge the pie.\"{{sfn|Marks|1978|p=232}}\n\nBernadotte Schmitt writes that if \"pensions and separation allowances&nbsp;...&nbsp;not been included, reparations would probably never have become the bogey that poisoned the post-war world for so many years.{{sfn|Schmitt|1960|p=107}} Taylor says, \"no doubt the impoverishment of Germany was caused by war, not by reparations. Not doubt the Germans could have paid reparations, if they had regarded them as an obligation of honour, honestly incurred.\" However, he says, \"reparations&nbsp; ...&nbsp;kept the passions of war alive\".{{sfn|Taylor|1991|p=44}} Peter Liberman writes that while the Germans believed they could not meet such demands of them, the \"French believed that Germany could pay and only lacked the requisite will\" to do so. Liberman says this is \"a position that has gained support from recent historical research\". In regard to Germany's capacity to pay, he focuses on coal and says that German coal consumption per capita was higher than France's despite coal shipments being consistently short.

She\u2019s not a love interest\u2014she\u2019s this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation.\" On the relationship between Temple and Murdock in ''Daredevil'', Dawson said, \"The show explores how necessary it is for two people to finally have their masks off with each other. For Matt Murdock, this is the first person he has that\u2019s going to be able to see that transition for him ... But she gets confronted with the question: How far will you go?

She's someone\u2014hero or not\u2014you'd want to have in a dire situation...

You know, this is someone who helps people, and she's been violent now but seeing the need for it. I think there's a lot that she's having to grapple with\".<ref name=\"DawsonMTV\" /> Discussing Temple's relationship with Cage in ''Luke Cage'', Colter said that \"she will deal with me in a different way than she dealt with Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock's character's completely different from mine. Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need ...

The series introduces Temple's mother (portrayed by [[S\u00f4nia Braga]]), and gives Claire \"a large storyline ... [she helps] out a lot.\"<ref name=\"TempleLC\" /> It also references her role as a version of Night Nurse, with [[Sean Ringgold]]'s character Sugar dismissively referring to her as \"the night nurse\".<ref name=\"NNLC\" /> Explaining the decision to have Temple appear across multiple series, which has been compared to the role that [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] plays as \"the connective thread\" between the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU films]],<ref name=\"NickFuryMTV\" /><ref name=\"NickFuryCB\" /> Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]] explained that it was due to Dawson's performance, saying \"It wasn't just that Claire fit so well in those worlds, it's that Rosario fit so well in those worlds.\"<ref name=\"TempleLC\" /> When Temple first appears in the second season of ''Daredevil'', she has \"a cut in her eyebrow\", which Daredevil actor [[Charlie Cox]] explained was from one of the other series, saying that \"the timeline had been thought through and worked out\" to connect Dawson's various performances.<ref name=\"DawsonExplain\" />\n\nIn July 2016, Dawson was unable to promote ''Luke Cage'' because she was \"back in New York ... filming something else for Marvel TV\",<ref name=\"DawsonIF?\" /> which was confirmed that October to be ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]''; this appearance was set up at the end of ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"DawsonIF\" /> A month later, Dawson was revealed to also be reprising her role in the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''.<ref name=\"DawsonDefenders\" /> Dawson also expressed interest in making a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', a spin-off series from ''Daredevil'', but was unable to due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name=\"DawsonNoPunisher\" />\n\n{{Quote box|quote=I wanted it to really honor this journey I\u2019ve had with her, and what she\u2019s been and what she\u2019s stood for, and what she means to a lot of people ... because [she shows that] you don\u2019t have to have special superpowers to make a difference and an impact in your community and to challenge yourself to grow and to be greater.

She did think that she would return to ''Luke Cage'' if it was renewed for further seasons, and again expressed interest in appearing in ''The Punisher'' at some point moving forward \"just so I can feel like I\u2019ve done every show\".<ref name=\"DawsonFuture\" /> Dawson later revealed that she had asked ''Luke Cage'' showrunner [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] whether she could contribute to the writing of Temple's last scene in the season; she considered the scene to be the culmination of three years of work for her, and felt that it had initially been written too much from the perspective of Cage, whom Temple has a fight with in the scene that ends their relationship. Dawson praised Coker for allowing her to push the scene to feature more of an equal balance between the characters, and Coker praised the work she did on this.<ref name=\"DawsonLastScene\" />\n\n== Characterization ==\nDawson said in April 2015, \"she\u2019s someone who also throws herself into the fray and had made it her life mission to help, even if that means risking her own life ... My character is a stand-in for the audience. She\u2019s not a love interest\u2014she\u2019s this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation.\" On the relationship between Temple and Murdock in ''Daredevil'', Dawson said, \"The show explores how necessary it is for two people to finally have their masks off with each other. For Matt Murdock, this is the first person he has that\u2019s going to be able to see that transition for him ... But she gets confronted with the question: How far will you go? What does it mean if you\u2019re helping someone who is maybe going to hurt other people?\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" />\n\nDawson felt that the character resonated with audiences, and was brought back for more series, because, \"She's funny, she's wry, she's strong\u2014she's built for that world, because she's great under pressure. She's someone\u2014hero or not\u2014you'd want to have in a dire situation... I really just liked her arc all the way through.\" After the character is shown using fighting in ''Daredevil'', Dawson explained, \"her eyes have been opened up to this other world\u2014and she's crossed the line. You know, this is someone who helps people, and she's been violent now but seeing the need for it. I think there's a lot that she's having to grapple with\".<ref name=\"DawsonMTV\" /> Discussing Temple's relationship with Cage in ''Luke Cage'', Colter said that \"she will deal with me in a different way than she dealt with Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock's character's completely different from mine. Because she plays a nurse that basically seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she's very good at helping out superheroes who are in need ... I think she's going to be a very good companion for Luke. I think she's someone that Luke needs in his life at this time.\"<ref name=\"TempleLC\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"DawsonCast\">{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/2014/6/20/22725/rosario_dawson_joins_marvels_daredevil_for_netflix |title=Rosario Dawson Joins Marvel's Daredevil For Netflix |date=June 20, 2014 |website=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905195945/http://marvel.com/news/tv/2014/6/20/22725/rosario_dawson_joins_marvels_daredevil_for_netflix |archive-date=September 5, 2014 |access-date=June 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NYCC2014\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/22408-nycc-2014-marvel-s-daredevil-on-netflix-panel-live.html |title=NYCC 2014: Marvel's DAREDEVIL on Netflix Panel LIVE!
