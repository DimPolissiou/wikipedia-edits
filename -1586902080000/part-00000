The earl's absolute control over Warwickshire's administration caused a large number of people to depart the county, not 'willing to be judged by' the earl, or his officials, chief amongst, them being de Herle. In February 1345, de Herle was required by the king, along with others in the administration 'to provide a list of those who were refusing to be judged by him'.\n\nShortly thereafter, in the July 1345 he was in the group Warwick had entrusted some of his lands to, as marriage settlements for his daughters. In 1355 and 1357 Sir Robert Herle fought in the Scottish Campaign where he received substantial rewards for the return of a number of prisoners.\n\nHerle was one of the \u2018bachelors\u2019 of Warwick's household during times of peace, and was required to attend the earl at tournaments and in the event of war.\n\nWarwick granted Herle the wardenship of [[Barnard Castle]] along with its forests and lands, this, it has been stated made Herle a pivotal figure in the running of the earl's estates. Herle's was further granted a lifetime lease on several lands and rents in the vicinity of the Castle.\n\n\"''In September 1343, Herle obtained a pardon of the king's suit for homicides, felonies, robberies and larcenies perpetrated by him and any consequent outlawries, and it is noted that the pardon was sealed personally in front of Edward III and Thomas, earl of Warwick.''\"\n\nRobert Herle was associated with the Bassett family of [[Drayton Bassett|Drayton]] in 1339 as retainer to the Bassett manors of [[Moulton, Northamptonshire|Moulton]], [[Long Buckby|Buckby]], [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] and [[Walsall]].\n\n==Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports==\n\nUntil now all lists state that the Lord Warden of the [[Cinque Ports]] for the year 1361 was Sir Richard de Herle, this was however not the case and in fact the appointment was granted to Sir Robert Herle.

Due to the intensity of the [[Battle|firefight]], the company medical assistant was [[pinned down]] and could not help for over 20 minutes, during which time Croucher stabilised the casualty until he could be evacuated.

He was part of a reconnaissance mission near [[Sangin]] in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] on 9 February 2008. Moving through a compound at night he felt a trip-wire against his leg and saw that he had activated a grenade. He threw himself to the ground, and used his [[Backpack|rucksack]] to pin the grenade to the floor, and tucked his legs up to his body.  He was thrown some distance by the explosion, but due to the protection offered by his rucksack and body-armour, suffered only a nose-bleed, perforated ear drums and some disorientation.  The pack was ripped from his back by the explosion, and his body armour and helmet were pitted by grenade fragments. Of the other three members of his patrol, the rear man managed to take cover by retreating round the corner of a building; the patrol commander threw himself to ground, and received a superficial face wound from a grenade fragment; and the final team member did not have time to react, and remained on his feet, and would have been within the lethal range of the grenade but for Croucher's action.  The explosion breached a large [[lithium battery]] which was in Croucher's pack to power the patrol's [[electronic countermeasures]] equipment, causing it to burst into flames.  A medic recommended that he be evacuated, but he insisted on continuing as the members of the patrol realised that Taliban fighters would probably come to investigate the explosion, and this would give the marines the opportunity to ambush them; the ambush was successful, and Croucher himself killed a Taliban fighter.<ref name=gazette /><ref>{{Cite news| title = Marine who threw himself on exploding grenade to protect comrades awarded George Cross|work=Daily Mail |location=UK| date = 23 July 2008| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1037353/Marine-threw-exploding-grenade-protect-comrades-awarded-George-Cross.html| accessdate =23 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last = Grey| first = Stephen| title = Lance Corporal Matt Croucher hurls himself onto Taliban grenade|work=The Sunday Times |location=UK| publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]]| date = 30 March 2008| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3646243.ece| accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nCroucher was initially put forward for the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the highest decoration for valour in the [[British Armed Forces]].

Due to the intensity of the [[Battle|firefight]], the company medical assistant was [[pinned down]] and could not help for over 20 minutes, during which time Croucher stabilised the casualty until he could be evacuated.

He was part of a reconnaissance mission near [[Sangin]] in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] on 9 February 2008. Moving through a compound at night he felt a trip-wire against his leg and saw that he had activated a grenade. He threw himself to the ground, and used his [[Backpack|rucksack]] to pin the grenade to the floor, and tucked his legs up to his body.  He was thrown some distance by the explosion, but due to the protection offered by his rucksack and body-armour, suffered only a nose-bleed, perforated ear drums and some disorientation.  The pack was ripped from his back by the explosion, and his body armour and helmet were pitted by grenade fragments. Of the other three members of his patrol, the rear man managed to take cover by retreating round the corner of a building; the patrol commander threw himself to ground, and received a superficial face wound from a grenade fragment; and the final team member did not have time to react, and remained on his feet, and would have been within the lethal range of the grenade but for Croucher's action.  The explosion breached a large [[lithium battery]] which was in Croucher's pack to power the patrol's [[electronic countermeasures]] equipment, causing it to burst into flames.  A medic recommended that he be evacuated, but he insisted on continuing as the members of the patrol realised that Taliban fighters would probably come to investigate the explosion, and this would give the marines the opportunity to ambush them; the ambush was successful, and Croucher himself killed a Taliban fighter.<ref name=gazette /><ref>{{Cite news| title = Marine who threw himself on exploding grenade to protect comrades awarded George Cross|work=Daily Mail |location=UK| date = 23 July 2008| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1037353/Marine-threw-exploding-grenade-protect-comrades-awarded-George-Cross.html| accessdate =23 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last = Grey| first = Stephen| title = Lance Corporal Matt Croucher hurls himself onto Taliban grenade|work=The Sunday Times |location=UK| publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]]| date = 30 March 2008| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3646243.ece| accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nCroucher was initially put forward for the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the highest decoration for valour in the [[British Armed Forces]].
