In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its \"distinguished service\" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.\n\nSunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course \"Elements of the Law\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]].

The motion passed in a 63\u201335 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57\u201340 vote.\n\nIn his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.\n\nSunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political?

Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]]. He recanted many of the views expressed in the book before his confirmation as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in order to receive Senate confirmation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Asked by [[Rudy Takala]] if Sunstein's views nonetheless persisted in the Obama administration, [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] Commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] eluded the question, answering, \"Everybody needs a nudge, right?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rudy-takala/fcc-commissioner-speaks-out-against-federal-regulation-internet |title=FCC Commissioner Speaks Out Against Federal Regulation of Internet |work=CNSNews.com |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\nSunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that\n\n<blockquote>People often make poor choices \u2013 and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nThe ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}</ref> The \"Nudge\" idea has also been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said:\n<blockquote>We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behavior changes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nContributing to the anthology ''Our American Story'' (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative.

He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a \"Sunstein number\" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erd\u0151s number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990).

Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.\n\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\" argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>\n\nSunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].  In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term \"[[choice architecture|choice architect]].\"<ref name=Nudge />\n\n===Military commissions===\nIn 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\" and that \"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\" Sunstein scorned as \"ludicrous\" an argument from law professor [[George P. Fletcher]], who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis.<ref name=milcom>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/military-tribunal-debate|title=The Military Tribunal Debate|work=The American Prospect}}</ref> In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5\u20133 vote.\n\n===First Amendment===\nIn his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace \"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\"<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to \"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\"<ref name=\"Cass R.

[[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=snippet&q=bring%20suit&f=false page 11] of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nSunstein has argued, \"We should celebrate tax day.\"<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public\u2026 There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSunstein goes on to say:\n<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between \"negative\" and \"positive\" rights makes little sense.

He continues, \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\" He goes on further, \"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \"official license scheme.\"<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |authorlink= |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>\nSunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration ===\nSunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\"  They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as \"extremist groups.\"\n\nThe authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\"\n\nSunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\" This position has been criticized by some commentators<ref>[http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231203/http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ |date=January 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121133714/http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews |date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/15/sunstein/index.html |title=Obama confidant's spine-chilling proposal |work=Salon.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory''.

On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[Coronavirus pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that \u201c[a] lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\u201d and that they have \u201can exaggerated sense of their own personal risk.\u201d He argued that \u201cmost people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\u201d In his view, there was \u201cno adequate reason\u201d to change travel plans or other socioeconomic behaviors, since they risk \u201cplummeting stock prices.\u201d In the face of this, Sunstein urged calm and cautioned leaders to weigh the costs of merely potentially saving lives against the actual costs of falling prices in corporate equities. He blamed this tendency to view possibly saving lives as better than actually saving money on \"probability neglect,\" a term that he invented.\n\nA few weeks later Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \u201con the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can\u2019t Be Too Careful|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n\nIn 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that \"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\" comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as \"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"Star Wars,\" he writes, \"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\" is \"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with the [[AV Club]], Sunstein stated that he felt \"over the moon about ''Star Wars''.\" The film franchise, in his view, \"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\" and includes many \"puzzles\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:\n\n:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don\u2019t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels\n\nSunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \"episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard.<ref>.https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg=PR15&dq=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl=lt&sig=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1</ref> She is Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], specializing in British modernism.<ref>.http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa-ruddick</ref> Their marriage ended in divorce.

In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its \"distinguished service\" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.\n\nSunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course \"Elements of the Law\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]].

Anticipated areas of study include terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and other low-probability, high-consequence events. Sunstein plans to rely on significant student involvement in the work of this new program.<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Sunstein would be named to head the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs|White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] (OIRA).<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisman |first=Jonathan |last2=Bravin |first2=Jess |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123138051682263203 |title=Obama's Regulatory Czar Likely to Set a New Tone |work=Wall Street Journal |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivereform.org/SunsteinOIRA.cfm |title=Choices for OIRA: Reinvigorating Protection of Health, Safety, and the Environment |publisher=Center for Progressive Reform |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> and environmentalists.<ref>https://thinkprogress.org/how-anti-regulation-is-obamas-new-regulatory-czar-bb113a8eaf27/</ref>Sunstein's confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views.

The motion passed in a 63\u201335 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57\u201340 vote.\n\nIn his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.\n\nSunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political? An Empirical Analysis of the Federal Judiciary'' (2005), ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'' (2006), and, co-authored with [[Richard Thaler]], ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' (2008).\n\nSunstein's 2006 book, ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'', explores methods for aggregating information; it contains discussions of [[prediction market]]s, [[open-source software]], and [[wiki]]s. Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]]. He recanted many of the views expressed in the book before his confirmation as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in order to receive Senate confirmation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Asked by [[Rudy Takala]] if Sunstein's views nonetheless persisted in the Obama administration, [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] Commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] eluded the question, answering, \"Everybody needs a nudge, right?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rudy-takala/fcc-commissioner-speaks-out-against-federal-regulation-internet |title=FCC Commissioner Speaks Out Against Federal Regulation of Internet |work=CNSNews.com |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\nSunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that\n\n<blockquote>People often make poor choices \u2013 and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nThe ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}</ref> The \"Nudge\" idea has also been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said:\n<blockquote>We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behavior changes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nContributing to the anthology ''Our American Story'' (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative.

He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a \"Sunstein number\" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erd\u0151s number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990).

Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.\n\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\" argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>\n\nSunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].  In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term \"[[choice architecture|choice architect]].\"<ref name=Nudge />\n\n===Military commissions===\nIn 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\" and that \"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\" Sunstein scorned as \"ludicrous\" an argument from law professor [[George P. Fletcher]], who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis.<ref name=milcom>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/military-tribunal-debate|title=The Military Tribunal Debate|work=The American Prospect}}</ref> In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5\u20133 vote.\n\n===First Amendment===\nIn his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace \"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\"<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to \"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\"<ref name=\"Cass R.

[[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=snippet&q=bring%20suit&f=false page 11] of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nSunstein has argued, \"We should celebrate tax day.\"<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public\u2026 There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSunstein goes on to say:\n<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between \"negative\" and \"positive\" rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of religion \u2013 just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps \u2013 are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness'', Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. \"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\" argues Sunstein. He continues, \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\" He goes on further, \"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \"official license scheme.\"<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |authorlink= |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>\nSunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration ===\nSunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\"  They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as \"extremist groups.\"\n\nThe authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\"\n\nSunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\" This position has been criticized by some commentators<ref>[http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231203/http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ |date=January 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121133714/http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews |date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/15/sunstein/index.html |title=Obama confidant's spine-chilling proposal |work=Salon.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory''.

On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[Coronavirus pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that \u201c[a] lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\u201d and that they have \u201can exaggerated sense of their own personal risk.\u201d He argued that \u201cmost people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\u201d In his view, there was \u201cno adequate reason\u201d to change travel plans or other socioeconomic behaviors, since they risk \u201cplummeting stock prices.\u201d In the face of this, Sunstein urged calm and cautioned leaders to weigh the costs of merely potentially saving lives against the actual costs of falling prices in corporate equities. He blamed this tendency to view possibly saving lives as better than actually saving money on \"probability neglect,\" a term that he invented.\n\nA few weeks later Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \u201con the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can\u2019t Be Too Careful|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n\nIn 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that \"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\" comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as \"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"Star Wars,\" he writes, \"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\" is \"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with the [[AV Club]], Sunstein stated that he felt \"over the moon about ''Star Wars''.\" The film franchise, in his view, \"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\" and includes many \"puzzles\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:\n\n:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don\u2019t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels\n\nSunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \"episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard.<ref>.https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg=PR15&dq=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl=lt&sig=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1</ref> She is Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], specializing in British modernism.<ref>.http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa-ruddick</ref> Their marriage ended in divorce.

Following the live band setting of the band's previous album, 1994's ''[[Beat about the Bush]]'', the duo sought a simpler sound that featured just themselves, with the duo trying to capture their live sound, which included experimenting with [[DI unit]]s and making the maximum use of [[pickup (music technology)|pick-ups]] and [[pre-amplifier]]s. The album was produced by Gerard O'Farrell, who by this point had become the band's manager, and recorded in July 1995 in [[Bredon]], [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nIt was released in 1995 by Isis Records, before being re-rereleased by the duo's own label [[Hands on Music]] re-released the album in 1996 after the original version went [[out of print]]. The album was a turning point for the band, featuring major press attention from magazines such as ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' and ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', the latter naming it \"folk album of the year\".<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |url=http://www.showofhands.co.uk/about/show-of-hands-full-biog/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128115349/http://www.showofhands.co.uk/about/show-of-hands-full-biog/ |archivedate=2015-01-28 }}</ref> Oldies.com note that the album was \"considered one of that year\u2019s finest folk releases.\"<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Show-Of-Hands.html Show Of Hands Biography | OLDIES.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter folk musician [[Phil Beer]] left [[The Albion Band]] in late 1990, it allowed he and [[Steve Knightley]] to treat their project Show of Hands as a full-time musical collaboration.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Show of Hands' work prior to Beer's departure from The Albion Band consisted of two albums, ''[[Show of Hands (1987 album)|Show of Hands]]'' (1987) and ''[[Tall Ships (album)|Tall Ships]]'' (1990). The newly prioritised Show of Hands recorded ''[[Out for the Count]]'' at The Old Court in 1991, and released it on cassette that year, sold at the band's live performances.<ref>''Backlog 1987\u20131991'' liner notes</ref> The duo briefly entered a hiatus as Show of Hands to allow to form the Anglo-Chilean band [[Alianza (Anglo-Chilean band)|Alianza]] with [[Dave Townsend]] with three Chilean musicians, exploring [[world music]]. They released a [[Alianza (album)|self-titled album]] in 1992, becoming Knightley and Beer's first CD release. During the Alianza project, the duo recorded a performance from 8 June 1992 at [[Bridport]]'s Bull Hotel, working with engineer Mike Trim and released it on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as ''[[Show of Hands Live]]'', the duo's first CD, but by the time of its release, the band's previous three albums were out of print.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Roots: The Best of Show of Hands'' liner notes</ref>\n\nThe duo recorded their first, and only, studio album for TWAH! Records, ''[[Beat about the Bush]]'', in January 1994, and it was released the following month. Produced by Trim, due to his successful work on ''Show of Hands Live'', he and the duo aimed for an \"elusive \"radio friendly\" folk/roots album that retained the band's live sound whilst adding a [[rhythm section]].<ref>''[[Roots: The Best of Show of Hands]]'' liner notes.</ref> Whilst the album did not attract much radio attention as the duo had wanted,<ref name=autogenerated5>''[[Roots: The Best of Show of Hands]]'' liner notes</ref> it helped make the duo more popular and built upon their fan base. The duo left TWAH! Records and signed to Isis Records, the label which saw the original release of ''Lie of the Land''.\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Guitar onboard preamp.png|thumb|The duo made maximum use of their instrument [[pre-amplifier]]s (''acoustic guitar pre-amp pictured'').]]\n''Lie of the Land'' was recorded in July 1995 at Free for Good Studios, Bredon, near [[Tewkesbury]] in [[Gloucestershire]],<ref>Liner notes</ref> a studio which belongs to Dave Pick and whose name is often initialised to FFG.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> This is the first time the duo recorded a studio album outside of [[Devon]] or [[Dorset]]. The album was then mixed at Sonica Studios, [[London]], in August 1995.<ref>Liner notes.</ref>  There are two traditional tracks on the album and ten Knightley compositions, including a re-recording of \"Exile\", one of the duo's earlier songs which had featured on [[Show of Hands (1987 album)|their first album]].\n\nThe album was produced by Gerard O'Farrell, and displays a simpler, stripped-down folk sound, as opposed to the full-band set up that the duo had used on their previous album, ''Beat about the Bush'', which the duo did not see as successful as wanted. On this album, the duo tried to capture their live sound by recording all the instruments using a [[DI unit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomrobinson.com/writing/soh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321024206/http://www.tomrobinson.com/writing/soh.htm |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}</ref> The band had originally hired O'Farrell, an engineer/producer, for their live shows, following the release of ''Beat About the Bush''. By the time he produced ''Lie of the Land'', nonetheless, he was now the duo's [[Talent manager|manager]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nKnightley said in an interview two years later that \"normally when people take acoustic instruments into a studio they get the mikes out. Like, 'sorry everyone - that may be what you heard live but now it's going to sound like a PROPER acoustic guitar.' Gerard [O'Farrell] was saying from his point of view the D.I. is what makes us sound different and it can kick in effects at a massive rate. The thump you get from the pickup is what turns the music into [[acoustic rock]].\"<ref name=autogenerated4 /> He also later summed up the recording by noting \"overdubs were minimal\" and that the duo \"made maximum use of [their] instrument [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]]s and [[pre-amp]]s.\"<ref>''Roots: The Best of Show of Hands''</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe album was released in October 1995 on the [[independent record label]] Isis Records. Later, after releasing the duo's compilation album ''Backlog 1987\u20131991'', it became was their first studio album to be released on the duo's own label [[Hands on Music]], having re-issued the album. Their debut album, ''[[Beat about the Bush]]'', was originally released on TWAH! Records before it was re-released on Hands on Music in 1999. The album cover was designed by Rob O'Connor, who also designed the cover for their previous album, ''Beat about the Bush''.

Following the live band setting of the band's previous album, 1994's ''[[Beat about the Bush]]'', the duo sought a simpler sound that featured just themselves, with the duo trying to capture their live sound, which included experimenting with [[DI unit]]s and making the maximum use of [[pickup (music technology)|pick-ups]] and [[pre-amplifier]]s. The album was produced by Gerard O'Farrell, who by this point had become the band's manager, and recorded in July 1995 in [[Bredon]], [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nIt was released in 1995 by Isis Records, before being re-rereleased by the duo's own label [[Hands on Music]] re-released the album in 1996 after the original version went [[out of print]]. The album was a turning point for the band, featuring major press attention from magazines such as ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' and ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', the latter naming it \"folk album of the year\".<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |url=http://www.showofhands.co.uk/about/show-of-hands-full-biog/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128115349/http://www.showofhands.co.uk/about/show-of-hands-full-biog/ |archivedate=2015-01-28 }}</ref> Oldies.com note that the album was \"considered one of that year\u2019s finest folk releases.\"<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Show-Of-Hands.html Show Of Hands Biography | OLDIES.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter folk musician [[Phil Beer]] left [[The Albion Band]] in late 1990, it allowed he and [[Steve Knightley]] to treat their project Show of Hands as a full-time musical collaboration.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Show of Hands' work prior to Beer's departure from The Albion Band consisted of two albums, ''[[Show of Hands (1987 album)|Show of Hands]]'' (1987) and ''[[Tall Ships (album)|Tall Ships]]'' (1990). The newly prioritised Show of Hands recorded ''[[Out for the Count]]'' at The Old Court in 1991, and released it on cassette that year, sold at the band's live performances.<ref>''Backlog 1987\u20131991'' liner notes</ref> The duo briefly entered a hiatus as Show of Hands to allow to form the Anglo-Chilean band [[Alianza (Anglo-Chilean band)|Alianza]] with [[Dave Townsend]] with three Chilean musicians, exploring [[world music]]. They released a [[Alianza (album)|self-titled album]] in 1992, becoming Knightley and Beer's first CD release. During the Alianza project, the duo recorded a performance from 8 June 1992 at [[Bridport]]'s Bull Hotel, working with engineer Mike Trim and released it on The Road Goes on Forever in 1992 as ''[[Show of Hands Live]]'', the duo's first CD, but by the time of its release, the band's previous three albums were out of print.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Roots: The Best of Show of Hands'' liner notes</ref>\n\nThe duo recorded their first, and only, studio album for TWAH! Records, ''[[Beat about the Bush]]'', in January 1994, and it was released the following month. Produced by Trim, due to his successful work on ''Show of Hands Live'', he and the duo aimed for an \"elusive \"radio friendly\" folk/roots album that retained the band's live sound whilst adding a [[rhythm section]].<ref>''[[Roots: The Best of Show of Hands]]'' liner notes.</ref> Whilst the album did not attract much radio attention as the duo had wanted,<ref name=autogenerated5>''[[Roots: The Best of Show of Hands]]'' liner notes</ref> it helped make the duo more popular and built upon their fan base. The duo left TWAH!

On this album, the duo tried to capture their live sound by recording all the instruments using a [[DI unit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomrobinson.com/writing/soh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321024206/http://www.tomrobinson.com/writing/soh.htm |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}</ref> The band had originally hired O'Farrell, an engineer/producer, for their live shows, following the release of ''Beat About the Bush''.

Like, 'sorry everyone - that may be what you heard live but now it's going to sound like a PROPER acoustic guitar.' Gerard [O'Farrell] was saying from his point of view the D.I. is what makes us sound different and it can kick in effects at a massive rate. The thump you get from the pickup is what turns the music into [[acoustic rock]].\"<ref name=autogenerated4 /> He also later summed up the recording by noting \"overdubs were minimal\" and that the duo \"made maximum use of [their] instrument [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]]s and [[pre-amp]]s.\"<ref>''Roots: The Best of Show of Hands''</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe album was released in October 1995 on the [[independent record label]] Isis Records.

Their debut album, ''[[Beat about the Bush]]'', was originally released on TWAH! Records before it was re-released on Hands on Music in 1999.

King|Jeff King]]<ref name=\"Writer and Director\" /><ref name=\"Mania\" /> and directed by [[Jon Cassar]].<ref name=\"Writer and Director\" /><ref name=\"Mania\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with Kiera ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]) being scanned into and debriefed on her first day of work at CPS. The scene then jumps to the present where Travis Verta ([[Roger Cross]]) and Liber8 who are getting ready to travel back to their original intended destination of 2077, although Matthew Kellog ([[Stephen Lobo]]) decides to remain behind and use his knowledge of the future to try and convince people of the Government's corruption, however the other members of the group do not agree and bid farewell to their comrade.\n\nKiera arrives at the precinct, slightly nervous and also begins to reassure herself, although she has a tense meeting with Betty Robertson ([[Jennifer Spence]]). Carlos ([[Victor Webster]]) is called into Dillon's ([[Brian Markinson]]) office to meet Sgt. Dan Barlow (Rocky Anderson) of Portland P.D. who blows Kiera's cover stating that he does not know her and that she is not who she says she is. Dillon arrests her and she is questioned in the interrogation room by Carlos. After asking if she was under arrest, Carlos informs her that she needs to be processed, causing Alec ([[Erik Knudsen]]) to explain that it means that they will run her prints and discover that she is not who she is claiming to be.\n\nKiera informs Alec through a chatpad on the leg of her suit that she needs him to create a false ID that will fool Carlos and Dillon. Outside Dillon questions whether there is a conflict of interest regarding Kiera with Carlos, to which Carlos denys. Dillon then tasks Carlos with having Kiera processed.\n\nElsewhere, the members of Liber8 pull up outside a parking garage and attack the security guard before Lucas Ingram ([[Omari Newton]]) pulls out a sphere shaped device that releases an electronic pulse, disabling much of the city's electrical power, including the elevator that Kiera and Carlos are currently in. After Alec informs her of where Liber8 are, she apologizes to Carlos and tases him before leaving the elevator to go after Liber8\n\nUsing a frequency generator built into her suit, she unlocks a series of cars before being told by Alec to get into one of the cars that required no key to start. While at first she has trouble starting and driving the vehicle, she eventually figures it out and heads for the scene of Liber8's crime. Meanwhile Alec rushes into his house to grab breakfast and Dillon discovers Carlos handcuffed in the elevator. Soon after, Kiera arrives at the parking garage and asks the coroner what happened, to which he explains that they went in and then came out.\n\nNearby officers take an interest in Kiera and Alec explains to her that there is a warrant out for her arrest. Alec shows here a picture of Dr. Simon Fraser (John Innes) and Kiera connects his work with rockets to the possibility of Time Travel. This leads to her attempting to get to him before Liber8, however Travis has already reached him and kidnapped him. Meanwhile, back at the station, Dillon says that Carlos needs to find Kiera as he vouched for her. Betty then comes over and reveals that a hacker hacked into the Portland P.D. database. Carlos and Betty both agree to catch the hacker and Kiera.\n\nKiera arrives at Frasier's house to which his wife opens the door. Kiera convinces Mrs. Frasier to tell her where her husband had been taken, who reluctantly tells her that he was taken back to the University that he works at. Kiera calls up Carlos and says that she will text him with the location of the gang and also reveals that she has been working undercover in the gang. Elsewhere, Kellog is stood outside of his old house, when a girl walks out. He says that his mum used to live there, while the girl replies that they live there now.\n\nKiera arrives at the University while Lucas places the Time Travel Device into the fusion generator, while Frasier warns him to be careful. He is hit in the head by Jasmine Garza ([[Luvia Petersen]]) who states that Lucas is a scientist. Travis asks if Lucas is done with the Doctor while Kiera arrives at the facility. She places her phone on a container and tries to contact Alec who is in the process of returning to his barn, where he sees the phone through hacked CTV and learns that she did not text Carlos the location.\n\nKiera explains that she did not inform Carlos because she wants to go home, causing Alec to feel slightly hurt that his new friend is leaving. She sneaks up on Liber8 using her invisibility and takes Sonya ([[Lexa Doig]]) at gunpoint. She orders Travis to let Frasier go and that all she wants to do it go back with them. Liber8 agree to her terms and Lucas places the device into the generator. The resulting explosion fails to fulfill their objective and instead they are simply blasted away rather than being sent back to 2077.\n\nKiera stands and tells the terrorists that the ceasefire is over and begins trying to kill them again. Meanwhile Carlos and his team enter the building although Liber8 see them and escape. Lucas later informs Travis that they are missing a piece of the Time Travel device. Carlos takes Kiera into custody and Frasier says that she shouldn't be arrested as she is a hero and saved him. Carlos pushes for more information on what happened inside but Fraiser refuses to divulge any more information.\n\nKiera gets processed while Betty attempts to find the hacker and Alec attempts to create Kiera a new identity. In a flashback we see Kiera tucking her son (Sean Michael Kyer) in and promising to tuck him in the next night afterwards her husband, Greg ([[John Reardon]]) tells her that she shouldn't make promises she may not be able to keep. In the present day Kiera begins to cry at the memory. Soon, however, Dillon comes in and refers to her and Agent Cameron, which is revealed to be the new identity created for her by Alec and it places her as being part of the FBI. After thanking Alec through Dillon, Dillon asks if she wants to join his task force directed at taking Liber8 down.\n\nCarlos gives her the tour where she sees the final piece of the Time Travel Device is being logged into evidence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Main===\n<!--Source = Openning Credits-->\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Kiera Cameron\n* [[Victor Webster]] as Carlos Fonnegra\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as Alec Sadler\n* [[Stephen Lobo]] as Matthew Kellog\n* [[Roger Cross]] as Travis Verta\n* [[Lexa Doig]] as Sonya Valentine\n* [[Tony Amendola]] as Edouard Kagame\n* [[Omari Newton]] as Lucas Ingram\n* [[Luvia Petersen]] as Jasmine Garza\n* [[Jennifer Spence]] as Betty Robertson\n* [[Terry Chen]] as Curtis Chen\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Jack Dillon\n{{Col-2}}\n\n===Guest===\n* [[John Reardon]] as Greg Cameron\n* Sean Michael Kyer as Sam Cameron\n* [[Michael Rogers (actor)|Michael Rogers]] as Roland Randol\n* [[Janet Kidder]] as Ann Sadler\n* [[Richard Harmon]] as Julian Randol\n* John Innes as Dr. Simon Fraser\n* Rocky Anderson as Sgt.

On the more positive side she explained that Kiera's relationships with both Alec and Carlos were building well and called the scenes of Kiera with her son in the future \"sweet\" as well as noting the fact that the episode does not over do Kiera's grief over being separated from her son. The final thing she commented on was the plot twist where Matthew Kellog decided to leave Liber8 and began using his knowledge of the future to begin creating himself a fortune.<ref name=\"Writer and Director\" />\n\nRob Kemp of Denofgeek UK gave a positive to mixed review of the episode stating that the showrunner had done a good job with making Liber8 appear as a real threat, noting specifically that \"People die in Continuum\" and \"actions have real consequence\", although he did condemn the fact that the future still has not been portrayed as terribly bad so Liber8's actions are stripped of all moral ambiguity and instead are portrayed more as selfish acts. He also noted that the writers appear to be concentrating on propelling the main story forwards and thus the small details are being sacrificed.<ref name=\"Denofgeek UK\" />\n\nJen Johnson of the US Denofgeek gives a positive review, mainly noting Alec and Kiera's relationship.<ref name=\"Denofgeek US\" />\n\nChuck Franciso of Mania gave a mostly negative review of the episode, noting that of the two storylines in the episode, one is followed not enough while the other is followed tomorrow. He also states that the illusion in the moment that the main character may not make it out of a particular situation is not presented at all in within the show.

The episode originally aired on June 3, 2012,<ref name=\"Air Date and Cast\" /> on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]]. The episode was written by [[Jeff F. King|Jeff King]]<ref name=\"Writer and Director\" /><ref name=\"Mania\" /> and directed by [[Jon Cassar]].<ref name=\"Writer and Director\" /><ref name=\"Mania\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with Kiera ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]) being scanned into and debriefed on her first day of work at CPS. The scene then jumps to the present where Travis Verta ([[Roger Cross]]) and Liber8 who are getting ready to travel back to their original intended destination of 2077, although Matthew Kellog ([[Stephen Lobo]]) decides to remain behind and use his knowledge of the future to try and convince people of the Government's corruption, however the other members of the group do not agree and bid farewell to their comrade.\n\nKiera arrives at the precinct, slightly nervous and also begins to reassure herself, although she has a tense meeting with Betty Robertson ([[Jennifer Spence]]). Carlos ([[Victor Webster]]) is called into Dillon's ([[Brian Markinson]]) office to meet Sgt. Dan Barlow (Rocky Anderson) of Portland P.D. who blows Kiera's cover stating that he does not know her and that she is not who she says she is. Dillon arrests her and she is questioned in the interrogation room by Carlos. After asking if she was under arrest, Carlos informs her that she needs to be processed, causing Alec ([[Erik Knudsen]]) to explain that it means that they will run her prints and discover that she is not who she is claiming to be.\n\nKiera informs Alec through a chatpad on the leg of her suit that she needs him to create a false ID that will fool Carlos and Dillon. Outside Dillon questions whether there is a conflict of interest regarding Kiera with Carlos, to which Carlos denys. Dillon then tasks Carlos with having Kiera processed.\n\nElsewhere, the members of Liber8 pull up outside a parking garage and attack the security guard before Lucas Ingram ([[Omari Newton]]) pulls out a sphere shaped device that releases an electronic pulse, disabling much of the city's electrical power, including the elevator that Kiera and Carlos are currently in. After Alec informs her of where Liber8 are, she apologizes to Carlos and tases him before leaving the elevator to go after Liber8\n\nUsing a frequency generator built into her suit, she unlocks a series of cars before being told by Alec to get into one of the cars that required no key to start. While at first she has trouble starting and driving the vehicle, she eventually figures it out and heads for the scene of Liber8's crime. Meanwhile Alec rushes into his house to grab breakfast and Dillon discovers Carlos handcuffed in the elevator. Soon after, Kiera arrives at the parking garage and asks the coroner what happened, to which he explains that they went in and then came out.\n\nNearby officers take an interest in Kiera and Alec explains to her that there is a warrant out for her arrest. Alec shows here a picture of Dr. Simon Fraser (John Innes) and Kiera connects his work with rockets to the possibility of Time Travel. This leads to her attempting to get to him before Liber8, however Travis has already reached him and kidnapped him. Meanwhile, back at the station, Dillon says that Carlos needs to find Kiera as he vouched for her. Betty then comes over and reveals that a hacker hacked into the Portland P.D. database. Carlos and Betty both agree to catch the hacker and Kiera.\n\nKiera arrives at Frasier's house to which his wife opens the door. Kiera convinces Mrs. Frasier to tell her where her husband had been taken, who reluctantly tells her that he was taken back to the University that he works at. Kiera calls up Carlos and says that she will text him with the location of the gang and also reveals that she has been working undercover in the gang. Elsewhere, Kellog is stood outside of his old house, when a girl walks out. He says that his mum used to live there, while the girl replies that they live there now.\n\nKiera arrives at the University while Lucas places the Time Travel Device into the fusion generator, while Frasier warns him to be careful. He is hit in the head by Jasmine Garza ([[Luvia Petersen]]) who states that Lucas is a scientist. Travis asks if Lucas is done with the Doctor while Kiera arrives at the facility. She places her phone on a container and tries to contact Alec who is in the process of returning to his barn, where he sees the phone through hacked CTV and learns that she did not text Carlos the location.\n\nKiera explains that she did not inform Carlos because she wants to go home, causing Alec to feel slightly hurt that his new friend is leaving. She sneaks up on Liber8 using her invisibility and takes Sonya ([[Lexa Doig]]) at gunpoint. She orders Travis to let Frasier go and that all she wants to do it go back with them. Liber8 agree to her terms and Lucas places the device into the generator. The resulting explosion fails to fulfill their objective and instead they are simply blasted away rather than being sent back to 2077.\n\nKiera stands and tells the terrorists that the ceasefire is over and begins trying to kill them again. Meanwhile Carlos and his team enter the building although Liber8 see them and escape. Lucas later informs Travis that they are missing a piece of the Time Travel device. Carlos takes Kiera into custody and Frasier says that she shouldn't be arrested as she is a hero and saved him. Carlos pushes for more information on what happened inside but Fraiser refuses to divulge any more information.\n\nKiera gets processed while Betty attempts to find the hacker and Alec attempts to create Kiera a new identity. In a flashback we see Kiera tucking her son (Sean Michael Kyer) in and promising to tuck him in the next night afterwards her husband, Greg ([[John Reardon]]) tells her that she shouldn't make promises she may not be able to keep. In the present day Kiera begins to cry at the memory. Soon, however, Dillon comes in and refers to her and Agent Cameron, which is revealed to be the new identity created for her by Alec and it places her as being part of the FBI. After thanking Alec through Dillon, Dillon asks if she wants to join his task force directed at taking Liber8 down.\n\nCarlos gives her the tour where she sees the final piece of the Time Travel Device is being logged into evidence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Main===\n<!--Source = Openning Credits-->\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Kiera Cameron\n* [[Victor Webster]] as Carlos Fonnegra\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as Alec Sadler\n* [[Stephen Lobo]] as Matthew Kellog\n* [[Roger Cross]] as Travis Verta\n* [[Lexa Doig]] as Sonya Valentine\n* [[Tony Amendola]] as Edouard Kagame\n* [[Omari Newton]] as Lucas Ingram\n* [[Luvia Petersen]] as Jasmine Garza\n* [[Jennifer Spence]] as Betty Robertson\n* [[Terry Chen]] as Curtis Chen\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Jack Dillon\n{{Col-2}}\n\n===Guest===\n* [[John Reardon]] as Greg Cameron\n* Sean Michael Kyer as Sam Cameron\n* [[Michael Rogers (actor)|Michael Rogers]] as Roland Randol\n* [[Janet Kidder]] as Ann Sadler\n* [[Richard Harmon]] as Julian Randol\n* John Innes as Dr. Simon Fraser\n* Rocky Anderson as Sgt.

On the more positive side she explained that Kiera's relationships with both Alec and Carlos were building well and called the scenes of Kiera with her son in the future \"sweet\" as well as noting the fact that the episode does not over do Kiera's grief over being separated from her son. The final thing she commented on was the plot twist where Matthew Kellog decided to leave Liber8 and began using his knowledge of the future to begin creating himself a fortune.<ref name=\"Writer and Director\" />\n\nRob Kemp of Denofgeek UK gave a positive to mixed review of the episode stating that the showrunner had done a good job with making Liber8 appear as a real threat, noting specifically that \"People die in Continuum\" and \"actions have real consequence\", although he did condemn the fact that the future still has not been portrayed as terribly bad so Liber8's actions are stripped of all moral ambiguity and instead are portrayed more as selfish acts. He also noted that the writers appear to be concentrating on propelling the main story forwards and thus the small details are being sacrificed.<ref name=\"Denofgeek UK\" />\n\nJen Johnson of the US Denofgeek gives a positive review, mainly noting Alec and Kiera's relationship.<ref name=\"Denofgeek US\" />\n\nChuck Franciso of Mania gave a mostly negative review of the episode, noting that of the two storylines in the episode, one is followed not enough while the other is followed tomorrow. He also states that the illusion in the moment that the main character may not make it out of a particular situation is not presented at all in within the show. He was grateful however that a member of Liber8 was not foaming at the mouth for murder, although he also expressed worry that the other members seeming love for murder could lead to them killing one of their ancestors by mistake.<ref name=\"Mania\" />\n\nRandy Dankievitch of Proceeds Media gave the episode a grading of C+, stating that the episode, at times, \"gets lost up its own ass\", and noting that some small details such as Carlos not wondering how Kiera tased him, appear to go untouched.<ref name=\"Processed Media\" />\n\nTyler Olson of Crimson Tear gave a positive review of the episode, elaborating that the characters were taking on much larger roles and that the changes made worked well.

Leaving the car at the roadside, they decide instead to see the taping of a television show at the local studio. Bob runs across Chuck Charles, with whom he has a history (see \"[[Beefsquatch]]\"), and who is now the host of ''Family Fracas'', a game show styled after ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' that offers a new minivan as its grand prize. Over Chuck's objections, and spurred on by Linda and the kids, Bob agrees to let his family compete against the reigning champions.\n\nThe Belchers win game after game, to Chuck's dismay, but receive only a 5-gallon bucket of \"Fracas Foam\" (an orange slimy substance dumped onto the losing family) after each victory due to Louise's spinning of the prize wheel. Jimmy and his family challenge and defeat them, winning the minivan, and the Belchers return home. Watching a viral video of the final round, Bob becomes convinced that Chuck rigged it in Jimmy's favor and confronts Harry, the producer of ''Family Fracas''. Harry arranges for the Belchers to sue Jimmy and Chuck on ''Pam's Court'', a court show presided over by Chuck's bitter ex-wife Pam.\n\nBob has no direct evidence of any cheating until Gene realizes that an overhead camera in the ''Family Fracas'' studio may have recorded it. Pam orders Chuck to bring in the videotape from that camera, but he destroys it instead. Without any evidence to support Bob's claims, Pam is forced to rule in favor of Jimmy and Chuck. As the Belchers walk home from the studio, they find Jimmy trying in vain to change a flat tire on his new minivan. Bob decides to help, even though Jimmy continues to mock him and to Bob's dismay, the rest of his family joins in.\n\n==Reception==\nRowan Kaiser of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B\u2013, saying \"The inability for the Belchers to make progress renders \u201cFamily Fracas\u201d relatively disappointing overall. Although it certainly has its funny moments, they don't coalesce into a full episode because the failures become so predictable.

Leaving the car at the roadside, they decide instead to see the taping of a television show at the local studio. Bob runs across Chuck Charles, with whom he has a history (see \"[[Beefsquatch]]\"), and who is now the host of ''Family Fracas'', a game show styled after ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' that offers a new minivan as its grand prize. Over Chuck's objections, and spurred on by Linda and the kids, Bob agrees to let his family compete against the reigning champions.\n\nThe Belchers win game after game, to Chuck's dismay, but receive only a 5-gallon bucket of \"Fracas Foam\" (an orange slimy substance dumped onto the losing family) after each victory due to Louise's spinning of the prize wheel. Jimmy and his family challenge and defeat them, winning the minivan, and the Belchers return home. Watching a viral video of the final round, Bob becomes convinced that Chuck rigged it in Jimmy's favor and confronts Harry, the producer of ''Family Fracas''. Harry arranges for the Belchers to sue Jimmy and Chuck on ''Pam's Court'', a court show presided over by Chuck's bitter ex-wife Pam.\n\nBob has no direct evidence of any cheating until Gene realizes that an overhead camera in the ''Family Fracas'' studio may have recorded it. Pam orders Chuck to bring in the videotape from that camera, but he destroys it instead. Without any evidence to support Bob's claims, Pam is forced to rule in favor of Jimmy and Chuck. As the Belchers walk home from the studio, they find Jimmy trying in vain to change a flat tire on his new minivan. Bob decides to help, even though Jimmy continues to mock him and to Bob's dismay, the rest of his family joins in.\n\n==Reception==\nRowan Kaiser of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B\u2013, saying \"The inability for the Belchers to make progress renders \u201cFamily Fracas\u201d relatively disappointing overall. Although it certainly has its funny moments, they don't coalesce into a full episode because the failures become so predictable. The Belchers may deserve fame, and fame could even be good for them in their world, but it's best for us viewers in our world that they stay unrecognized in theirs.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaiser |first=Rowan |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/family-fracas,95976/ |title=\"Family Fracas\" &#124; Bob\u2019s Burgers &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.
