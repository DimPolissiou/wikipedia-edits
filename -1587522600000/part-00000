It was a twin [[turboprop]] configuration, and carried two crew members in side-by-side seating. The Mohawk was intended to operate from short, unimproved runways in support of [[United States Army]] maneuver forces.\n\n==Development==\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of OV-1 Mohawk-1960.ogv\n| title       = Overview of the OV-1 Mohawk (1960)\n}}\nThe Mohawk began as a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would outperform the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna L-19 Bird Dog]]. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the [[Korean War]]. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]], air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and radiological monitoring. The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small \"jeep\" [[Escort carrier|escort class carriers]] (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as the winner of the competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 knots. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the [[close air support]] (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.\n\nThe Air Force did not like the armament capability of the Mohawk and tried to get it removed. The Marines did not want the sophisticated sensors the Army wanted, so when their Navy sponsors opted to buy a fleet oil tanker, they dropped from the program. The Army continued with armed Mohawks and developed cargo pods that could be dropped from underwing hard points to resupply troops in emergencies.\n\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of SLAR on OV-1D Mohawk.ogv\n| title       = The OV-1 Mohawk's SLAR capabilities\n}}\nThe radar imaging capability of the Mohawk was to prove a significant advance in both peace and war. The [[Side looking airborne radar|Side-Looking Airborne Radar]] (SLAR) could look through foliage and map terrain, presenting the observer with a film image of the earth below only minutes after the area was scanned. In military operations, the image was split in two parts, one showing fixed terrain features, the other spotting moving targets.\n\nThe prototype (''YAO-1AF'') first flew on April 14, 1959. The OV-1 entered production in October 1959.\n\nIn mid-1961, the first Mohawks to serve with U.S. forces overseas were delivered to the [[United States Army Europe|7th Army]] at [[Coleman Army Airfield|Sandhofen Airfield]] near Mannheim, Germany. Before its formal acceptance, the camera-carrying AO-1AF was flown by Ralph Donnell on a tour of 29 European airfields to display it to the U.S. Army field commanders and potential European customers. In addition to their Vietnam and European service, SLAR-equipped Mohawks began operational missions in 1963 patrolling the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Germany and France showed early interest in the Mohawk, and Grumman actually signed a license production agreement with the French manufacturer [[Breguet Aviation]] in exchange for American rights to the [[Breguet Atlantic|Atlantic]] maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe very nature of the joint Army/Marine program had forced design compromises, such as [[ejection seat]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/ov1seats.htm |title = The Ejection Site: OV-1 Mohawk Ejection Seats}}</ref> that made the aircraft expensive and, sometimes, an openly resisted item in Army budgets. Orders for the OV-1 stopped in Fiscal 1964, and the controversy in the Pentagon over the armed Mohawk peaked with a 1965 directive that prohibited the Army from operating armed fixed-wing aircraft (See the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]]). Operational success in Vietnam led to additional Mohawk orders in 1966, and by 1968, five surveillance companies were operating in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe last of the Mohawk versions to enter production was the OV-1D with more powerful [[Lycoming T53|T53-701]] engines, improved avionics, and interchangeable mission pallets that made it possible to switch the aircraft from infrared to SLAR configuration in about an hour. The first four OV-1Ds were prototypes converted from earlier production airframes, and the first flew in 1969. These were followed by 37 new-build aircraft, the last of which was delivered in December 1970.\n\n[[File:OV-1 Mohawk proposed variants diagrams.png|thumb|Proposed variants of the OV-1]]\nOver the years, the mission and the aircraft underwent many changes and roughly 380 were built over all variants. Mohawk variants included the JOV-1 [armed reconnaissance], OV-1A, [visual and photographic], OV-1B [visual, photographic, and side-looking radar (SLAR) pod], the OV-1C [visual, photographic, and infrared], and the OV-1D (SLAR pod and bigger wings), OV-1E [enlarged fuselage for more sensor operators or cargo], EV-1E [special [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] installation] and RV-1E [advanced ELINT reconnaissance]. A four-engined Model 134E with [[tiltwing]]s and tail [[ducted fan]] for control for [[VTOL]] was proposed to the Army but not built. Model 134R was a tandem cockpit version offered to meet the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco#Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft|Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft]] (LARA) requirement, but the NA300 was chosen instead becoming the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10]].\n\n==Operational history==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== United States Army ===\nThe U.S. Army flew the OV-1 operationally in the [[Vietnam War]], with sixty-five lost to accidents, ground fire, and one shot down by a North Vietnamese fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-ov-1-mohawk-remembered-firsthand-piloting-the-mohawk-in-vietnam/|title=The OV-1 Mohawk Remembered Firsthand: Piloting the Mohawk in Vietnam|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The Army also used the aircraft during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]].\n\nStarting in 1972, the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) began to receive the Mohawk, with the ARNG eventually operating thirteen OV-1Bs, twenty-four OV-1Cs, and sixteen OV-1Ds serving with three aviation units in Georgia and Oregon.  The Oregon Army National Guard Unit operating the Mohawk was located at [[McNary Field]] in Oregon, initially as the 1042nd Military Intelligence Company (Aerial Surveillance), then reflagged as the 641st Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI)(Aerial Exploitation).\n\nU.S. Army OV-1s were retired from Europe in 1992, from Korea in September 1996, and finally in the United States in 1996, superseded by newer systems, newer aircraft, and the evolution of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. The OV-1 was primarily replaced by the EO-5C, a militarized version of the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] turboprop airliner equipped with a SLAR system, until the U.S. Air Force's [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS]] (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) aircraft became fully operational.\n\nAs of 2011, [[Alliant Techsystems]] partnered with the Broadbay Group and Mohawk Technologies of Florida in a venture to return an armed, modernized version of the OV-1D to operational use as a [[counter-insurgency aircraft]].  A demonstrator was equipped with a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] Star Safire turret and a ventral, trainable [[M230 chain gun]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Defense Technology International Magazine |date=April 2011 |volume=5 |issue=4) |page=40 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/DTI |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=1935-6269}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://defensetech.org/2010/10/28/old-school-coin-planes-keep-coming-back/ |first=John |last=Reed |title=Old School COIN Planes Keep Coming Back |work=Defensetech |date=2010-10-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Argentine Army ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Argentine Army Aviation]] received twenty-three OV-1 in the 1990s.

The Mohawk was intended to operate from short, unimproved runways in support of [[United States Army]] maneuver forces.\n\n==Development==\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of OV-1 Mohawk-1960.ogv\n| title       = Overview of the OV-1 Mohawk (1960)\n}}\nThe Mohawk began as a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would outperform the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna L-19 Bird Dog]]. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the [[Korean War]]. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]], air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and radiological monitoring. The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small \"jeep\" [[Escort carrier|escort class carriers]] (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as the winner of the competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 knots. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the [[close air support]] (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.\n\nThe Air Force did not like the armament capability of the Mohawk and tried to get it removed. The Marines did not want the sophisticated sensors the Army wanted, so when their Navy sponsors opted to buy a fleet oil tanker, they dropped from the program. The Army continued with armed Mohawks and developed cargo pods that could be dropped from underwing hard points to resupply troops in emergencies.\n\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of SLAR on OV-1D Mohawk.ogv\n| title       = The OV-1 Mohawk's SLAR capabilities\n}}\nThe radar imaging capability of the Mohawk was to prove a significant advance in both peace and war. The [[Side looking airborne radar|Side-Looking Airborne Radar]] (SLAR) could look through foliage and map terrain, presenting the observer with a film image of the earth below only minutes after the area was scanned. In military operations, the image was split in two parts, one showing fixed terrain features, the other spotting moving targets.\n\nThe prototype (''YAO-1AF'') first flew on April 14, 1959. The OV-1 entered production in October 1959.\n\nIn mid-1961, the first Mohawks to serve with U.S. forces overseas were delivered to the [[United States Army Europe|7th Army]] at [[Coleman Army Airfield|Sandhofen Airfield]] near Mannheim, Germany. Before its formal acceptance, the camera-carrying AO-1AF was flown by Ralph Donnell on a tour of 29 European airfields to display it to the U.S. Army field commanders and potential European customers. In addition to their Vietnam and European service, SLAR-equipped Mohawks began operational missions in 1963 patrolling the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Germany and France showed early interest in the Mohawk, and Grumman actually signed a license production agreement with the French manufacturer [[Breguet Aviation]] in exchange for American rights to the [[Breguet Atlantic|Atlantic]] maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe very nature of the joint Army/Marine program had forced design compromises, such as [[ejection seat]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/ov1seats.htm |title = The Ejection Site: OV-1 Mohawk Ejection Seats}}</ref> that made the aircraft expensive and, sometimes, an openly resisted item in Army budgets. Orders for the OV-1 stopped in Fiscal 1964, and the controversy in the Pentagon over the armed Mohawk peaked with a 1965 directive that prohibited the Army from operating armed fixed-wing aircraft (See the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]]). Operational success in Vietnam led to additional Mohawk orders in 1966, and by 1968, five surveillance companies were operating in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe last of the Mohawk versions to enter production was the OV-1D with more powerful [[Lycoming T53|T53-701]] engines, improved avionics, and interchangeable mission pallets that made it possible to switch the aircraft from infrared to SLAR configuration in about an hour. The first four OV-1Ds were prototypes converted from earlier production airframes, and the first flew in 1969. These were followed by 37 new-build aircraft, the last of which was delivered in December 1970.\n\n[[File:OV-1 Mohawk proposed variants diagrams.png|thumb|Proposed variants of the OV-1]]\nOver the years, the mission and the aircraft underwent many changes and roughly 380 were built over all variants. Mohawk variants included the JOV-1 [armed reconnaissance], OV-1A, [visual and photographic], OV-1B [visual, photographic, and side-looking radar (SLAR) pod], the OV-1C [visual, photographic, and infrared], and the OV-1D (SLAR pod and bigger wings), OV-1E [enlarged fuselage for more sensor operators or cargo], EV-1E [special [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] installation] and RV-1E [advanced ELINT reconnaissance]. A four-engined Model 134E with [[tiltwing]]s and tail [[ducted fan]] for control for [[VTOL]] was proposed to the Army but not built. Model 134R was a tandem cockpit version offered to meet the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco#Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft|Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft]] (LARA) requirement, but the NA300 was chosen instead becoming the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10]].\n\n==Operational history==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== United States Army ===\nThe U.S. Army flew the OV-1 operationally in the [[Vietnam War]], with sixty-five lost to accidents, ground fire, and one shot down by a North Vietnamese fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-ov-1-mohawk-remembered-firsthand-piloting-the-mohawk-in-vietnam/|title=The OV-1 Mohawk Remembered Firsthand: Piloting the Mohawk in Vietnam|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The Army also used the aircraft during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]].\n\nStarting in 1972, the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) began to receive the Mohawk, with the ARNG eventually operating thirteen OV-1Bs, twenty-four OV-1Cs, and sixteen OV-1Ds serving with three aviation units in Georgia and Oregon.  The Oregon Army National Guard Unit operating the Mohawk was located at [[McNary Field]] in Oregon, initially as the 1042nd Military Intelligence Company (Aerial Surveillance), then reflagged as the 641st Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI)(Aerial Exploitation).\n\nU.S. Army OV-1s were retired from Europe in 1992, from Korea in September 1996, and finally in the United States in 1996, superseded by newer systems, newer aircraft, and the evolution of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. The OV-1 was primarily replaced by the EO-5C, a militarized version of the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] turboprop airliner equipped with a SLAR system, until the U.S. Air Force's [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS]] (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) aircraft became fully operational.\n\nAs of 2011, [[Alliant Techsystems]] partnered with the Broadbay Group and Mohawk Technologies of Florida in a venture to return an armed, modernized version of the OV-1D to operational use as a [[counter-insurgency aircraft]].  A demonstrator was equipped with a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] Star Safire turret and a ventral, trainable [[M230 chain gun]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Defense Technology International Magazine |date=April 2011 |volume=5 |issue=4) |page=40 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/DTI |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=1935-6269}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://defensetech.org/2010/10/28/old-school-coin-planes-keep-coming-back/ |first=John |last=Reed |title=Old School COIN Planes Keep Coming Back |work=Defensetech |date=2010-10-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Argentine Army ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Argentine Army Aviation]] received twenty-three OV-1 in the 1990s.

The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot was killed. Its serial number was 68-15958.\n\nIn early 1968, U.S. Army Captain Ken Lee shot down a MiG-17 \u201cFresco\u201d fighter jet utilizing his OV-1's XM14 .50 caliber gun pods as well as two M159 unguided rocket pods, becoming the only Army Aviator to ever down a MiG.  Due to the Key West Agreement, the Army wanted to keep the shootdown a secret in fears that it would allow the USAF to yank its Mohawks from the inventory.  Lee's kill was finally formally recognized by the Army in 2007.  The Mohawk would serve until 1996, when it was formally retired from the US Army\u2019s inventory.<ref>https://warisboring.com/the-armys-only-air-to-air-kill-since-wwii-was-done-with-a-50-cal-in-vietnam/</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:OV-1 mohawk variants diagrams.png|thumb|350px|OV-1 Mohawk variants]]\n{{Multiple image\n| width1  = 200\n| image1  = OV-1_Mohawk.jpg\n| caption1= OV-1A Mohawk\n| width2  = 225\n| image2  = Grumman OV-1D Mohawk (G-134), USA - Army AN1188459.jpg\n| caption2= OV-1D Mohawk SLAR variant\n}}\n;YAO-1 (YOV-1A) : Initial prototypes (9 built).\n;OV-1A (AO-1AF) : Daylight observation variant (64 built).\n;OV-1B (AO-1BF) : SLAR variant (101 built).\n;OV-1C (AO-1CF) : IR reconnaissance variant (169 built).\n;OV-1D : Consolidated sensor variant (37 new, 82 conversions).\n;JOV-1A : OV-1As and OV-1Cs fitted with armament (59 conversions).\n;RV-1C : Quick Look ELINT machines (two conversions).\n;RV-1D : Quick Look II ELINT machine (31 conversions).\n;EV-1E : Quick Look III ELINT machine (16 conversions).\n;OV-1E : Prototype for unproduced modernized variant (1 built).\n\n==Former operators==\n;{{ARG}}\n* [[Argentine Army]]\n** [[Argentine Army Aviation]]\n;{{ISR}}\n* [[Israeli Air Force]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iaf.org.il/197-18254-en/IAF.aspx?indx=1|title=Grumman OV-1 Mohawk (Hebrew nickname: 'Atalef' ('Bat'))|publisher=Israeli Air Force|accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n;{{USA}}\n* [[United States Army]]\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n<!-- please help us compete this list -->\n[[File:EvergreenOV-1D.jpg|right|thumb|OV-1D Mohawk at the [[Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum]] in [[McMinnville, Oregon]]]]\n[[File:Cavanaugh Flight Museum-2008-10-29-043 (4270575312).jpg|thumb|OV-1D Mohawk at the [[Cavanaugh Flight Museum]]]]\n\n===Airworthy===\n*59-2604 \u2013 OV-1A flown by the [[Planes of Fame Air Museum]] in [[Chino, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://planesoffame.org/index.php?mact=staircraft,cntnt01,default,0&cntnt01what=stplanes&cntnt01alias=OV-1A&cntnt01returnid=128|title=Grumman OV-1A|publisher=Planes of Fame Air Museum|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref>\n*59-2631 \u2013 [[United States Military Air Power Museum]] in Jacksonville, FL has the only restored and flying OV-1B <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usmapmuseum.org/OV-1B%20631.htm |title=OV-1B Mohawk \u2013 High Performance Reconnaissance / Attack Airplane |publisher=Joshua G.

Codenamed '''Operation Neptune''' and often referred to as '''D-Day''', it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the [[Free France#Liberation of France|liberation]] of [[Occupied France|German-occupied France]] (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\nPlanning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] conducted a substantial [[military deception]], codenamed [[Operation Bodyguard]], to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. [[Adolf Hitler]] placed [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an Allied invasion.\n\nThe [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landings]] were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an [[airborne forces|airborne assault]]\u2014the [[American airborne landings in Normandy|landing of 24,000 American]], [[Operation Tonga|British, and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight]]. Allied [[infantry]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]] [[division (military)|divisions]] began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target {{Convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the [[Normandy]] coast was divided into five sectors: [[Utah Beach|Utah]], [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], [[Gold Beach|Gold]], [[Juno Beach|Juno]], and [[Sword Beach|Sword]]. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was [[land mine|mined]] and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, [[Czech hedgehog|metal tripods]], and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using specialised tanks.\n\nThe Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. [[Carentan]], [[St. L\u00f4]], and [[Bayeux]] remained in German hands, and [[Caen]], a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five [[beachhead]]s were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold that the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were documented for at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. Museums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors each year.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] began pressing his new allies for the creation of a [[Western Front (World War II)#1944\u201345: The Second Front|second front]] in western Europe.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=8\u20139}} In late May 1942 the [[Soviet Union in World War II|Soviet Union]] and the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States]] made a joint announcement that a \"... full understanding was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.\"{{sfn|Folliard|1942}} However, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] persuaded US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to postpone the promised invasion as, even with US help, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] did not have adequate forces for such an activity.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=10}}\n\nInstead of an immediate return to France, the western Allies staged offensives in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]], where [[British Army|British troops]] were already stationed. By mid-1943 the [[Tunisia Campaign|campaign in North Africa]] had been won. The Allies then launched the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, and subsequently [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]] in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion within the next year was taken at the [[Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=10\u201311}} Initial planning was constrained by the number of available [[landing craft]], most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and [[Pacific War|Pacific]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=177\u2013178, chart p. 180}} At the [[Tehran Conference]] in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=404}}\n\n[[File:Meeting of the Supreme Command, Allied Expeditionary Force, London, 1 February 1944 TR1631.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Meeting of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), 1 February 1944.

Back row: [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]]; [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]]; Air Chief Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]]; Lieutenant General [[Walter Bedell Smith]].]]\n\nThe Allies considered four sites for the landings: [[Brittany]], the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], [[Normandy]], and the [[Pas-de-Calais]]. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, it would have been possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=13\u201314}} With the Pas-de-Calais being the closest point in [[continental Europe]] to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=33\u201334}} But it offered few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals,{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site.{{sfn|Ambrose|1994|pp=73\u201374}} The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast\u2014the lack of port facilities\u2014would be overcome through the development of artificial [[Mulberry harbour]]s.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} A series of modified tanks, nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]], dealt with specific requirements expected for the Normandy Campaign such as mine clearing, demolishing bunkers, and mobile bridging.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=182}}\n\nThe Allies planned to launch the invasion on 1 May 1944.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF).{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all land forces involved in the invasion.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12\u201313}} On 31 December 1943 Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three [[Division (military)|divisions]] with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to speed the capture of Cherbourg.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two US, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=684}} all under overall British command.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=521\u2013533}}\n\n==Operations==\n[[Operation Overlord]] was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale [[lodgement]] on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed [[Operation Pointblank]]) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} Elaborate deceptions, codenamed [[Operation Bodyguard]], were undertaken in the months leading up to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe landings were to be preceded by airborne operations near [[Caen]] on the eastern flank to secure the [[Orne (river)|Orne River]] bridges and north of [[Carentan]] on the western flank. The Americans, assigned to land at [[Utah Beach]] and [[Omaha Beach]], were to attempt to capture Carentan and [[St. L\u00f4]] the first day, then cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and eventually capture the port facilities at [[Cherbourg]]. The British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and [[Gold Beach]]es and Canadians at [[Juno Beach]] would protect the US flank and attempt to establish airfields near Caen on the first day.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592\u2013593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}} (A sixth beach, code-named \"Band\", was considered to the east of the Orne.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2019|p=136}}) A secure lodgement would be established with all invading forces linked together, and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the [[Avranches]]-[[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] line within the first three weeks.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592\u2013593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}} Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, lasting until all Allied forces reached the River [[Seine]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=698}}\n\n==Deception plans==\n[[File:Ghost Army.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder patches were designed for units of the fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] under [[George Patton]]. ]]\nUnder the overall umbrella of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the Allied landings.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=680}} [[Operation Fortitude]] included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway,{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=465}} and Fortitude South, a major deception involving the creation of a fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] under Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], supposedly located in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]]. Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=71\u201372}} Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}} Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=282}}\n\nMany of the German radar stations on the French coast were destroyed in preparation for the landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} In addition, on the night before the invasion, a small group of [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) operators deployed dummy paratroopers over [[Le Havre]] and [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. These dummies led the Germans to believe that an additional airborne landing had occurred. On that same night, in [[Operation Taxable]], [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] dropped strips of \"window\", [[Chaff (countermeasure)|metal foil]] that caused a radar return which was mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy near Le Havre. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing [[barrage balloon]]s. A similar deception was undertaken near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in the Pas de Calais area by [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]] in [[Operation Glimmer]].{{sfn|Bickers|1994|pp=19\u201321}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=76}}\n\n==Weather==\nThe invasion planners determined a set of conditions involving the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that would be satisfactory on only a few days in each month. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the [[Tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|highest tides]]. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles on the beach, while minimising the amount of time the men would be exposed in the open.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were unsuitable for a landing: high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=33}}\n\n[[File:Ddayweather.jpg|thumb|[[Surface weather analysis]] map showing [[weather front]]s on 5 June]]\n\nGroup Captain [[James Stagg]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) met Eisenhower on the evening of 4 June.

Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=224}} After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on the 6th.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=224\u2013226}} A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=33}}\n\nAllied control of the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less information than the Allies on incoming weather patterns.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} As the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend [[Military simulation|war games]] in [[Rennes]], and men in many units were given leave.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=131}} Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more [[Panzer]]s.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=42\u201343}}\n\n==German order of battle==\nNazi Germany had at its disposal fifty [[Division (military)|divisions]] in France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=144}} Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were ''[[Ostlegionen]]'' (eastern legions)\u2014conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union.

He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed as close to the coast as possible. Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected. They believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. He also noted that in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way. Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three [[Panzer division]]s under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves.

The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored by members of the [[Royal Engineers]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=312\u2013313}} The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=275}}\n\nMajor German strongpoints with 75&nbsp;mm guns, machine-gun nests, concrete fortifications, barbed wire, and mines were located at [[Courseulles-sur-Mer]], [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|St Aubin-sur-Mer]], and [[Berni\u00e8res-sur-Mer]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|loc=Map, pp. 314\u2013315}} The towns themselves also had to be cleared in house-to-house fighting.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=317}} Soldiers on their way to [[B\u00e9ny-sur-Mer]], {{convert|3|mi|sigfig=1}} inland, discovered that the road was well covered by machine gun emplacements that had to be outflanked before the advance could proceed.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=133\u2013135}} Elements of the [[9th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] advanced to within sight of the [[Caen \u2013 Carpiquet Airport|Carpiquet airfield]] late in the afternoon, but by this time their supporting armour was low on ammunition so the Canadians dug in for the night. The airfield was not captured until a month later as the area became the scene of fierce fighting.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=135}} By nightfall, the contiguous Juno and Gold beachheads covered an area {{convert|12|mi}} wide and {{convert|7|mi|sigfig=1}} deep.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=276}} Casualties at Juno were 961 men.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=131}}\n\n===Sword Beach===\n{{Main|Sword Beach}}\n[[File:Infantry waiting to move off 'Queen White' Beach.jpg|thumb|British troops take cover after landing on [[Sword Beach]]. ]]\n\nOn Sword, 21 of 25 DD tanks of the first wave were successful in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=277}} The beach was heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making the work of the beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=239\u2013240}} In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult. The beach quickly became congested.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=143}} Brigadier [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat]] and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, [[bagpipes|piped ashore]] by Private [[Bill Millin]], Lovat's personal piper.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=138}} Members of [[No. 4 Commando]] moved through [[Ouistreham]] to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=244\u2013245}} French forces under Commander [[Philippe Kieffer]] (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\nThe 'Morris' strongpoint near [[Colleville-sur-Mer]] was captured after about an hour of fighting.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=143}} The nearby 'Hillman' strongpoint, headquarters of the 736th Infantry Regiment, was a large complex defensive work that had come through the morning's bombardment essentially undamaged. It was not captured until 20:15.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=248\u2013249}} The 2nd Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] began advancing to Caen on foot, coming within a few kilometres of the town, but had to withdraw due to lack of armour support.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=143, 148}} At 16:00, the 21st Panzer Division mounted a counter-attack between Sword and Juno and nearly succeeded in reaching the Channel. It met stiff resistance from the British 3rd Division and was soon recalled to assist in the area between Caen and Bayeux.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=326\u2013327}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=283}} Estimates of Allied casualties on Sword Beach are as high as 1,000.{{sfn|Portsmouth Museum Services}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:D-Day5.jpg|thumb|Situation map for 24:00, 6 June 1944]]\nThe Normandy landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and assault craft, 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=74}} Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day,{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=521\u2013533}} with 875,000 men disembarking by the end of June.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=104}} Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=87}} The Germans lost 1,000 men.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=335}} The Allied invasion plans had called for the capture of Carentan, St. L\u00f4, Caen, and Bayeux on the first day, with all the beaches (other than Utah) linked with a front line {{convert|10|to|16|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from the beaches; none of these objectives were achieved.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}} The five beachheads were not connected until 12 June, by which time the Allies held a front around {{convert|97|km}} long and {{convert|24|km}} deep.{{sfn|Horn|2010|p=13}} Caen, a major objective, was still in German hands at the end of D-Day and would not be completely captured until 21 July.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=360}} The Germans had ordered French civilians other than those deemed essential to the war effort to leave potential combat zones in Normandy.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=102}} Civilian casualties on D-Day and D+1 are estimated at 3,000.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=336}}\n\nThe Allied victory in Normandy stemmed from several factors. German preparations along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete in some areas as resources were diverted elsewhere.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=290}} The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=343}} The Allies achieved and maintained [[air supremacy]], which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=289}} Infrastructure for transport in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, making it difficult for the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=36}} Some of the opening bombardment was off-target or not concentrated enough to have any impact,{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=91}} but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha, providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=291}} Indecisiveness and an overly complicated command structure on the part of the German high command were also factors in the Allied success.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=292}}\n\n==War memorials and tourism==\nAt Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain. A memorial to the US [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] sits at the location of a former German strongpoint. Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The [[Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial]] is nearby, in [[Colleville-sur-Mer]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=346}} A museum about the Utah landings is located at [[Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, Manche|Sainte-Marie-du-Mont]], and there is one dedicated to the activities of the US airmen at Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=346\u2013348}}\n\n[[Pegasus Bridge]], a target of the British 6th Airborne, was the site of some of the earliest action of the Normandy landings.

Codenamed '''Operation Neptune''' and often referred to as '''D-Day''', it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the [[Free France#Liberation of France|liberation]] of [[Occupied France|German-occupied France]] (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\nPlanning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] conducted a substantial [[military deception]], codenamed [[Operation Bodyguard]], to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. [[Adolf Hitler]] placed German [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an Allied invasion.\n\nThe [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landings]] were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an [[airborne forces|airborne assault]]\u2014the [[American airborne landings in Normandy|landing of 24,000 American]], [[Operation Tonga|British, and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight]]. Allied [[infantry]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]] [[division (military)|divisions]] began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target {{Convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the [[Normandy]] coast was divided into five sectors: [[Utah Beach|Utah]], [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], [[Gold Beach|Gold]], [[Juno Beach|Juno]], and [[Sword Beach|Sword]]. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was [[land mine|mined]] and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, [[Czech hedgehog|metal tripods]], and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using specialised tanks.\n\nThe Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. [[Carentan]], [[St. L\u00f4]], and [[Bayeux]] remained in German hands, and [[Caen]], a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five [[beachhead]]s were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold that the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were documented for at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead. Museums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors each year.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] began pressing his new allies for the creation of a [[Western Front (World War II)#1944\u201345: The Second Front|second front]] in western Europe.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=8\u20139}} In late May 1942 the [[Soviet Union in World War II|Soviet Union]] and the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States]] made a joint announcement that a \"... full understanding was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.\"{{sfn|Folliard|1942}} However, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] persuaded US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to postpone the promised invasion as, even with US help, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] did not have adequate forces for such an activity.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=10}}\n\nInstead of an immediate return to France, the western Allies staged offensives in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]], where [[British Army|British troops]] were already stationed. By mid-1943 the [[Tunisia Campaign|campaign in North Africa]] had been won. The Allies then launched the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, and subsequently [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]] in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion within the next year was taken at the [[Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=10\u201311}} Initial planning was constrained by the number of available [[landing craft]], most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and [[Pacific War|Pacific]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=177\u2013178, chart p. 180}} At the [[Tehran Conference]] in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=404}}\n\n[[File:Meeting of the Supreme Command, Allied Expeditionary Force, London, 1 February 1944 TR1631.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Meeting of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), 1 February 1944.

Back row: [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]]; [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]]; Air Chief Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]]; Lieutenant General [[Walter Bedell Smith]].]]\n\nThe Allies considered four sites for the landings: [[Brittany]], the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], [[Normandy]], and the [[Pas-de-Calais]]. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, it would have been possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=13\u201314}} With the Pas-de-Calais being the closest point in [[continental Europe]] to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=33\u201334}} But it offered few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals,{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site.{{sfn|Ambrose|1994|pp=73\u201374}} The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast\u2014the lack of port facilities\u2014would be overcome through the development of artificial [[Mulberry harbour]]s.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} A series of modified tanks, nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]], dealt with specific requirements expected for the Normandy Campaign such as mine clearing, demolishing bunkers, and mobile bridging.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=182}}\n\nThe Allies planned to launch the invasion on 1 May 1944.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF).{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all land forces involved in the invasion.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12\u201313}} On 31 December 1943 Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three [[Division (military)|divisions]] with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to speed the capture of Cherbourg.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two US, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=684}} all under overall British command.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=521\u2013533}}\n\n==Operations==\n[[Operation Overlord]] was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale [[lodgement]] on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed [[Operation Pointblank]]) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} Elaborate deceptions, codenamed [[Operation Bodyguard]], were undertaken in the months leading up to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe landings were to be preceded by airborne operations near [[Caen]] on the eastern flank to secure the [[Orne (river)|Orne River]] bridges and north of [[Carentan]] on the western flank. The Americans, assigned to land at [[Utah Beach]] and [[Omaha Beach]], were to attempt to capture Carentan and [[St. L\u00f4]] the first day, then cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and eventually capture the port facilities at [[Cherbourg]]. The British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and [[Gold Beach]]es and Canadians at [[Juno Beach]] would protect the US flank and attempt to establish airfields near Caen on the first day.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592\u2013593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}} (A sixth beach, code-named \"Band\", was considered to the east of the Orne.{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2019|p=136}}) A secure lodgement would be established with all invading forces linked together, and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the [[Avranches]]-[[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] line within the first three weeks.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592\u2013593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}} Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, lasting until all Allied forces reached the River [[Seine]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=698}}\n\n==Deception plans==\n[[File:Ghost Army.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder patches were designed for units of the fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] under [[George Patton]]. ]]\nUnder the overall umbrella of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the Allied landings.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=680}} [[Operation Fortitude]] included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway,{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=465}} and Fortitude South, a major deception involving the creation of a fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] under Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], supposedly located in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]]. Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=71\u201372}} Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}} Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=282}}\n\nMany of the German radar stations on the French coast were destroyed in preparation for the landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} In addition, on the night before the invasion, a small group of [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) operators deployed dummy paratroopers over [[Le Havre]] and [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. These dummies led the Germans to believe that an additional airborne landing had occurred. On that same night, in [[Operation Taxable]], [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] dropped strips of \"window\", [[Chaff (countermeasure)|metal foil]] that caused a radar return which was mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy near Le Havre. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing [[barrage balloon]]s. A similar deception was undertaken near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in the Pas de Calais area by [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]] in [[Operation Glimmer]].{{sfn|Bickers|1994|pp=19\u201321}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=76}}\n\n==Weather==\nThe invasion planners determined a set of conditions involving the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that would be satisfactory on only a few days in each month. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the [[Tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|highest tides]]. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles on the beach, while minimising the amount of time the men would be exposed in the open.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault.

He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed as close to the coast as possible. Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected. They believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. He also noted that in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way. Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three [[Panzer division]]s under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves.

German preparations along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete in some areas as resources were diverted elsewhere.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=290}} The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=343}} The Allies achieved and maintained [[air supremacy]], which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=289}} Infrastructure for transport in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, making it difficult for the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=36}} Some of the opening bombardment was off-target or not concentrated enough to have any impact,{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=91}} but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha, providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=291}} Indecisiveness and an overly complicated command structure on the part of the German high command were also factors in the Allied success.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=292}}\n\n==War memorials and tourism==\nAt Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain.

In 2005 in the Caribbean, a rise in the sea surface temperature is thought to have caused widespread coral bleaching. In this study, they evaluate if this increase in sea surface temperature was due to natural climate variability or human activity. They concluded that it would be very unlikely that natural climate variability alone could account for this event. Their model suggests that this event would occur once every 1000 years if human activity is not taken into consideration in the model.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Simon D. Donner|author2=Thomas R.

Coral bleaching is an effect of the change in climate because of the rise in water temperature in the seawater. The coral is also being used as a \"natural resource\" for the natives to create cement and aggregate because they aren't provided with the same materials as are other countries.\n\n==Social and economic impacts==\n\nMultiple sources suggest that the Caribbean is in a particularly difficult position to address climate change.<ref name=\"Batiste2016\" /><ref name=\"Reyer2017\" /> The Caribbean's long history of colonialism for the extraction of goods, such as sugar, has left them dependent on colonial entities. This has created a disadvantage to the Caribbean as they lack the ability to compete with the current [[world economy]] and be self-sufficient. Centuries of [[colonialism]] has generated a feedback loop of the dependence of the Caribbean's economy on global powers.<ref name=Batiste2016 />\n\nThe damages expected from climate change will weaken the economy of the Caribbean as it will target some of the major sources of income, like tourism. It has been estimated that 25% to 35% of the Caribbean's economy relies on tourism.<ref name=\"Lewsey2004\" /> Tourism could be significantly reduced if less tourists travel to the Caribbean because of an increase in the strength and likelihood of hurricanes in the next century. It is expected that hurricane costs are expected to range between US$350 to $550 million or about 11% to 17% of the current [[GDP]] for hurricane damages annually. They expect that the Bahamas, Haiti, and Jamaica are the islands that will suffer the most from climate change. In addition, they suggest that agricultural and rural areas are among the sectors that will be most affected by hurricanes in the Caribbean. They estimate that damages to these areas could cost about US$3 million per year by 2050 and US$12 \u2013 $15 million by 2100.<ref name=\"Reyer2017\" />\n\n== Cultural Impacts ==\nThere are a variety of people that live on the Caribbean islands and they are heavily impacted on the effects of climate change. Culturally, the peoples of the Caribbean are a mix of Africa, Asian, European, and Indigenous peoples.<ref>Coastal Education & Research. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25736087?seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents. \"Climate change impacts on the Caribbean coastal areas and tourism\".

The warmer the air temperature, the more water can be held by air leading to more [[precipitation]]. Multiple sources suggest that this increase in strengthening and precipitation in recent hurricanes is due to climate change.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Michael|title=Climate change in the Caribbean \u2013 learning lessons from Irma and Maria|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/climate-change-in-the-caribbean-learning-lessons-from-irma-and-maria|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2017-10-06}}</ref><ref name=\"RAIN\" /><ref name=\"CCITCMI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/office-of-evaluation-and-oversight/climate-change-in-the-caribbean-small-island-states,18283.html|title=Climate Change in the Caribbean Small Island States|website=Inter-American Development Bank}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wallace-Wells|first1=David|title=Will Irma Finally Change the Way We Talk About Climate?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/will-irma-finally-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate.html|website=Daily Intelligencer|accessdate=2017-09-09}}</ref> Hurricane Irma and Maria had a total of {{convert|20|inch|order=flip}} of rainfall. In Cuba, Hurricane Irma sustained precipitation was at {{convert|10.8|inch|order=flip}} per hour. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria had a sustained precipitation of {{convert|6.44|inch|order=flip}} per hour.<ref name=\"RAIN\" /> We are seeing repeated and prolonged droughts, an increase in the number of very hot days, intense rainfall events causing repeated localized flooding, and rising sea levels that are consuming the beautiful beaches on which tourism in the region depends.<ref>Taylor, Michael. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/climate-change-in-the-caribbean-learning-lessons-from-irma-and-maria. \"Climate change in the Caribbean- Learning lessons from Irma and Maria\". 6 October 2017.</ref>\n\nAn increase in surface temperature has also been suggested to affect the [[coral reef]]s. In 2005 in the Caribbean, a rise in the sea surface temperature is thought to have caused widespread coral bleaching. In this study, they evaluate if this increase in sea surface temperature was due to natural climate variability or human activity. They concluded that it would be very unlikely that natural climate variability alone could account for this event. Their model suggests that this event would occur once every 1000 years if human activity is not taken into consideration in the model.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Simon D. Donner|author2=Thomas R. Knutson|title=Model-based assessment of the role of human-induced climate change in the 2005 Caribbean coral bleaching event|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2007-03-27|volume=104|issue=13|pages=5483\u20135488|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610122104|pmid=17360373|pmc=1838457}}</ref> Coral reefs are a huge part of the Caribbean ocean and an important aspect to their ecosystem. Coral bleaching is an effect of the change in climate because of the rise in water temperature in the seawater. The coral is also being used as a \"natural resource\" for the natives to create cement and aggregate because they aren't provided with the same materials as are other countries.\n\n==Social and economic impacts==\n\nMultiple sources suggest that the Caribbean is in a particularly difficult position to address climate change.<ref name=\"Batiste2016\" /><ref name=\"Reyer2017\" /> The Caribbean's long history of colonialism for the extraction of goods, such as sugar, has left them dependent on colonial entities. This has created a disadvantage to the Caribbean as they lack the ability to compete with the current [[world economy]] and be self-sufficient. Centuries of [[colonialism]] has generated a feedback loop of the dependence of the Caribbean's economy on global powers.<ref name=Batiste2016 />\n\nThe damages expected from climate change will weaken the economy of the Caribbean as it will target some of the major sources of income, like tourism. It has been estimated that 25% to 35% of the Caribbean's economy relies on tourism.<ref name=\"Lewsey2004\" /> Tourism could be significantly reduced if less tourists travel to the Caribbean because of an increase in the strength and likelihood of hurricanes in the next century. It is expected that hurricane costs are expected to range between US$350 to $550 million or about 11% to 17% of the current [[GDP]] for hurricane damages annually. They expect that the Bahamas, Haiti, and Jamaica are the islands that will suffer the most from climate change. In addition, they suggest that agricultural and rural areas are among the sectors that will be most affected by hurricanes in the Caribbean. They estimate that damages to these areas could cost about US$3 million per year by 2050 and US$12 \u2013 $15 million by 2100.<ref name=\"Reyer2017\" />\n\n== Cultural Impacts ==\nThere are a variety of people that live on the Caribbean islands and they are heavily impacted on the effects of climate change. Culturally, the peoples of the Caribbean are a mix of Africa, Asian, European, and Indigenous peoples.<ref>Coastal Education & Research. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25736087?seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents. \"Climate change impacts on the Caribbean coastal areas and tourism\". ISSUE NO. 24. pp. 49-69.</ref> [[Tourism]] is an important aspect in the Caribbeans economy. Without it economies will collapse and residents will struggle more than they already are. The impact of climate change on tourism will lead to unknown results and many difficulties for the islands. The coastal region, where tourist reside on their trips, is nothing like the original residence for the natives.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Climate change]] (modern day)\n* [[Climate change (general concept)]]\n* [[Hurricane Irma]]\n* [[Caribbean Sea]]\n* [[Coral bleaching]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}Added Links:\n\n# https://www.jstor.org/stable/41917607?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CARIBBEAN: REVIEW AND RESPONSE\n# https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010EO160002 Volcanic Vents Found in Deep Caribbean Waters\n\n==Further reading== \n* {{cite report|author=U.S. Global Change Research Program|year=2018|chapter=U.S. Caribbean|title=Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States: Fourth National Climate Assessment, Volume II|publisher=U.S. Global Change Research Program|place=Washington, DC, USA|page=809\u2013871|doi=10.7930/NCA4.2018.CH20|doi-access=free}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Regional effects of global warming]]\n[[Category:Climate change]]\n[[Category:Climate change articles needing expert attention]]\n", "name_user": "CaribDigita", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFurther reading", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_the_Caribbean"}
