EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE. (Please verify that these tags are not removed or displaced when using the visual editor) -->\n<!-- 1. Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard the two flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. <!-- 2. MCAS -->A week after the first accident, Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) sent airlines urgent messages to emphasize an existing [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|procedure]] that pilots should follow to recover from [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] possibly caused by a new flight control feature, the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which Boeing had intentionally omitted from MAX crew manuals and training. In a private analysis, the FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|predicted more accidents]] if MCAS was not revised, but believed the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] it issued would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3. Groundings -->\nEthiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. The FAA publicly asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] on March 11, then grounded the airplane on March 13 after receiving evidence of  accident similarities. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 5.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] criticized Boeing's \"culture of concealment\" during certification and in the aftermath of both accidents.<section end=\"summary\" />\n<!-- THE SECTION TAGS ARE PLACED HERE TO ALLOW TRANSCLUSION OF THIS INTRODUCTION into Boeing 737 MAX EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE -->\n<!-- The tags must stay in these locations next to the notes. -->\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* On October 29, 2018, a 737 MAX 8 operating [[Lion Air Flight 610]] crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing 189 people, leading Boeing to publicly unveil the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]], a new automated flight control on the MAX that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]], but was omitted from crew manuals and training.<ref name=Flight13mar2020/>\n* On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued a [[service bulletin]] warning that with \"erroneous {{abbr|AOA|angle of attack}} data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\" which \"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|Runaway stabilizer and manual trim]] procedure.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/boeing-nearing-737-max-fleet-bulletin-on-aoa-warning-after-lion-air-crash/ |title= Boeing nearing 737 Max fleet bulletin on AoA warning after Lion Air crash |date= November 7, 2018 |work= The Air Current |author= Jon Ostrower}}</ref> \n* On November 7, the FAA issued an [[Emergency airworthiness directive]] requiring revising \"the {{abbr|AFM|aircraft flight manual}} to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\" when \"repeated nose-down trim commands\" are caused by \"an erroneously high single AOA sensor\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf |title= Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-23-51 |date= November 7, 2018 |publisher= FAA}}</ref>\n* On December 3, the FAA conducted an unpublished \"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology\u201d (TARAM) [[Boeing 737 MAX certification#Boeing 737 safety analysis|analysis]] that concluded, \"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 Max could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet\u201d;

Accidents -->\n<section begin=\"summary\" />In March 2019, [[National aviation authority|aviation authorities]] around the world [[Aircraft on ground|grounded]] the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] passenger [[airliner]] after two new MAX aircraft crashed within five months, killing all 346 people aboard the two flights, [[Lion Air Flight 610]] on October 29, 2018 and [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] on March 10, 2019. <!-- 2. MCAS -->A week after the first accident, Boeing and the [[U.S. Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) sent airlines urgent messages to emphasize an existing [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|procedure]] that pilots should follow to recover from [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]] possibly caused by a new flight control feature, the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System]] (MCAS), which Boeing had intentionally omitted from MAX crew manuals and training. In a private analysis, the FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|predicted more accidents]] if MCAS was not revised, but believed the [[emergency airworthiness directive]] it issued would suffice until Boeing delivered a permanent solution.\n\n<!-- 3. Groundings -->\nEthiopian Airlines grounded its remaining MAX fleet on March 10, day of the crash. On March 11, the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other regulators in quick succession. The FAA publicly asserted the MAX's [[Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community|continued airworthiness]] on March 11, then grounded the airplane on March 13 after receiving evidence of  accident similarities. By March 18, all 387 airplanes, which served 8,600 flights each week for 59 airlines, were grounded worldwide. Boeing suspended deliveries to airlines, but produced another 400 aircraft before halting manufacturing in January 2020.\n\n<!-- 4.  Aftermath: inquiries -->\nAfter the groundings, the [[U.S. Congress]], FBI and ad hoc panels began investigating FAA [[Boeing 737 MAX certification|certification]] of the MAX, particularly the [[Organization Designation Authorization|delegation of authority]] that allowed Boeing to act on behalf of the FAA. Several [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Supporting systems|system and manufacturing defects]] were uncovered, in addition to problems with MCAS. Boeing eventually reversed its policy and recommended flight simulator training for all MAX pilots. The longest ever grounding for a U.S. airliner was estimated to cost Boeing $18.6 billion by March 2020.<!--ref name=Flight13mar2020-->\n\n<!-- 5.  Aftermath: final reports -->\nInvestigators published their findings on the first anniversaries of the accidents in October 2019 and March 2020. The Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee|NTSC]] faulted airplane design, certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority|ECAA]], which determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure, assigned blame to the aircraft's software design. The U.S. [[NTSB]] concluded that  malfunctions resulted in multiple cockpit alerts that likely confused the flight crews. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] criticized Boeing's \"culture of concealment\" during certification and in the aftermath of both accidents.<section end=\"summary\" />\n<!-- THE SECTION TAGS ARE PLACED HERE TO ALLOW TRANSCLUSION OF THIS INTRODUCTION into Boeing 737 MAX EDITS BETWEEN THE TAGS APPEAR IN THAT ARTICLE -->\n<!-- The tags must stay in these locations next to the notes. -->\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* On {{date|29 October 2018|MDY}}, a 737 MAX 8 operating [[Lion Air Flight 610]] crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing 189 people, leading Boeing to publicly unveil the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]], a new automated flight control on the MAX that could cause unintended [[Descent (aeronautics)#Dives|nosedives]], but was omitted from crew manuals and training.<ref name=Flight13mar2020/>\n* On November 6, 2018, Boeing issued a [[service bulletin]] warning that with \"erroneous {{abbr|AOA|angle of attack}} data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\" which \"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System#Runaway stabilizer and manual trim|Runaway stabilizer and manual trim]] procedure.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/boeing-nearing-737-max-fleet-bulletin-on-aoa-warning-after-lion-air-crash/ |title= Boeing nearing 737 Max fleet bulletin on AoA warning after Lion Air crash |date= November 7, 2018 |work= The Air Current |author= Jon Ostrower}}</ref> \n* On November 7, 2018, the FAA issued an [[Emergency airworthiness directive]] requiring revising \"the {{abbr|AFM|aircraft flight manual}} to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\" when \"repeated nose-down trim commands\" are caused by \"an erroneously high single AOA sensor\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgad.nsf/0/83ec7f95f3e5bfbd8625833e0070a070/$FILE/2018-23-51_Emergency.pdf |title= Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-23-51 |date= November 7, 2018 |publisher= FAA}}</ref>\n* On December 3, 2018, the FAA conducted an unpublished \"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology\u201d (TARAM) [[Boeing 737 MAX certification#Boeing 737 safety analysis|analysis]] that concluded, \"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 Max could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet\u201d;

During the [[American Revolution]], Newburgh served as the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]]. Prior to its chartering in 1865, the city of Newburgh was part of the [[Newburgh (town), New York|town of Newburgh]]; the town now borders the city to the north and west. East of the city is the [[Hudson River]]; the city of [[Beacon, New York]] is across the river and it is connected to Newburgh via the [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge]].

The area that became Newburgh was first explored by Europeans when [[Henry Hudson]] stopped by during his 1609 expedition up the river that now bears his name. His navigator, Robert Juet, is said to have called the site \"a pleasant place to build a town\",<ref name=con>[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/city-history/pages/early-days \"City History\", City of Newburgh]</ref> although some later historians believe he may actually have been referring to the area where [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] now stands.\n\nAround 1683 [[Province of New York|provincial governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]] purchased the land from the Woaranek people. The first settlement was made in the spring of 1709 by fifty-four [[Palatinate region|Palatine refugees]], sponsored by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne of Great Britain]]. The settlers named it the Palatine Parish by Quassic. In 1743 a ferry at the foot of First Street had been established between Newburgh and Fishkill Landing (now [[Beacon, New York]]).<ref name=Barrett/> In 1752 the land had been surveyed by [[Cadwallader Colden]] and named \"Newburgh\" after Newburgh in his native Scotland.<ref name=con/> Shipyards were established and docks and warehouses lined the waterfront.\n\nNewburgh was the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]] from March 1782 until late 1783.<ref name=con/> While the army was camped at Newburgh, some of its senior officers began the \"[[Newburgh conspiracy]]\" to overthrow the government. General [[George Washington]] was able to persuade his officers to stay loyal to him. The army was disbanded here in 1783. Washington received the famous [[Newburgh letter]] from [[Lewis Nicola]] proposing that he become [[monarch|king]] here. It drew a vigorous rebuke from Washington. In honor of his refusal of that suggestion, Kings Highway, the north-south street on which the Newburgh headquarters is located, was renamed Liberty Street.<ref name=hsn>[http://www.newburghhistoricalsociety.com/history/newburgh-history/ \"Newburgh History\", Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands]</ref>\n\n=== Municipal growth ===\n[[File:1842 engraving of Newburgh, NY.jpg|thumb|Woodcut of Newburgh skyline from Hudson in 1842, with [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], then with its original dome and lantern]]\n[[File:Water Street, Newburgh, N.Y. det.4a13482.jpg|thumb|Water Street in Newburgh, photo taken circa 1906; the buildings on the street were demolished as part of urban renewal efforts in the 1960s and 1970]][[File:Newburgh NY Columbus Statue.JPG|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] Statue on Newburgh's Waterfront]]\nThe year 1793 saw Newburgh's first newspaper, ''The Newburgh Packet''. The hamlet of Newburgh was incorporated as a village in 1800. At the time of its settlement it was in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] and was that county's seat. When [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] was split from Orange County in 1798, Newburgh and the other towns north of [[Moodna Creek]] were put in a redrawn Orange County. Newburgh thus lost its status as the county seat to [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]]. The former Ulster County courthouse still stands as Newburgh's old city courthouse building (currently used as municipal office space).\n\nBy 1793 there were four sloop lines operating out of Newburgh. As new turnpikes opened trade extended into the interior, passenger coaches and farm wagons raveled as far west as [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]. This was the shortest route from the Hudson to [[Western New York]]. By 1819 a steamboat on [[Cayuga Lake]] connected Newburgh stage lines with Ithaca. Streets leading to the river were often blocked for hours with farmers' wagons waiting to be unloaded at the wharves. With the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] much of the traffic from the [[Southern Tier]] was diverted. In 1830 Richard Carpenter of Newburgh had the steamboat ''William Young'' built at [[Chelsea, Dutchess County, New York|Low Point]]; it ran between Newburgh and Albany.<ref name=\"Nutt\">Nutt, John J., ''Newburgh, her Institutions, Industries, and Leading citizens'', Ritchie & Hull, Newburgh, NY, 1891</ref> Prosperity returned with the arrival of the railroads.\n\nOn the evening of September 24, 1824, beacon fires in the [[Hudson Highlands]] announced the arrival of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|the Marquis de Lafayette]]. Having been feted in New York, he sailed upriver on the chartered steamer ''James Kent''. The next day, people came from the surrounding towns to catch a glimpse of the general as he made his way to a reception at the Orange Hotel. The Rev. John Brown of St. George's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] was part of the welcoming committee. At 2&nbsp;am., Lafayette sailed from Reeve & Falls dock for Poughkeepsie.<ref name=\"Nutt\" />\n\nThe [[Erie Railroad]] charter was amended April 8, 1845, to allow the building of the Newburgh Branch, running from the main line near Harriman north-northeast to Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. The branch opened January 8, 1850.<ref name=\"Nutt\" /> It was later used as a connection to the [[New York and New England Railroad]] via a car float operation across the river to [[Beacon, New York]].\n\nNewburgh was chartered as a city in April 1865.\n\nNewburgh became quite prosperous during the [[Gilded Age]] that followed. Newburgh had telephone service in 1879.<ref name=\"Barrett\" /> In 1883 there was a steamboat landing on Second Street. The United States Hotel was on Front Street opposite the landing.

In October 1939, [[RCA]] chose to test-market televisions in Newburgh, which was within range of the television signal of RCA's experimental station [[W2XBS]]. 600 sets were sold in Newburgh at a deep discount. The test-marketing campaign's success encouraged RCA to go forward with developing the new medium. Additionally, with consumer television production ceasing during [[World War II]], those Newburgh households which purchased televisions during 1939 and 1940 were among the few to enjoy television (albeit with a greatly reduced programming schedule) during the war.<ref>von Schilling, James, ''The Magic Window: American Television, 1939\u20131953'' New York: Haworth Press, 2003</ref>\n\nNewburgh was one of the first cities in the country to fluoridate its water in 1945.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Mullen J  |title=History of water fluoridation |journal=Br Dent J |volume=199 |issue=7s |pages=1\u20134 |year=2005 |pmid=16215546 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4812863 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finn |first1=Sindey |title=Progress Report on Newburgh-Kingston N.Y.

The Hudson River, which previously served as the main means of transporting goods, lost much of its shipping traffic to [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking]]. The city's trolley system was shut down in 1924 in favor of buses. The nation moved to the automobile for transportation and, as with many other cities, there was a resulting [[Suburbanization|migration to the suburbs]]. In 1963 the [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge]] was opened, carrying [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and spanning the Hudson River, bypassing the Newburgh waterfront and the city of Newburgh altogether. The ferry closed down soon thereafter\u2014it was not [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Ferry|revived]] until 2005\u2014and the waterfront area declined rapidly.\n\nIn 1962, Lloyd's Department Store became the first major shopping center in Newburgh. Its motto was \"Years Ahead\". Many features of Lloyd's, including widely divergent ministores under one roof, did not become common in other shopping centers for many decades. Lloyd's successfully drew a great deal of retail business away from the downtown area. In 1964, the Mid Valley Mall opened, also outside of the city limits in Newburgh, and attracted many long-established local businesses away from the waterfront and downtown city of Newburgh. Other retail shopping malls soon sprang up, all also outside the city of Newburgh, and the retail industry of the city declined further. The city continued to lose its previously well regarded retail sector along Water Street and Broadway to the suburban shopping malls, which did not share the city's congested parking and traffic problems or the perceived rising crime rate.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the city's response to the economic decline was an ambitious [[urban renewal]] plan. The city's historic waterfront area, an area composed of several square blocks which included numerous historically significant buildings, was completely [[demolition|demolished]] between 1970 and 1973. Residents were relocated, or were supposed to be relocated, to newer [[housing project]]s around Muchattoes Lake in the city's interior.\n\nA grand complex that was planned for the urban renewal area was never built when state and federal spending began to dry up after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. To this day, the blocks which slope down to the river remain open, grassy slopes, offering sweeping views of the Hudson but generating no [[property tax]]es for the city. Public sentiment is mixed on whether they should be built on again at all, and the city's view-protection ordinances make it less likely. Below, the waterfront was developed in the late 1990s after the city was once again able to secure grants from the state's Environmental Protection fund for [[riprap]] (a type of stone) to stabilize the shoreline.\n\n[[File:Joseph Mitchell NBC White Paper 3.jpg|thumb|right|City manager Joseph Mitchell attending the Newburgh City Council in 1961]]\nIn the early 1960s, city manager [[Joseph McDowell Mitchell]] and the council attracted nationwide attention and the admiration of political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] when they attempted to require welfare recipients to pick up their payments at police headquarters. Mitchell later announced a program aimed largely at Blacks and African Americans on welfare, whom many in the community blamed for its economic problems. The program would have denied welfare payments to all after three months except the aged, the blind and the handicapped. Those affected would have largely been single mothers of young children, the only category in which blacks were predominant. After opposition by both state and federal officials, the program created a national controversy and never went into effect. Along with the failed urban renewal, the mid to late 1960s in Newburgh were also marked by [[Ethnic conflict|race riots]] and other tensions.\n\nNewburgh in the early 21st century is more racially diverse than it used to be, as a growing [[Latin American]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] population (mainly of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent) complements the city's sizable [[African Americans|African American]] contingent. [[Economic development]] has been a major concern, but poorly realized, as the good jobs once found in the local manufacturing sector have not been replaced. Pockets of [[poverty]] persist in the city, often mere blocks away from its many historical and architectural [[landmark]]s. In addition to this, the city has been facing issues regarding [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], like many other cities across the United States, ranging from overcrowded apartment buildings to mild racial conflict.\n\nIn spite of this Newburgh is experiencing a spurt of new businesses on its historic Liberty Street near Washington's Headquarters. An art supply store, a gourmet food market, an antiques store, a used furniture shop, a souvenir shop, a flower shop, a bakery and a restaurant have joined an existing caf\u00e9, a graphic design shop and two additional antiques stores in the final months of 2008 and January 2009. This is all in the midst of the redevelopment of East Parmenter Street in a partnership with [[Habitat for Humanity]] and a private developer to build 24 new houses. The city has completed the overhaul of the infrastructure of the street.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Newburgh from the bridge.jpg|thumb|View of Newburgh from the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]], 2006|alt=A city on a slope over a body of water with larger buildings at the left and center right.

The movement to stop it led to the development of [[Montgomery\u2013Grand\u2013Liberty Streets Historic District|a historic district]], now the second largest in New York State. The church was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] three years later, and in 2001 became the city's second [[National Historic Landmark]] after Washington's Headquarters.\n\nThe city was designated a Preserve America community in 2005 and it also signed an agreement with the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Office of Historic Preservation]] as a Certified Local Government community.

Rev. Michael J. Phelan was appointed pastor, and said his first mass in the parish on Easter Sunday, 1875, in the opera-house. The Wilson property at Gidney Avenue and South Street was purchased and mass celebrated in the mansion on the premises. In May following a temporary frame building for church purposes was erected.

The people of the parish, and of the Newburgh community as a whole, rose up in protest and the Archdiocese withdrew the proposal. Then, in the summer of 2015, the archdiocese proposed closing the parish yet again, and while the community protests eclipsed those of 2005, this time the proposal was carried through. St. Mary's Parish was merged with St. Patrick's effective August 1, 2015. The church building was shuttered and closed and has not been used since that date. Father William Scafidi, the pastor and arguably the most popular community leader in Newburgh at that time, was transferred by the Archdiocese to a parish church in [[Liberty, New York]].\n\n==== St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church ====\nIn December 1908, Father Francis Fabian, pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish in Rondout visited Newburgh. Seeing that there the city had only two churches serving a large Catholic population, Fr. Fabian began to look into establishing another parish. Meetings were held and funds were raised and on April 22, 1909, Archbishop [[John Murphy Farley|John Farley]] of New York appointed Fr Fabian pastor of the new congregation.

The church was completed on August 15, 1909, and a rectory completed that same year. The parish grew so rapidly that two-year later excavation was begun for a new stone church on a hill east of the rectory. Services were continued in the old chapel until September 1, 1913 when the new church was dedicated. The interior has beautiful Bavarian stained glass windows and a large mural behind the altar that was painted in Bavaria. The Tracker organ was built in 1862. It has 2600 pipes and two keyboards.

The parish became separate from St. Patrick's on September 8, 1912. Land was purchased on the southeast corner of Robinson Avenue and Ann Street. A temporary chapel situated in a vacant store at 286 Washington Street was used until the church was completed.

Partly due to [[suburbanization]] and other economic factors the city suffered an economic decline from the 1960s to first quarter of the 21st century. Currently over 11,400 residents are employed within the city limits.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe largest industries as of 2020 were [[retail]], [[Health care in the United States|healthcare]] and social assistance, [[Foodservice|food services]], [[finance]], [[public administration]], and [[For-profit education|educational services]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://datausa.io/profile/geo/newburgh-ny|title=Newburgh, NY {{!}} Data USA|website=datausa.io |access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Being in close proximity to other major [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] cities, it serves as a significant location for [[Stop & Shop]], [[M&T Bank]], [[Chase Bank]], [[Verizon Communications]], [[Charter Communications]], [[Dunkin' Donuts|Dunkin']], [[McDonald's]], [[Metro by T-Mobile]], [[Boost Mobile]], and [[Marshalls]]. The city's economy is also stimulated by several hospitals and educational institutions including the [[Veterans Health Administration|VA Hudson Valley Heathcare System]], the [[Newburgh Enlarged City School District]], and [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Media ==\nNewburgh is within the [[media market]] of New York City and [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]]. It is served by ''[[Times Herald-Record|The Times Herald-Record]]'', ''The Hudson Valley Press'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[El Diario La Prensa]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'', and other newspapers local to the area. Its television market features [[News 12 Networks|News 12]] Hudson Valley, a regional television channel marketed toward the Hudson River Valley Area.\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|Poughkeepsie\u2013Newburgh\u2013Middletown metropolitan area#Colleges and universities}}\nIn 1978 students at [[Newburgh Free Academy]], the city's public high school, boycotted classes. This ultimately led to a major reorganization of the school system. Newburgh is served by the [[Newburgh Enlarged City School District]].<ref>[http://www.newburghschools.org/newburgh/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716004100/http://www.newburghschools.org/newburgh/index.html |date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe local high school is called [[Newburgh Free Academy]], and its the largest public high school in Orange County. It serves approximately 3,000 students in grades 9\u201312 from the Newburgh area. Newburgh Free Academy is currently split into three campuses, with NFA Main located on Fullerton Avenue, NFA North located on Robinson Avenue a few blocks away, and NFA West located on West Street. Between the three campuses, there are roughly over 4,300 students enrolled. Two colleges are located in Newburgh, [[Mount Saint Mary College]] and the Newburgh campus of [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n=== Police ===\nNewburgh's early police department consisted of twenty-two officers. On April 6, 1869 the Newburgh Police Department was authorized with regulations by the Common Council Ordinance. The first headquarters of the department was on First Street between Montgomery and Smith Street. Its current headquarters is located in the Newburgh City Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/police/pages/history|title=History {{!}} Newburgh NY|website=www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Fire ===\nThe city of Newburgh is protected by the firefighters of the City of Newburgh Fire Department which operates out of two citywide firehouses. The department runs a frontline apparatus fleet of four engine companies (including two reserve engines), two ladder companies (including one reserve ladder), one fire boat, one fire alarm truck, and seven support units. It also houses and runs one of the Orange County Technical Rescue trailers as well as a foam trailer as part of the NYS Foam Task Force.\n\nNewburgh's fire department is one of the oldest chartered departments in New York State being established by an act of the young state legislature on March 24, 1797. The earliest Newburgh fire companies were the Protection Engine Company, Cataract Engine Co., Washington Engine Co., and Empire Hook & Ladder. More appeared as neighborhoods expanded. The department purchased its first steam engine in 1872. In its inaugural test, the engine threw a stream of water over the top of the cross of St. Patrick's Church, 161 feet high, to the delight of the citizens watching. The first firefighter to die in the line of duty, Joseph Tillotson, burned to death in a fire at The Bleachery on Lake Street in 1887. In March 1889, the city purchased and installed a modern electric telegraph fire alarm system with 23 alarm boxes placed around the city, these boxes are still in service today. As horses were phased out of service, Ringgold Hose on Colden Street was the first of Newburgh's companies to get a motorized fire truck in 1907. As early as 1915, editorials were calling for the establishment of a paid fire department to assure the response necessary for a densely populated and heavily commercial and industrial city like Newburgh. Beginning with drivers, tillermen and then officers, paid positions for full-time firemen were gradually created for each company. In 1934, the volunteer companies disbanded, and a professional department was instituted by resolution of the City Council. Protection has a cost. Eight men have perished in the line of duty during the department's history: Joseph Tillotson, Willis Meginn, James Hunter, Moses Embler, Armand Santacroce, Edward Maney, Frederick Carpenter and Patrick Bardin.<ref name=\"Newburgh Fire History\">[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211144153/http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nNewburgh was ranked more dangerous than 95 percent of US cities by website ''[[NeighborhoodScout]]'', based on 2012 FBI crime data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/newburgh/crime/ |title=Newburgh NY crime rates and statistics |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> This group also ranked Newburgh as the 10th most dangerous place to live in the United States based on the same 2012 dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2013/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2013 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> It was ranked at number 12 in the previous year's rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2012/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2012 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, ''The New York Times'' wrote an extensive article on gang activity in Newburgh.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/nyregion/12newburgh.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=In Newburgh, Gangs and Violence Reign|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Newburgh began implementing a program called \"Group Violence Intervention,\" an example of focused deterrence.<ref>https://nnscommunities.org/impact/city/newburgh</ref> In 2017, Newburgh reported the lowest crime rates in 10 years.<ref>http://www.recordonline.com/news/20180123/newburgh-crime-rates-lowest-in-over-10-years</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Broadway, Newburgh NY.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Broadway, 2006]]\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please note that vandalism of this page will not be tolerated; this includes unregistered IP addresses.\nVandalism includes adding of your own views, deleting large sections of text, and inserting manifestly false information.

Allegations of [[electoral fraud]] had dogged the city's first African American woman mayor, Audrey Carey, since her 1991 victory in a four-way race. Supporters of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Regina Angelo alleged that many registered voters in neighborhoods Carey had carried heavily used false addresses. In response, four years later deputy [[sheriff]]s were stationed at polling places and challenged voters to provide proof of residency and identity. Although she won, Carey's supporters claimed that the deputy sheriffs had singled out minority voters for such challenges, and accused the Republicans of [[voter suppression]]. These tensions were only aggravated when the council selected the city's Republican chairman at the time, Harry Porr, as the new city manager. Carey was defeated by Tyrone Crabb, a black man running on the Republican line, in 1999. Porr was fired, rehired and fired again in 2001. Crabb died suddenly of a heart attack ten days before he was slated to take office. The vacancy was filled by his widow, Mary.\n\nDespite demographics and urban trends favoring [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the voters of the city had until recent years regularly voted across party lines. Nicholas Valentine, mayor from 2003 until 2011 and several other recent mayors and council members were Republicans. The late [[Thomas Kirwan]]\u2014a resident who served in the [[New York State Assembly]] until 2008\u2014and was re-elected in a successful comeback bid in 2010, by one of the smallest margins in state history (15 votes), was a Republican. He died late in 2011. On March 20, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in which former Assemblyman [[Frank Skartados]], Democrat, won by a large margin. In the general election held in November 2011, a newcomer to the city named Judith Kennedy was overwhelmingly elected Mayor over incumbent Republican Councilwoman Christine Bello. In addition, the Democratic candidates for Council seats, Gay Lee and Cedric Brown, were also overwhelmingly elected. Accordingly, the council is now 5-0 Democrat\u2014the first time in recorded history one party monopolizes the Newburgh city government.\n\nAn independent documentary was made in 2004 about the mayoral race in Newburgh, called ''[[Saving Newburgh]]''.\n\nIn 2009, the Republican party did not field its own candidates for city council. Instead the Republican Committee endorsed two Democrats\u2014one a former councilman, the other an incumbent councilwoman\u2014and they were not opposed for the Republican nomination in the primary despite their being registered Democrats. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] and [[Independence Party of New York|Independence]] parties both nominated them also. They lost the Democratic primary and despite their appearing on three party lines they lost the November election to two straight Democrats, both one time Republicans.<ref>Certified election returns available from the Orange County Board of Elections.</ref>\n\nNewburgh declared itself a [[sanctuary city]] in March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordonline.com/news/20170313/newburgh-council-approves-sanctuary-city-immigration-policy|title=Newburgh Council approves 'sanctuary city' immigration policy|last=Sparks|first=Leonard|date=March 13, 2017|website=recordonline.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nDelano-Hitch formerly served as the home field for the [[Newburgh Black Diamonds]] and [[Newburgh Nighthawks]] baseball teams.\n\nThe [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].

During the [[American Revolution]], Newburgh served as the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]]. Prior to its chartering in 1865, the city of Newburgh was part of the [[Newburgh (town), New York|town of Newburgh]]; the town now borders the city to the north and west.

The area that became Newburgh was first explored by Europeans when [[Henry Hudson]] stopped by during his 1609 expedition up the river that now bears his name. His navigator, Robert Juet, is said to have called the site \"a pleasant place to build a town\",<ref name=con>[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/city-history/pages/early-days \"City History\", City of Newburgh]</ref> although some later historians believe he may actually have been referring to the area where [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] now stands.\n\nAround 1683 [[Province of New York|provincial governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]] purchased the land from the Woaranek people. The first settlement was made in the spring of 1709 by fifty-four [[Palatinate region|Palatine refugees]], sponsored by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne of Great Britain]]. The settlers named it the Palatine Parish by Quassic. In 1743 a ferry at the foot of First Street had been established between Newburgh and Fishkill Landing (now [[Beacon, New York]]).<ref name=Barrett/> In 1752 the land had been surveyed by [[Cadwallader Colden]] and named \"Newburgh\" after Newburgh in his native Scotland.<ref name=con/> Shipyards were established and docks and warehouses lined the waterfront.\n\nNewburgh was the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]] from March 1782 until late 1783.<ref name=con/> While the army was camped at Newburgh, some of its senior officers began the \"[[Newburgh conspiracy]]\" to overthrow the government. General [[George Washington]] was able to persuade his officers to stay loyal to him. The army was disbanded here in 1783. Washington received the famous [[Newburgh letter]] from [[Lewis Nicola]] proposing that he become [[monarch|king]] here. It drew a vigorous rebuke from Washington. In honor of his refusal of that suggestion, Kings Highway, the north-south street on which the Newburgh headquarters is located, was renamed Liberty Street.<ref name=hsn>[http://www.newburghhistoricalsociety.com/history/newburgh-history/ \"Newburgh History\", Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands]</ref>\n\n=== Municipal growth ===\n[[File:1842 engraving of Newburgh, NY.jpg|thumb|Woodcut of Newburgh skyline from Hudson in 1842, with [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], then with its original dome and lantern]]\n[[File:Water Street, Newburgh, N.Y. det.4a13482.jpg|thumb|Water Street in Newburgh, photo taken circa 1906; the buildings on the street were demolished as part of urban renewal efforts in the 1960s and 1970]][[File:Newburgh NY Columbus Statue.JPG|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] Statue on Newburgh's Waterfront]]\nThe year 1793 saw Newburgh's first newspaper, ''The Newburgh Packet''. The hamlet of Newburgh was incorporated as a village in 1800. At the time of its settlement it was in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] and was that county's seat. When [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] was split from Orange County in 1798, Newburgh and the other towns north of [[Moodna Creek]] were put in a redrawn Orange County. Newburgh thus lost its status as the county seat to [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]]. The former Ulster County courthouse still stands as Newburgh's old city courthouse building (currently used as municipal office space).\n\nBy 1793 there were four sloop lines operating out of Newburgh. As new turnpikes opened trade extended into the interior, passenger coaches and farm wagons raveled as far west as [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]. This was the shortest route from the Hudson to [[Western New York]]. By 1819 a steamboat on [[Cayuga Lake]] connected Newburgh stage lines with Ithaca. Streets leading to the river were often blocked for hours with farmers' wagons waiting to be unloaded at the wharves. With the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] much of the traffic from the [[Southern Tier]] was diverted. In 1830 Richard Carpenter of Newburgh had the steamboat ''William Young'' built at [[Chelsea, Dutchess County, New York|Low Point]]; it ran between Newburgh and Albany.<ref name=\"Nutt\">Nutt, John J., ''Newburgh, her Institutions, Industries, and Leading citizens'', Ritchie & Hull, Newburgh, NY, 1891</ref> Prosperity returned with the arrival of the railroads.\n\nOn the evening of September 24, 1824, beacon fires in the [[Hudson Highlands]] announced the arrival of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|the Marquis de Lafayette]]. Having been feted in New York, he sailed upriver on the chartered steamer ''James Kent''. The next day, people came from the surrounding towns to catch a glimpse of the general as he made his way to a reception at the Orange Hotel. The Rev. John Brown of St. George's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] was part of the welcoming committee. At 2&nbsp;am., Lafayette sailed from Reeve & Falls dock for Poughkeepsie.<ref name=\"Nutt\" />\n\nThe [[Erie Railroad]] charter was amended April 8, 1845, to allow the building of the Newburgh Branch, running from the main line near Harriman north-northeast to Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. The branch opened January 8, 1850.<ref name=\"Nutt\" /> It was later used as a connection to the [[New York and New England Railroad]] via a car float operation across the river to [[Beacon, New York]].\n\nNewburgh was chartered as a city in April 1865.\n\nNewburgh became quite prosperous during the [[Gilded Age]] that followed. Newburgh had telephone service in 1879.<ref name=\"Barrett\" /> In 1883 there was a steamboat landing on Second Street. The United States Hotel was on Front Street opposite the landing.

In October 1939, [[RCA]] chose to test-market televisions in Newburgh, which was within range of the television signal of RCA's experimental station [[W2XBS]]. 600 sets were sold in Newburgh at a deep discount. The test-marketing campaign's success encouraged RCA to go forward with developing the new medium. Additionally, with consumer television production ceasing during [[World War II]], those Newburgh households which purchased televisions during 1939 and 1940 were among the few to enjoy television (albeit with a greatly reduced programming schedule) during the war.<ref>von Schilling, James, ''The Magic Window: American Television, 1939\u20131953'' New York: Haworth Press, 2003</ref>\n\nNewburgh was one of the first cities in the country to fluoridate its water in 1945.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Mullen J  |title=History of water fluoridation |journal=Br Dent J |volume=199 |issue=7s |pages=1\u20134 |year=2005 |pmid=16215546 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4812863 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finn |first1=Sindey |title=Progress Report on Newburgh-Kingston N.Y.

The Hudson River, which previously served as the main means of transporting goods, lost much of its shipping traffic to [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking]]. The city's trolley system was shut down in 1924 in favor of buses. The nation moved to the automobile for transportation and, as with many other cities, there was a resulting [[Suburbanization|migration to the suburbs]]. In 1963 the [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge]] was opened, carrying [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and spanning the Hudson River, bypassing the Newburgh waterfront and the city of Newburgh altogether. The ferry closed down soon thereafter\u2014it was not [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Ferry|revived]] until 2005\u2014and the waterfront area declined rapidly.\n\nIn 1962, Lloyd's Department Store became the first major shopping center in Newburgh. Its motto was \"Years Ahead\". Many features of Lloyd's, including widely divergent ministores under one roof, did not become common in other shopping centers for many decades. Lloyd's successfully drew a great deal of retail business away from the downtown area. In 1964, the Mid Valley Mall opened, also outside of the city limits in Newburgh, and attracted many long-established local businesses away from the waterfront and downtown city of Newburgh. Other retail shopping malls soon sprang up, all also outside the city of Newburgh, and the retail industry of the city declined further. The city continued to lose its previously well regarded retail sector along Water Street and Broadway to the suburban shopping malls, which did not share the city's congested parking and traffic problems or the perceived rising crime rate.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the city's response to the economic decline was an ambitious [[urban renewal]] plan. The city's historic waterfront area, an area composed of several square blocks which included numerous historically significant buildings, was completely [[demolition|demolished]] between 1970 and 1973. Residents were relocated, or were supposed to be relocated, to newer [[housing project]]s around Muchattoes Lake in the city's interior.\n\nA grand complex that was planned for the urban renewal area was never built when state and federal spending began to dry up after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. To this day, the blocks which slope down to the river remain open, grassy slopes, offering sweeping views of the Hudson but generating no [[property tax]]es for the city. Public sentiment is mixed on whether they should be built on again at all, and the city's view-protection ordinances make it less likely. Below, the waterfront was developed in the late 1990s after the city was once again able to secure grants from the state's Environmental Protection fund for [[riprap]] (a type of stone) to stabilize the shoreline.\n\n[[File:Joseph Mitchell NBC White Paper 3.jpg|thumb|right|City manager Joseph Mitchell attending the Newburgh City Council in 1961]]\nIn the early 1960s, city manager [[Joseph McDowell Mitchell]] and the council attracted nationwide attention and the admiration of political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] when they attempted to require welfare recipients to pick up their payments at police headquarters. Mitchell later announced a program aimed largely at Blacks and African Americans on welfare, whom many in the community blamed for its economic problems. The program would have denied welfare payments to all after three months except the aged, the blind and the handicapped. Those affected would have largely been single mothers of young children, the only category in which blacks were predominant. After opposition by both state and federal officials, the program created a national controversy and never went into effect. Along with the failed urban renewal, the mid to late 1960s in Newburgh were also marked by [[Ethnic conflict|race riots]] and other tensions.\n\nNewburgh in the early 21st century is more racially diverse than it used to be, as a growing [[Latin American]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] population (mainly of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent) complements the city's sizable [[African Americans|African American]] contingent. [[Economic development]] has been a major concern, but poorly realized, as the good jobs once found in the local manufacturing sector have not been replaced. Pockets of [[poverty]] persist in the city, often mere blocks away from its many historical and architectural [[landmark]]s. In addition to this, the city has been facing issues regarding [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], like many other cities across the United States, ranging from overcrowded apartment buildings to mild racial conflict.\n\nIn spite of this Newburgh is experiencing a spurt of new businesses on its historic Liberty Street near Washington's Headquarters. An art supply store, a gourmet food market, an antiques store, a used furniture shop, a souvenir shop, a flower shop, a bakery and a restaurant have joined an existing caf\u00e9, a graphic design shop and two additional antiques stores in the final months of 2008 and January 2009. This is all in the midst of the redevelopment of East Parmenter Street in a partnership with [[Habitat for Humanity]] and a private developer to build 24 new houses. The city has completed the overhaul of the infrastructure of the street.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Newburgh from the bridge.jpg|thumb|View of Newburgh from the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]], 2006|alt=A city on a slope over a body of water with larger buildings at the left and center right.

It is located within [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] bordering the [[Hudson River]] on the west bank. The town of [[Newburgh, New York (town)|Newburgh]] borders the city to the north and west, and the town of [[New Windsor, New York|New Windsor]] borders the south.\n\nAdjacent to Newburgh, the land rises at first sharply to a bluff, where many historic structures are located due to the sweeping views it offers on the [[Hudson Highlands]] to the south; [[Beacon Mountain|Mount Beacon]] to the east and the [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge|Newburgh\u2014Beacon Bridge]] to the north; then more gradually to a relatively level western half. There are some notable hills in outlying areas such as the Washington Heights section in southeast Newburgh and Mount St. Mary's at the northeast.

The movement to stop it led to the development of [[Montgomery\u2013Grand\u2013Liberty Streets Historic District|a historic district]], now the second largest in New York State. The church was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] three years later, and in 2001 became the city's second [[National Historic Landmark]] after Washington's Headquarters.\n\nThe city was designated a Preserve America community in 2005 and it also signed an agreement with the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Office of Historic Preservation]] as a Certified Local Government community.

In 1966 Father John Filippelli of the [[Society of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart]] initiated a Spanish Mass as well as cultural celebrations such as the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Three Kings]]. In 1973, Fr. Rogelio Cuesta, OP was named Director of the Hispanic Apostolate of Newburgh and Beacon. Other patronal feasts were celebrated such as Our Lady of Charity from Cuba, Se\u00f1or de los Milagros of Peru, and Our Lady of Suyapa of Honduras, reflecting the diversity of the community.

Rev. Michael J. Phelan was appointed pastor, and said his first mass in the parish on Easter Sunday, 1875, in the opera-house. The Wilson property at Gidney Avenue and South Street was purchased and mass celebrated in the mansion on the premises. In May following a temporary frame building for church purposes was erected. In 1880 the building occupied by the church until 2015 was erected.  It was dedicated by Archbishop McCloskey on Sunday, October 3.

The people of the parish, and of the Newburgh community as a whole, rose up in protest and the Archdiocese withdrew the proposal. Then, in the summer of 2015, the archdiocese proposed closing the parish yet again, and while the community protests eclipsed those of 2005, this time the proposal was carried through. St. Mary's Parish was merged with St. Patrick's effective August 1, 2015. The church building was shuttered and closed and has not been used since that date. Father William Scafidi, the pastor and arguably the most popular community leader in Newburgh at that time, was transferred by the Archdiocese to a parish church in [[Liberty, New York]].\n\n==== St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church ====\nIn December 1908, Father Francis Fabian, pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish in Rondout visited Newburgh. Seeing that there the city had only two churches serving a large Catholic population, Fr. Fabian began to look into establishing another parish. Meetings were held and funds were raised and on April 22, 1909, Archbishop [[John Murphy Farley|John Farley]] of New York appointed Fr Fabian pastor of the new congregation. Land was purchased at Benkard Avenue and Avoca Street and by May a temporary chapel was started.<ref name=\"Lafort\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA399 Lafort, Remigius.

The bricks were donated by nearby brickyards and transported from the different yards to the dock in Newburgh free of charge. Gustave Fettweise donated a bell. The church was completed on August 15, 1909, and a rectory completed that same year. The parish grew so rapidly that two-year later excavation was begun for a new stone church on a hill east of the rectory. Services were continued in the old chapel until September 1, 1913 when the new church was dedicated. The interior has beautiful Bavarian stained glass windows and a large mural behind the altar that was painted in Bavaria. The Tracker organ was built in 1862. It has 2600 pipes and two keyboards.

John B. Gallo came to Newburgh to minister to the spiritual needs of the Italian-speaking people who had been attending Mass at St. Patrick's Church. The parish became separate from St. Patrick's on September 8, 1912. Land was purchased on the southeast corner of Robinson Avenue and Ann Street. A temporary chapel situated in a vacant store at 286 Washington Street was used until the church was completed. The first Mass was celebrated in the new church on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1913.{{sfn|LaFort p.419}} Rev. Cyrus Falco was the pastor who guided the parish through the trying years of the Great Depression. In 1933 he invited the Sisters of St. Dominic to take charge of our parish Sunday School. Rev. John B. Caldarola was pastor during World War II.<ref name=\"shcn\">[http://sacredheartnewburgh.org/history \"Our History\", Sacred Heart Catholic Church]</ref>\n\nRev. Salvatore Celauro became pastor in 1947. The groundbreaking ceremony for the parish school was held on April 23, 1950 and school opened on September 9, 1951. In the mid-1950s it became apparent that a new church was needed as repairs would not be cost-effective. Work began in May 1963 and the first Mass in the new church was said on Christmas Eve, 1964. In September 1967 Rev. Salvatore Cantatore was named pastor of Sacred Heart and in October 1978, opened the Sacred Heart Parish Center. Msgr. George J. Valastro became pastor in 1981 and saw the parish celebrate its o75th Anniversary in 1987. Msgr. Valastro purchased the building at 319 Broadway which became the Activity Center.<ref name=\"shcn\" />\n\n==Economy==\nNewburgh was once a major economic hub between New York City and the New York State capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Partly due to [[suburbanization]] and other economic factors the city suffered an economic decline from the 1960s to first quarter of the 21st century. Currently over 11,400 residents are employed within the city limits.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe largest industries as of 2020 were [[retail]], [[Health care in the United States|healthcare]] and social assistance, [[Foodservice|food services]], [[finance]], [[public administration]], and [[For-profit education|educational services]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://datausa.io/profile/geo/newburgh-ny|title=Newburgh, NY {{!}} Data USA|website=datausa.io |access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Being in close proximity to other major [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] cities, it serves as a significant location for [[Stop & Shop]], [[M&T Bank]], [[Chase Bank]], [[Verizon Communications]], [[Charter Communications]], [[Dunkin' Donuts|Dunkin']], [[McDonald's]], [[Metro by T-Mobile]], [[Boost Mobile]], and [[Marshalls]]. The city's economy is also stimulated by several hospitals and educational institutions including the [[Veterans Health Administration|VA Hudson Valley Heathcare System]], the [[Newburgh Enlarged City School District]], and [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Media ==\nNewburgh is within the [[media market]] of New York City and [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]]. It is served by ''[[Times Herald-Record|The Times Herald-Record]]'', ''The Hudson Valley Press'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[El Diario La Prensa]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'', and other newspapers local to the area.

This ultimately led to a major reorganization of the school system. Newburgh is served by the [[Newburgh Enlarged City School District]].<ref>[http://www.newburghschools.org/newburgh/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716004100/http://www.newburghschools.org/newburgh/index.html |date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe local high school is called [[Newburgh Free Academy]], and its the largest public high school in Orange County. It serves approximately 3,000 students in grades 9\u201312 from the Newburgh area. Newburgh Free Academy is currently split into three campuses, with NFA Main located on Fullerton Avenue, NFA North located on Robinson Avenue a few blocks away, and NFA West located on West Street. Between the three campuses, there are roughly over 4,300 students enrolled. Two colleges are located in Newburgh, [[Mount Saint Mary College]] and the Newburgh campus of [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n=== Police ===\nNewburgh's early police department consisted of twenty-two officers. On April 6, 1869 the Newburgh Police Department was authorized with regulations by the Common Council Ordinance. The first headquarters of the department was on First Street between Montgomery and Smith Street. Its current headquarters is located in the Newburgh City Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/police/pages/history|title=History {{!}} Newburgh NY|website=www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Fire ===\nThe city of Newburgh is protected by the firefighters of the City of Newburgh Fire Department which operates out of two citywide firehouses. The department runs a frontline apparatus fleet of four engine companies (including two reserve engines), two ladder companies (including one reserve ladder), one fire boat, one fire alarm truck, and seven support units. It also houses and runs one of the Orange County Technical Rescue trailers as well as a foam trailer as part of the NYS Foam Task Force.\n\nNewburgh's fire department is one of the oldest chartered departments in New York State being established by an act of the young state legislature on March 24, 1797. The earliest Newburgh fire companies were the Protection Engine Company, Cataract Engine Co., Washington Engine Co., and Empire Hook & Ladder. More appeared as neighborhoods expanded. The department purchased its first steam engine in 1872. In its inaugural test, the engine threw a stream of water over the top of the cross of St. Patrick's Church, 161 feet high, to the delight of the citizens watching. The first firefighter to die in the line of duty, Joseph Tillotson, burned to death in a fire at The Bleachery on Lake Street in 1887. In March 1889, the city purchased and installed a modern electric telegraph fire alarm system with 23 alarm boxes placed around the city, these boxes are still in service today. As horses were phased out of service, Ringgold Hose on Colden Street was the first of Newburgh's companies to get a motorized fire truck in 1907. As early as 1915, editorials were calling for the establishment of a paid fire department to assure the response necessary for a densely populated and heavily commercial and industrial city like Newburgh. Beginning with drivers, tillermen and then officers, paid positions for full-time firemen were gradually created for each company. In 1934, the volunteer companies disbanded, and a professional department was instituted by resolution of the City Council. Protection has a cost. Eight men have perished in the line of duty during the department's history: Joseph Tillotson, Willis Meginn, James Hunter, Moses Embler, Armand Santacroce, Edward Maney, Frederick Carpenter and Patrick Bardin.<ref name=\"Newburgh Fire History\">[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211144153/http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nNewburgh was ranked more dangerous than 95 percent of US cities by website ''[[NeighborhoodScout]]'', based on 2012 FBI crime data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/newburgh/crime/ |title=Newburgh NY crime rates and statistics |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> This group also ranked Newburgh as the 10th most dangerous place to live in the United States based on the same 2012 dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2013/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2013 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> It was ranked at number 12 in the previous year's rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2012/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2012 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, ''The New York Times'' wrote an extensive article on gang activity in Newburgh.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/nyregion/12newburgh.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=In Newburgh, Gangs and Violence Reign|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Newburgh began implementing a program called \"Group Violence Intervention,\" an example of focused deterrence.<ref>https://nnscommunities.org/impact/city/newburgh</ref> In 2017, Newburgh reported the lowest crime rates in 10 years.<ref>http://www.recordonline.com/news/20180123/newburgh-crime-rates-lowest-in-over-10-years</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Broadway, Newburgh NY.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Broadway, 2006]]\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please note that vandalism of this page will not be tolerated; this includes unregistered IP addresses.\nVandalism includes adding of your own views, deleting large sections of text, and inserting manifestly false information.

Allegations of [[electoral fraud]] had dogged the city's first African American woman mayor, Audrey Carey, since her 1991 victory in a four-way race. Supporters of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Regina Angelo alleged that many registered voters in neighborhoods Carey had carried heavily used false addresses. In response, four years later deputy [[sheriff]]s were stationed at polling places and challenged voters to provide proof of residency and identity. Although she won, Carey's supporters claimed that the deputy sheriffs had singled out minority voters for such challenges, and accused the Republicans of [[voter suppression]]. These tensions were only aggravated when the council selected the city's Republican chairman at the time, Harry Porr, as the new city manager. Carey was defeated by Tyrone Crabb, a black man running on the Republican line, in 1999. Porr was fired, rehired and fired again in 2001. Crabb died suddenly of a heart attack ten days before he was slated to take office. The vacancy was filled by his widow, Mary.\n\nDespite demographics and urban trends favoring [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the voters of the city had until recent years regularly voted across party lines. Nicholas Valentine, mayor from 2003 until 2011 and several other recent mayors and council members were Republicans. The late [[Thomas Kirwan]]\u2014a resident who served in the [[New York State Assembly]] until 2008\u2014and was re-elected in a successful comeback bid in 2010, by one of the smallest margins in state history (15 votes), was a Republican. He died late in 2011. On March 20, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in which former Assemblyman [[Frank Skartados]], Democrat, won by a large margin. In the general election held in November 2011, a newcomer to the city named Judith Kennedy was overwhelmingly elected Mayor over incumbent Republican Councilwoman Christine Bello. In addition, the Democratic candidates for Council seats, Gay Lee and Cedric Brown, were also overwhelmingly elected. Accordingly, the council is now 5-0 Democrat\u2014the first time in recorded history one party monopolizes the Newburgh city government.\n\nAn independent documentary was made in 2004 about the mayoral race in Newburgh, called ''[[Saving Newburgh]]''.\n\nIn 2009, the Republican party did not field its own candidates for city council. Instead the Republican Committee endorsed two Democrats\u2014one a former councilman, the other an incumbent councilwoman\u2014and they were not opposed for the Republican nomination in the primary despite their being registered Democrats. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] and [[Independence Party of New York|Independence]] parties both nominated them also.

Recent albums, beginning with ''[[Khronos (Rotting Christ album)|Khronos]]'', have shown the band taking a more modern, faster and more aggressive approach to their [[black metal|blackened]]-[[gothic metal|gothic]] style.

Afterwards, they were informed by their lawyers that the two were included in a \"list of unwanted people for reasons of national security\" that labeled them as \"Satanists\" and \"suspects of terrorism\".  The two were eventually released, after arrangements made by the band's other members in collaboration with the local promoter, \"who involved legal experts, journalists and activists in Georgia\".  The band was allowed to perform their scheduled concert and left for their next destination, Armenia, without hassle.\n\n== Musical style ==\nEarly in their career, they were responsible for creating what is known as the \"classic\" Greek black metal sound which can be heard in other bands such as Varathron and Thou Art Lord. Despite the name, the band's traditional lyrical themes involving [[evil]] and [[occultism]] has evolved into a more \"mystic\" path,<ref name=rusmetal.ru/> and they have modified their musical direction on each album, utilizing elements such as clean melodic [[baritone]] vocals, [[doom metal|doom]], [[gothic metal]] and [[industrial music]] traits, and male/female [[Benedictine]] chants. Recent albums, beginning with ''[[Khronos (Rotting Christ album)|Khronos]]'', have shown the band taking a more modern, faster and more aggressive approach to their [[black metal|blackened]]-[[gothic metal|gothic]] style. Their 2007 album, ''Theogonia'', especially, has been described as more \"atmospheric\" and \"epic\" by their label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phonopaca.com/en/members/season_of_mist/season.htm|title=Phonopaca : Accueil|publisher=|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe group's choice of producers, engineers and mixers has also been varied;

Amy works for [[Jon Favreau]], and they are filming in New York. She has been eager to meet Christopher and read his screenplay; as she says, mob-themed stories are a hit. She is also struck by Christopher as a man. At home, Adriana tells Chris she has kept a copy of the screenplay he threw away, and persuades him to pass it to Jon and Amy. Both Chris and Adriana have been invited to the film set, but he goes alone. He is absorbed by what he sees, and makes a suggestion Jon gratefully adopts.\n\nJon wants to learn from Chris about mob customs and speech. When Chris comes as arranged to his hotel room he is not available, so he calls on Amy instead. They talk, she begins to give him advice about writing a screenplay, and they have sex. Another day, he manages to catch her in the hotel lobby and they go to her room again for sex, but afterwards she is overcome by guilt. In her room Chris finds a screenplay by Jon and sees that he has stolen a mob anecdote that Chris told him in confidence. Furious, Chris searches for him, but he has returned to California. In the following days, Amy does not reply to his messages. He finally tracks her down. She tells him, \"It was wrong, with us,\" and that, for the time being, [[Hollywood]] has lost interest in mob films. She turns her back on him. \n\n[[Anthony Soprano, Jr.|A.J.]] takes [[Carmela Soprano|his mother]]'s car without permission and damages it. When his parents rebuke him he baffles them by stating that life is absurd, and he does not wish to be  [[confirmation|confirmed]] because there is no God. [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] consults [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Pussy]], who is A.J.'s [[Godparent|godfather]] and confirmation sponsor; Pussy says that at that age \"they get broody.\" Tony consults [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]], who explains that A.J. has discovered [[existentialist|existentialism]]. A.J. consults [[Livia Soprano|his grandmother]] who tells him not to expect happiness; everyone dies alone; \"It's all a big nothing.\"\n\nPussy is forced by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]] at A.J.'s confirmation and the ensuing reception at the Soprano home. During the reception, Tony discovers A.J. and two friends smoking [[marijuana]] in the garage.

Amy works for [[Jon Favreau]], and they are filming in New York. She has been eager to meet Christopher and read his screenplay; as she says, mob-themed stories are a hit. She is also struck by Christopher as a man. At home, Adriana tells Chris she has kept a copy of the screenplay he threw away, and persuades him to pass it to Jon and Amy. Both Chris and Adriana have been invited to the film set, but he goes alone. He is absorbed by what he sees, and makes a suggestion Jon gratefully adopts.\n\nJon wants to learn from Chris about mob customs and speech. When Chris comes as arranged to his hotel room he is not available, so he calls on Amy instead. They talk, she begins to give him advice about writing a screenplay, and they have sex. Another day, he manages to catch her in the hotel lobby and they go to her room again for sex, but afterwards she is overcome by guilt. In her room Chris finds a screenplay by Jon and sees that he has stolen a mob anecdote that Chris told him in confidence. Furious, Chris searches for him, but he has returned to California. In the following days, Amy does not reply to his messages. He finally tracks her down. She tells him, \"It was wrong, with us,\" and that, for the time being, [[Hollywood]] has lost interest in mob films. She turns her back on him. \n\n[[Anthony Soprano, Jr.|A.J.]] takes [[Carmela Soprano|his mother]]'s car without permission and damages it. When his parents rebuke him he baffles them by stating that life is absurd, and he does not wish to be  [[confirmation|confirmed]] because there is no God. [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] consults [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Pussy]], who is A.J.'s [[Godparent|godfather]] and confirmation sponsor; Pussy says that at that age \"they get broody.\" Tony consults [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]], who explains that A.J. has discovered [[existentialist|existentialism]]. A.J. consults [[Livia Soprano|his grandmother]] who tells him not to expect happiness; everyone dies alone; \"It's all a big nothing.\"\n\nPussy is forced by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]] at A.J.'s confirmation and the ensuing reception at the Soprano home. During the reception, Tony discovers A.J. and two friends smoking [[marijuana]] in the garage. Pussy goes up to A.J.'s room, where he is sulking, and gently tells him that his father is a good man; A.J. is young and should enjoy life. He hugs him and sends him back down to the party, but Pussy himself goes into the toilet and sobs.    \n\nAdriana has inadvertently told Tony about the screenplay-writing.

The top of head and neck are olive, with a yellow eye-ring surrounding a black-brown to olive-brown eye. Cheeks and ear coverts are yellow-olive, with the rear coverts tipped black, creating a short black stripe along the anterior edge of the neck plume. The chin and throat are dull yellowish-olive.\n\nThe upperparts are uniform grey-olive and the uppertail coverts have a yellowish tinge.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> Upperwing coverts are mostly brown with olive to yellow-olive tips or edges, creating a somewhat scalloped appearance. Remiges are dark brown with yellowish edges to secondaries, forming a yellow-olive panel when the wing is folded. Uppertail is olive-brown with yellow-olive outer edges. Underbody is mainly light brown-grey, with pale yellow streaks in the centre of the breast, pale yellow on the upper belly, flanks and undertail coverts, and cream on the lower belly. Underwing coverts are off-white with brown-grey remiges. Undertail is brownish grey.\n\nThe feet and legs are pinkish to purplish grey.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> During breeding season, the bill and gape are black; however, outside of breeding the bill obtains an orange-yellow or orange-brown base (only on the lower mandible in some individuals) with a yellow gape.\n\nFour [[subspecies]] are recognised: ''penicillatus'', ''leilavalensis'', ''carteri'' and ''calconi''.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> ''P. p. leilavalensis'' is paler and yellower, ''carteri'' is strongly tinged yellow, and ''calconi'' yellower. These subspecies intergrade where ranges overlap.\nIn all four races, males are slightly larger than females. ''P. p. penicillatus'' is the largest, with males averaging 20.5 g and females 18.1 g. ''P. p. leilavalensis'' and ''P. p. carteri'' are similar in size, where males are around 18 g and females 16 g. ''P. p. calconi'' is the smallest, with males around 17.5 g and females around 16 g. Wing lengths are much larger in ''penicillatus'', and bill lengths differ only slightly, with the bill of  ''P. p. carteri'' being somewhat longer than the other three subspecies.\n\nJuveniles are similar to adults, but with duller colours on the top of head and neck, and brighter colours on the eye-ring and ear coverts.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> The plume is shorter and less distinct, often lacking the black border of the ear coverts. Underbody is slightly more brown. The bill is pink or yellowish with a brown tip in young individuals, changing to black with a yellow-orange or pinkish base; while the gape is yellow and noticeably puffy looking. In newly fledged birds, the feet and legs are a paler pinkish-brown and appear swollen compared to the adult.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n\nThe species is widely distributed throughout south-eastern Australia (excluding Tasmania), up towards central Australia with patches occurring in central and western Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> They are absent from desert areas but can persist in arid regions where trees and especially standing water are present.\n\nNominate race, ''P. p. penicillatus'', occurs throughout south-eastern Australia to the Spencer Gulf in South Australia, and throughout the [[Murray-Darling basin]].<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> ''P. p. leilavalensis'' is found from [[Lake Eyre]] south to the [[Flinders Ranges]] in South Australia, east to the [[Barrier Ranges]] in western New South Wales, west to the edges of the [[Gibson desert|Gibson]] and [[Great Sandy Desert|Great Sandy]] Deserts, and north to central-western Queensland.

The female appears to be responsible for construction, but both sexes maintain and make repairs. Nests are usually located among the foliage in crowns of trees or shrubs, and only rarely seen in mistletoe. Sometimes nests are constructed in forks or on branches, and rarely in dead foliage. There is some evidence of site fidelity, and nest trees may be shared with active nests maintained by several other species, including [[Willie wagtail|wagtails]], [[magpie-lark]], [[dusky woodswallow|woodswallows]], and other honeyeater species.\n\nMales undertake a song flight display, with a slight climbing and undulating flight above treetops while singing.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> At the song's completion, the male dives quickly into a nearby tree. This is performed throughout the day during breeding season, but less commonly in the early morning. Playback of this song does not induce territorial responses, suggesting the display is sexual in function. Other songs heard commonly after the breeding period begins may also have courtship functions.\n\nThe clutch is usually 2\u20133 eggs, varying from 1\u20134 overall.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> The second egg is typically laid within 24 hours of the first. Eggs are approximately 20 x 15&nbsp;cm, weighing 2.45g; oval, smooth, finely grained, and may be slightly glossy. Colour varies from white to yellowish, light red or pink. Markings may vary from uniform reddish freckles to purplish or dark reddish-brown spots. Marks are sometimes in greater frequency at the large end. Eggs laid late in season tend to be lighter, and those from inland populations tend to be white with fewer markings.\n\nDetails about incubation duties are unknown, although they are thought to be performed only by the female. Eggs are incubated for 10\u201314 days before hatching. Both sexes feed offspring with females brooding, leaving only when the male arrives to feed chicks. Both parents remove faecal sacs and eggshell fragments. Parents undertake distraction displays when predators approach nests, mainly in the final days before nestlings fledge. Fledging occurs 12\u201313 days after hatching and juveniles are fed for two or more weeks after leaving nest.\n\nWhite-plumed honeyeaters are parasitised by [[Pallid cuckoo|pallid]] and [[Fan-tailed cuckoo|fan-tailed]] cuckoos, as well as [[Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo|Horsfield's]]  and [[Shining bronze-cuckoo|shining]] bronze-cuckoos.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" />\n\n==Conservation status==\n\nThe white-plumed honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\n\n===Threats===\n\nExotic vertebrate predators, such as cats and dogs, are a direct threat to white-plumed honeyeater populations.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" />\nLoss of trees from watercourses will impact a population; however, they are able to adapt to suburban environments, especially where native gardens are present.\n\n===Climate effects===\n\nThe white-plumed honeyeater body-size has been observed to change over recent decades, with individuals becoming smaller in extended drought, but showing an overall trend towards larger body-size since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L. |last2=Amano |first2=Tatsuya |last3=Mackey|first3=Brendan G.|last4=Sutherland|first4=William J. |last5=Clayton |first5=Mark |last6=Peters |first6=Anne |title=Dynamic size responses to climate change: prevailing effects of rising temperature drive long-term body size increases in a semi-arid passerine|journal=Global Change Biology|date=2014|volume=2|issue=7|pages=2062\u20132075|doi=10.1111/gcb.12507}}</ref> This is correlated with increasing temperatures in the regions surveyed, with body size increasing by 0.064% per year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Amano|first2=Tatsuya|last3=Backwell|first3=Patrica R.Y. |last4=Ikin |first4=Karen |last5=Sutherland |first5=William J.|last6=Peters|first6=Anne|title=Temporal patterns of avian body size reflect linear size responses to broadscale environmental change over the last 50 years|journal=Journal of Avian Biology|date=2014|volume=45|issue=6|pages=529\u2013535 |doi=10.1111/jav.00431}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Commons|Lichenostomus penicillatus}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Ptilotula-penicillata White plumed honeyeater sound recordings at Xeno Canto] \n*[http://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:a98f7d77-5d5b-48a0-a38f-a4ceaadb5d89 Distribution information at Atlas of Living Australia]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q27075261}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:honeyeater, white-plumed}}\n[[Category:Ptilotula|white-plumed honeyeater]]\n[[Category:Endemic birds of Australia]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1837|white-plumed honeyeater]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{speciesbox\n| name = White-plumed honeyeater\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=\"IUCN\">{{cite iucn | authors = [[BirdLife International]] | title = Ptilotula penicillata | volume = 2016 | page = e.T22704097A93952831 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-3.RLTS.T22704097A93952831.en }}</ref>\n| image = Ptilotula penicillata - Glen Davis.jpg\n| image_caption = At Glen Davis, New South Wales\n| image2 = Ptilotula penicillata - White-plumed Honeyeater XC492296.mp3\n| image2_caption = Recorded at Cooya Pooya, Western Australia\n| genus = Ptilotula\n| species = penicillata\n| authority = ([[John Gould|Gould]], 1837)\n| synonyms = ''Lichenostomus penicillatus''\n| range_map = WPHE distribution.png\n| range_map_caption = Distribution\n}}\n\nThe '''white-plumed honeyeater''' (''Ptilotula penicillata'', formerly ''Lichenostomus penicillatus''<ref name=\"IOC\">{{cite web|title=IOC Version 3.5 (Sept 30, 2013)|url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/updates/archive-3-1-to-3-5/taxonomy-3-1-3-5/|website=IOC World Bird List|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>) is a small [[passerine]] bird endemic to [[Australia]].

The top of head and neck are olive, with a yellow eye-ring surrounding a black-brown to olive-brown eye. Cheeks and ear coverts are yellow-olive, with the rear coverts tipped black, creating a short black stripe along the anterior edge of the neck plume.

Remiges are dark brown with yellowish edges to secondaries, forming a yellow-olive panel when the wing is folded. Uppertail is olive-brown with yellow-olive outer edges. Underbody is mainly light brown-grey, with pale yellow streaks in the centre of the breast, pale yellow on the upper belly, flanks and undertail coverts, and cream on the lower belly. Underwing coverts are off-white with brown-grey remiges.

In newly fledged birds, the feet and legs are a paler pinkish-brown and appear swollen compared to the adult.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n\nThe species is widely distributed throughout south-eastern Australia (excluding Tasmania), up towards central Australia with patches occurring in central and western Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> They are absent from desert areas but can persist in arid regions where trees and especially standing water are present.\n\nNominate race, ''P. p. penicillatus'', occurs throughout south-eastern Australia to the Spencer Gulf in South Australia, and throughout the [[Murray-Darling basin]].<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> ''P. p. leilavalensis'' is found from [[Lake Eyre]] south to the [[Flinders Ranges]] in South Australia, east to the [[Barrier Ranges]] in western New South Wales, west to the edges of the [[Gibson desert|Gibson]] and [[Great Sandy Desert|Great Sandy]] Deserts, and north to central-western Queensland. ''P. p. carteri'' occurs in the Pilbara region of WA from [[Geraldton]] to the Fortescue Ranges, and east to the Western Deserts; while ''P. p. calconi'' is known only from the southern [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region.\n\nThe species has undergone range expansion in the last century.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /><ref name=\"Hindwood\">{{cite journal |last1=Hindwood |first1=K.A. |title=Breeding of the White-plumed honeyeater near Sydney|journal=Emu|date=1950|volume=49|issue=3|pages=211\u2013213 |doi=10.1071/MU949211}}</ref>  It was formerly linked closely to the distribution of [[river red gum]] (''Eucalyptus camaldulensis'') and a few other riverine species;<ref name=\"Gannon\">{{cite journal|last1=Gannon|first1=G.R.|title=The influence of habitat on the distribution of Australian birds.|journal=Emu|date=1965|volume=65|issue=4|pages=241\u2013253|doi=10.1071/MU965241}}</ref> but it has since expanded into coastal areas to become resident in Sydney and Newcastle, where they were previously uncommon or only seasonal visitors.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /><ref name=\"Hindwood\" /> Banding studies indicate that the species is primarily sedentary, with 99.8% of recaptures occurring less than 10&nbsp;km from the banding site.

The female appears to be responsible for construction but both sexes maintain and make repairs. Nests are usually located among the foliage in crowns of trees or shrubs, and only rarely seen in mistletoe. Sometimes nests are constructed in forks or on branches, and rarely in dead foliage. There is some evidence of site fidelity, and nest trees may be shared with active nests maintained by several other species including [[Willie wagtail|wagtails]], [[magpie-lark]], [[dusky woodswallow|woodswallows]] and other honeyeater species.\n\nMales undertake a song flight display, with a slight climbing and undulating flight above tree tops while singing.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> At the song's completion, the male dives quickly into a nearby tree. This is performed throughout the day during breeding season, but less commonly in the early morning. Playback of this song does not induce territorial responses, suggesting the display is sexual in function. Other songs heard commonly after the breeding period begins may also have courtship functions.\n\nThe clutch is usually 2\u20133 eggs, varying from 1\u20134 overall.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" /> The second egg is typically laid within 24 hours of the first. Eggs are approximately 20 x 15&nbsp;cm, weighing 2.45g; oval, smooth, finely grained and may be slightly glossy. Colour varies from white to yellowish, light red or pink. Markings may vary from uniform reddish freckles to purplish or dark reddish-brown spots. Marks are sometimes in greater frequency at the large end. Eggs laid late in season tend to be lighter, and those from inland populations tend to be white with fewer markings.\n\nDetails about incubation duties are unknown, although they are thought to be performed only by the female. Eggs are incubated for 10\u201314 days before hatching. Both sexes feed offspring with females brooding, leaving only when the male arrives to feed chicks. Both parents remove faecal sacs and eggshell fragments. Parents undertake distraction displays when predators approach nests, mainly in the final days before nestlings fledge. Fledging occurs 12\u201313 days after hatching and juveniles are fed for two or more weeks after leaving nest.\n\nWhite-plumed honeyeaters are parasitised by [[Pallid cuckoo|pallid]] and [[Fan-tailed cuckoo|fan-tailed]] cuckoos, as well as [[Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo|Horsfield's]]  and [[Shining bronze-cuckoo|shining]] bronze-cuckoos.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" />\n\n==Conservation status==\n\nThe white-plumed honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation.<ref name=\"IUCN\" />\n\n===Threats===\n\nExotic vertebrate predators, such as cats and dogs, are a direct threat to white-plumed honeyeater populations.<ref name=\"HANZAB\" />\nLoss of trees from watercourses will impact a population; however, they are able to adapt to suburban environments, especially where native gardens are present.\n\n===Climate effects===\n\nThe white-plumed honeyeater body-size has been observed to change over recent decades, with individuals becoming smaller in extended drought, but showing an overall trend towards larger body-size since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L. |last2=Amano |first2=Tatsuya |last3=Mackey|first3=Brendan G.|last4=Sutherland|first4=William J. |last5=Clayton |first5=Mark |last6=Peters |first6=Anne |title=Dynamic size responses to climate change: prevailing effects of rising temperature drive long-term body size increases in a semi-arid passerine|journal=Global Change Biology|date=2014|volume=2|issue=7|pages=2062\u20132075|doi=10.1111/gcb.12507}}</ref> This is correlated with increasing temperatures in the regions surveyed, with body size increasing by 0.064% per year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Amano|first2=Tatsuya|last3=Backwell|first3=Patrica R.Y. |last4=Ikin |first4=Karen |last5=Sutherland |first5=William J.|last6=Peters|first6=Anne|title=Temporal patterns of avian body size reflect linear size responses to broadscale environmental change over the last 50 years|journal=Journal of Avian Biology|date=2014|volume=45|issue=6|pages=529\u2013535 |doi=10.1111/jav.00431}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Commons|Lichenostomus penicillatus}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Ptilotula-penicillata White plumed honeyeater sound recordings at Xeno Canto] \n*[http://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:a98f7d77-5d5b-48a0-a38f-a4ceaadb5d89 Distribution information at Atlas of Living Australia]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q27075261}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:honeyeater, white-plumed}}\n[[Category:Ptilotula|white-plumed honeyeater]]\n[[Category:Endemic birds of Australia]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1837|white-plumed honeyeater]]\n", "name_user": "Rogermccart", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReproduction:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-plumed_honeyeater"}

The JJIF is currently the only Jujutsu/Ju-Jitsu organization recognized by the GAISF and IWGA; Ju-Jitsu under JJIF rules is a part of the [[World Games]]<ref>[http://www.kjjbwf.org/ Korea Jujitsu Belt Wrestling Federation website]</ref> and [[World Combat Games]].<ref>http://www.worldcombatgames.com/en/sports/17/Ju-Jitsu</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Federation commenced as a coalition of three countries' associations. In 1977, delegates form Germany, Italy and Sweden founded the European Ju-Jitsu Federation (EJJF). As the number of member Nations increased, in and out of Europe, in 1987 the Federation changed its name to International Ju-Jitsu Federation (IJJF) and the original European nucleus of the Federation became the first Continental Union (EJJU) of the IJJF.  Following a series of changes of its Statutes and a change to its membership structure, in 1998, the IJJF decided to change its name to the Ju-Jitsu International Federation (JJIF).<ref>[http://www.jjifweb.com/html/ju-jitsu.html What is Ju-jitsu], JJIF website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529123759/http://www.jjifweb.com/html/ju-jitsu.html |date=29 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s the IJJF became a provisional member of the [[SportAccord|General Association of International Sport Federations]] (GAISF), member of [[International World Games Association]] (IWGA \u2013 part of the Olympic Movement together with the IOC) and affiliated to the Sport for All Federation (FISpT). During the 1998 GAISF Congress the JJIF obtained full membership status.\n\nJu-Jitsu under JJIF rules has been an event at the [[World Games]] since the [[1997 World Games]] in Lahti, Finland.\n\n== Traditional Jujutsu and Sport Ju-Jitsu ==\n\nDifferent schools ([[ry\u016b (school)|ry\u016b]]) have been teaching traditional Jujutsu in Japan since the 15th century. The JJIF is not a governing body for any of these schools of traditional Japanese jujutsu\u2014the JJIF does not exercise authority over traditional Japanese Jujutsu [[Koryu]] styles, which are often instead headed by leaders who claim leadership from unbroken lineages of transmissions from different Japanese ry\u016b, some of them hundreds of years old.\n\nRather, the JJIF was founded as an international federation solely for governing Sport Ju-Jitsu, a competitive sport derived from traditional jujutsu.\n\n== Rules of Sport Ju-Jitsu ==\n\nJJIF currently regulates three different types of competitions at the international level: the ''Duo system''', ''Fighting system'' and ''Ne Waza''.<ref>The official rules can be found at the [http://www.jjif-referees.com/ JJIF-Referees website.]</ref>\n\n===Duo===\nThe former is a discipline in which a pair of Jutsukas (Ju-Jitsu athlete) from the same team show possible self-defence techniques against a series of 12 attacks, randomly called by the mat referee from the 20 codified attacks to cover the following typologies: grip attack (or strangulation), embrace attack (or necklock), hit attack (punch or kick) and armed attack (stick or knife).\n\nThe Duo system has three competition categories: male, female or mixed, and the athletes are judged for their speed, accuracy, control and realism. It is arguably the most spectacular form of Ju-jitsu competition and it requires great technical preparation, synchronicity and elevated athletic qualities.\n\n===Fighting===\nWith a different approach, the Fighting System is articulated in a one-on-one competition between athletes. The system is divided in several categories according to weight and sex\n\n(Male categories: -55&nbsp;kg, \u221262&nbsp;kg, \u221269&nbsp;kg, \u221277&nbsp;kg, \u221285&nbsp;kg, \u221294&nbsp;kg, +94&nbsp;kg; Female categories \u221248&nbsp;kg, \u221255&nbsp;kg, \u221262&nbsp;kg, \u221270&nbsp;kg, +70&nbsp;kg).\n\nThe actual competition is divided in three phases (Parts): Part I sees the jutsukas involved in distance combat (controlled attacks with arms and legs and atemis of various nature \u2013 punches, strikes and kicks). Once a grab has been made the Fight enters Part II and hits are no longer allowed.\n\nThe jutsukas try to bring one another down with various throwing techniques (and points are given according to how \"clean\" and effective the action was). Also \u2013 despite being uncommon \u2013 submission techniques as controlled strangulations and locks are allowed in part II.\n\nOnce down on the tatamis (mats) the match enters its Part III. Here points are given for immobilisation techniques, controlled strangulations or levers on body joints that bring the opponent to yield.\n\nThe winner is the Jutsuka who has accumulated most points during the fight. Automatic victory is assigned to the Jutsuka who gets an \"Ippon\" (clean action, full points) in all three Parts. This type of competition requires timing, agility, strength and endurance.\n\n===Ne-Waza===\nNe-Waza (ground technique) is one of the main Jujitsu (and Judo) bases. The fight of two opponents starts standing. Punches and kicks are not allowed. After starting the fight the referee interrupts only in critical moments, so normally the main part of the fight takes place on the ground. It is the goal to win by submission with a lock on the joints or strangulation.

The JJIF is currently the only Jujutsu/Ju-Jitsu organization recognized by the GAISF and IWGA; Ju-Jitsu under JJIF rules is a part of the [[World Games]]<ref>[http://www.kjjbwf.org/ Korea Jujitsu Belt Wrestling Federation website]</ref> and [[World Combat Games]].<ref>http://www.worldcombatgames.com/en/sports/17/Ju-Jitsu</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Federation commenced as a coalition of three countries' associations. In 1977, delegates form Germany, Italy and Sweden founded the European Ju-Jitsu Federation (EJJF). As the number of member Nations increased, in and out of Europe, in 1987 the Federation changed its name to International Ju-Jitsu Federation (IJJF) and the original European nucleus of the Federation became the first Continental Union (EJJU) of the IJJF.  Following a series of changes of its Statutes and a change to its membership structure, in 1998, the IJJF decided to change its name to the Ju-Jitsu International Federation (JJIF).<ref>[http://www.jjifweb.com/html/ju-jitsu.html What is Ju-jitsu], JJIF website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529123759/http://www.jjifweb.com/html/ju-jitsu.html |date=29 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s the IJJF became a provisional member of the [[SportAccord|General Association of International Sport Federations]] (GAISF), member of [[International World Games Association]] (IWGA \u2013 part of the Olympic Movement together with the IOC) and affiliated to the Sport for All Federation (FISpT). During the 1998 GAISF Congress the JJIF obtained full membership status.\n\nJu-Jitsu under JJIF rules has been an event at the [[World Games]] since the [[1997 World Games]] in Lahti, Finland.\n\n== Traditional Jujutsu and Sport Ju-Jitsu ==\n\nDifferent schools ([[ry\u016b (school)|ry\u016b]]) have been teaching traditional Jujutsu in Japan since the 15th century. The JJIF is not a governing body for any of these schools of traditional Japanese jujutsu\u2014the JJIF does not exercise authority over traditional Japanese Jujutsu [[Koryu]] styles, which are often instead headed by leaders who claim leadership from unbroken lineages of transmissions from different Japanese ry\u016b, some of them hundreds of years old.\n\nRather, the JJIF was founded as an international federation solely for governing Sport Ju-Jitsu, a competitive sport derived from traditional jujutsu.\n\n== Rules of Sport Ju-Jitsu ==\n\nJJIF currently regulates three different types of competitions at the international level: the ''Duo system''', ''Fighting system'' and ''Ne Waza''.<ref>The official rules can be found at the [http://www.jjif-referees.com/ JJIF-Referees website.]</ref>\n\n===Duo===\nThe former is a discipline in which a pair of Jutsukas (Ju-Jitsu athlete) from the same team show possible self-defence techniques against a series of 12 attacks, randomly called by the mat referee from the 20 codified attacks to cover the following typologies: grip attack (or strangulation), embrace attack (or necklock), hit attack (punch or kick) and armed attack (stick or knife).\n\nThe Duo system has three competition categories: male, female or mixed, and the athletes are judged for their speed, accuracy, control and realism. It is arguably the most spectacular form of Ju-jitsu competition and it requires great technical preparation, synchronicity and elevated athletic qualities.\n\n===Fighting===\nWith a different approach, the Fighting System is articulated in a one-on-one competition between athletes. The system is divided in several categories according to weight and sex\n\n(Male categories: -55&nbsp;kg, \u221262&nbsp;kg, \u221269&nbsp;kg, \u221277&nbsp;kg, \u221285&nbsp;kg, \u221294&nbsp;kg, +94&nbsp;kg; Female categories \u221248&nbsp;kg, \u221255&nbsp;kg, \u221262&nbsp;kg, \u221270&nbsp;kg, +70&nbsp;kg).\n\nThe actual competition is divided in three phases (Parts): Part I sees the jutsukas involved in distance combat (controlled attacks with arms and legs and atemis of various nature \u2013 punches, strikes and kicks). Once a grab has been made the Fight enters Part II and hits are no longer allowed.\n\nThe jutsukas try to bring one another down with various throwing techniques (and points are given according to how \"clean\" and effective the action was). Also \u2013 despite being uncommon \u2013 submission techniques as controlled strangulations and locks are allowed in part II.\n\nOnce down on the tatamis (mats) the match enters its Part III. Here points are given for immobilisation techniques, controlled strangulations or levers on body joints that bring the opponent to yield.\n\nThe winner is the Jutsuka who has accumulated most points during the fight. Automatic victory is assigned to the Jutsuka who gets an \"Ippon\" (clean action, full points) in all three Parts. This type of competition requires timing, agility, strength and endurance.\n\n===Ne-Waza===\nNe-Waza (ground technique) is one of the main Jujitsu (and Judo) bases. The fight of two opponents starts standing. Punches and kicks are not allowed. After starting the fight the referee interrupts only in critical moments, so normally the main part of the fight takes place on the ground. It is the goal to win by submission with a lock on the joints or strangulation. During the time of 6 minutes it is possible to gain points for throws, take-downs, controlling positions and actions to gain an advantage in the fight. The Ne-Waza Ju-Jitsu is extremely tactical and sometimes described as the chess game of martial arts. This ruleset is similar to [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] rules.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Weight categories in JJIF ne-waza-system\n|-\n! age !! sex !! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | weight categories\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Cadets (U17) || male || \u221255&nbsp;kg || \u221260&nbsp;kg || \u221266&nbsp;kg || \u221273&nbsp;kg || \u221281&nbsp;kg || \u221290&nbsp;kg || +90&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | female || \u221244&nbsp;kg || \u221248&nbsp;kg || \u221252&nbsp;kg || \u221257&nbsp;kg || \u221263&nbsp;kg || \u221270&nbsp;kg || +70&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Juniors (U20) <br /> Seniors || \u221248&nbsp;kg || \u221252&nbsp;kg || \u221257&nbsp;kg || \u221263&nbsp;kg || \u221270&nbsp;kg || \u221278&nbsp;kg || +78&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| male || \u221260&nbsp;kg || \u221266&nbsp;kg || \u221273&nbsp;kg || \u221281&nbsp;kg || \u221290&nbsp;kg || \u2212100&nbsp;kg || +100&nbsp;kg\n|}\n\nThe contest duration is 4 minutes for cadets, 6 minutes for juniors and seniors (<=35 years) and 5 minutes for competitors from 36 years onwards.\n\n== Sport Ju-Jitsu and the Olympic Movement ==\n\nThe JJIF is a member of [[GAISF]] and [[IWGA]], and both organizations are in close cooperation with the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

First, it responded to claims by various delegations, in particular the delegations of the Netherlands, Slovakia, Austria and Canada, in regards to its nuclear program. Iran stated its nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, and that they have always observed their legal obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It further stated that more attention should be paid to \"un-safeguarded and secretive nuclear weapons installations of the Zionist regime.\"<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\">{{UN doc |docid=A/64/PV.10 |body=A |session=64 |type=Official record |document_number=PV.10 |title=General Assembly Sixty-fourth session: 10th plenary meeting, Saturday, 26 September 2009, 3 p.m. New York |date= 26 September 2009 |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nSecondly, it responded to the United Arab Emirates regarding its territorial integrity and the sovereignty of three islands in the Persian Gulf, namely [[Bu Musa]], [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Greater Tunb]] and [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Lesser Tunb]]. These islands are claimed by the United Arab Emirates, and in their General Assembly speech called for their return. Iran, however, considers these islands to be an integral part of Iranian territory. It stated that all actions taken on these islands have been have\nbeen in exercise of its sovereign rights.<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\"/><ref>{{cite speech |last=Bin Zayed Al Nahyan |first=Abdullah |author-link=Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan |title=Statement by His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Head of Delegation, before the general debate of the 64 session of the United Nations General Assembly |event=United Nations General Assembly |date=26 September 2009 |location=New York |publisher=United Nations |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/64/64_AE_en.pdf |access-date=15 September 2019 |language=Arabic}}</ref>\n\n'''Serbia''' <br>\nThe delegation of Serbia used its right of reply to respond to statements made by the Prime Minister of the Albania, Sali Berisha. In his speech before the Assembly, the Prime Minister added his support to the independence of [[Kosovo]] from Serbia. He also urged Member States to recognize Kosovo and uphold General Assembly Resolution 49/204, which called for an end to human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, as well as the establishment of democratic institutions in Kosovo.<ref>{{cite speech |last=Berisha |first=Sali |author-link=Sali Berisha |title=Statement by H.E.

Serbia also stated that his remarks were deplorable, especially when the legality of Kosovo's secession [[Advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|was being considered]] by the [[International Court of Justice]]. Finally, Serbia stated that, contrary to Mr. Berisha's staements, inter-ethnic tensions in Kosovo have not been reduced, but rather \"frozen in uneasy expectation.\"<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\"/>\n\n'''United Arab Emirates''' <br>\nThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates used its right of reply to respond to statements made in the right of reply of the Islamic Republic of Iran. HH. Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan re-emphasized that the United Arab Emirates considers Bu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb as integral parts of Emirati territory and called upon Iran to engage in unconditional, serious and direct bilateral negotiations in order reach a final outcome of the dispute. He also suggested that, if no resolution could be found, the case be sent to the International Court of Justice for a legal opinion.<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\"/>\n\n'''Albania''' <br>\nThe delegation of Albania used its right of reply to respond to statements made in the right of reply of Serbia. Albania stated that the Republic of Kosovo was an undeniable reality, and that it would one day finally achieve its independence. While agreeing that the issue was still divisive, the delegation pointed out that the number of countries recognizing Kosovo has only increased. Finally, the delegation stated that it reserves the right to advocate for the independence of the Kosovo as a neighboring state that could be possibly affected by any conflicts over the region.<ref

First, it responded to claims by various delegations, in particular the delegations of the Netherlands, Slovakia, Austria and Canada, in regards to its nuclear program. Iran stated its nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, and that they have always observed their legal obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It further stated that more attention should be paid to \"un-safeguarded and secretive nuclear weapons installations of the Zionist regime.\"<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\">{{UN doc |docid=A/64/PV.10 |body=A |session=64 |type=Official record |document_number=PV.10 |title=General Assembly Sixty-fourth session: 10th plenary meeting, Saturday, 26 September 2009, 3 p.m. New York |date= 26 September 2009 |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nSecondly, it responded to the United Arab Emirates regarding its territorial integrity and the sovereignty of three islands in the Persian Gulf, namely [[Bu Musa]], [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Greater Tunb]] and [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Lesser Tunb]]. These islands are claimed by the United Arab Emirates, and in their General Assembly speech called for their return. Iran, however, considers these islands to be an integral part of Iranian territory. It stated that all actions taken on these islands have been have\nbeen in exercise of its sovereign rights.<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\"/><ref>{{cite speech |last=Bin Zayed Al Nahyan |first=Abdullah |author-link=Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan |title=Statement by His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Head of Delegation, before the general debate of the 64 session of the United Nations General Assembly |event=United Nations General Assembly |date=26 September 2009 |location=New York |publisher=United Nations |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/64/64_AE_en.pdf |access-date=15 September 2019 |language=Arabic}}</ref>\n\n'''Serbia''' <br>\nThe delegation of Serbia used its right of reply to respond to statements made by the Prime Minister of the Albania, Sali Berisha. In his speech before the Assembly, the Prime Minister added his support to the independence of [[Kosovo]] from Serbia. He also urged Member States to recognize Kosovo and uphold General Assembly Resolution 49/204, which called for an end to human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, as well as the establishment of democratic institutions in Kosovo.<ref>{{cite speech |last=Berisha |first=Sali |author-link=Sali Berisha |title=Statement by H.E.

Serbia also stated that his remarks were deplorable, especially when the legality of Kosovo's secession [[Advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|was being considered]] by the [[International Court of Justice]]. Finally, Serbia stated that, contrary to Mr. Berisha's staements, inter-ethnic tensions in Kosovo have not been reduced, but rather \"frozen in uneasy expectation.\"<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\"/>\n\n'''United Arab Emirates''' <br>\nThe delegation of the United Arab Emirates used its right of reply to respond to statements made in the right of reply of the Islamic Republic of Iran. HH. Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan re-emphasized that the United Arab Emirates considers Bu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb as integral parts of Emirati territory and called upon Iran to engage in unconditional, serious and direct bilateral negotiations in order reach a final outcome of the dispute. He also suggested that, if no resolution could be found, the case be sent to the International Court of Justice for a legal opinion.<ref name=\"A/64/PV.10\"/>\n\n'''Albania''' <br>\nThe delegation of Albania used its right of reply to respond to statements made in the right of reply of Serbia. Albania stated that the Republic of Kosovo was an undeniable reality, and that it would one day finally achieve its independence. While agreeing that the issue was still divisive, the delegation pointed out that the number of countries recognizing Kosovo has only increased. Finally, the delegation stated that it reserves the right to advocate for the independence of the Kosovo as a neighboring state that could be possibly affected by any conflicts over the region.<ref

[[Manufacturing|Manufactured]] by the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] from 1908 to 1948, it was [[Marketing|marketed]] as a small [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealable]] [[firearm]] which could be easily tucked into a vest pocket for unobtrusive carry. Designed by [[John Moses Browning]], the Model 1908 followed Browning\u2019s earlier European version, introduced by [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] as the '''[[FN Model 1906]]'''. Both pistols were chambered for the Browning-invented [[.25 ACP]] (Automatic Colt Pistol) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].<ref name=\"colt\">[http://coltautos.com] Colt autos website. Accessed June 6, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Features and options==\nKnown as the Model \"N\" internally within Colt, the 1908 Vest Pocket is a diminutive 4.5 inches long, and has a 2-inch barrel. Weighing a mere 13 ounces, it is fed by a six-round [[single column magazine|single column]] [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]].<ref name=\"nazarian\">[http://nazarian.no] Nazarian's Gun's Recognition Guide. Accessed June 6, 2008.</ref> The pistol\u2019s [[Iron sights#Open sights|fixed open iron]] sights were rather small and rudimentary, but typical for small hideout automatics of its era and adequate for the short range at which it was intended to be used. Colt's [[advertising]] and [[Marketing collateral|marketing literature]] of the time highly touted the advanced safety features of the Model 1908, including a standard slide-locking [[safety (firearms)|safety catch]], as well as a [[Grip safety#Grip safety|grip safety]]. In 1916 Colt [[engineer]] George Tansley invented a third safety feature for the pistol, the [[Grip safety#Magazine Interlocks|magazine safety disconnector]], which prevented accidental firing with the magazine removed. This additional safety device was added to production in 1916 or 1917 in the latter 139,000 serial number range, and [[patent]]ed by Colt in 1917. Proud of the [[state-of-the-art]] technology represented by this advance, Colt included a green [[brochure]] marking its inclusion with every Model 1908 sold for a year after its introduction. Additionally, in approximately the 280,000 serial number range, the left side [[pistol slide|slide]] inscription was altered to include the patent date for the disconnector, also known as the \u201cTansley Device\u201d.<ref name=\"colt\"/>\n\n==Finishes==\nThe \"Vest Pocket\" was mainly produced with the famous highly polished lustrous Colt [[royal blue]] finish, featuring [[Case hardening|color-casehardening]] of the safety catch, grip safety, and trigger. A second popular option was polished [[Electroless nickel plating|nickel plate]], and various specialty and customer order finishes were also available, including gold and silver plating, as well as ornate [[engraving]]. Standard [[pistol grip|grip]] materials available included black hard rubber in both square and round top configurations, and finely checked [[walnut]]. All factory grips sported a [[medallion]] emblazoned with the famous \"rampant Colt\" which was available in two differing styles. More elaborate grip options were also offered, such as Ivory (both plain and [[Ivory carving|carved]]), as well as [[Nacre|mother of pearl]].<ref name=\"colt\"/>\n\n==Production==\nIn 40 years of production a total of approximately 420,705 Model 1908 pistols were manufactured, pausing only during 1943\u20131945 due to the demands of [[World War II]] production.<ref name=\"colt\"/> An improved redesign became the [[Baby Browning]], which is still in production. The Colt Model 1908 saw limited service with American and British OSS and SOE units during [[World War II]]. Due to its nature as a small highly concealable weapon.

[[Manufacturing|Manufactured]] by the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] from 1908 to 1948, it was [[Marketing|marketed]] as a small [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealable]] [[firearm]] which could be easily tucked into a vest pocket for unobtrusive carry. Designed by [[John Moses Browning]], the Model 1908 followed Browning\u2019s earlier European version, introduced by [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] as the '''[[FN Model 1906]]'''. Both pistols were chambered for the Browning-invented [[.25 ACP]] (Automatic Colt Pistol) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].<ref name=\"colt\">[http://coltautos.com] Colt autos website. Accessed June 6, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Features and options==\nKnown as the Model \"N\" internally within Colt, the 1908 Vest Pocket is a diminutive 4.5 inches long, and has a 2-inch barrel. Weighing a mere 13 ounces, it is fed by a six-round [[single column magazine|single column]] [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]].<ref name=\"nazarian\">[http://nazarian.no] Nazarian's Gun's Recognition Guide.

Colt's [[advertising]] and [[Marketing collateral|marketing literature]] of the time highly touted the advanced safety features of the Model 1908, including a standard slide-locking [[safety (firearms)|safety catch]], as well as a [[Grip safety#Grip safety|grip safety]]. In 1916 Colt [[engineer]] George Tansley invented a third safety feature for the pistol, the [[Grip safety#Magazine Interlocks|magazine safety disconnector]], which prevented accidental firing with the magazine removed. This additional safety device was added to production in 1916 or 1917 in the latter 139,000 serial number range, and [[patent]]ed by Colt in 1917. Proud of the [[state-of-the-art]] technology represented by this advance, Colt included a green [[brochure]] marking its inclusion with every Model 1908 sold for a year after its introduction. Additionally, in approximately the 280,000 serial number range, the left side [[pistol slide|slide]] inscription was altered to include the patent date for the disconnector, also known as the \u201cTansley Device\u201d.<ref name=\"colt\"/>\n\n==Finishes==\nThe \"Vest Pocket\" was mainly produced with the famous highly polished lustrous Colt [[royal blue]] finish, featuring [[Case hardening|color-casehardening]] of the safety catch, grip safety, and trigger. A second popular option was polished [[Electroless nickel plating|nickel plate]], and various specialty and customer order finishes were also available, including gold and silver plating, as well as ornate [[engraving]]. Standard [[pistol grip|grip]] materials available included black hard rubber in both square and round top configurations, and finely checked [[walnut]]. All factory grips sported a [[medallion]] emblazoned with the famous \"rampant Colt\" which was available in two differing styles. More elaborate grip options were also offered, such as Ivory (both plain and [[Ivory carving|carved]]), as well as [[Nacre|mother of pearl]].<ref name=\"colt\"/>\n\n==Production==\nIn 40 years of production a total of approximately 420,705 Model 1908 pistols were manufactured, pausing only during 1943\u20131945 due to the demands of [[World War II]] production.<ref name=\"colt\"/> An improved redesign became the [[Baby Browning]], which is still in production. The Colt Model 1908 saw limited service with American and British OSS and SOE units during [[World War II]]. Due to its nature as a small highly concealable weapon. Due to this association, unscrupulous dealers have been known to stamp 1908\u2019s with \u201cUS Property\u201d or the flaming ordinance bomb or some variation there of.

It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

a [[light rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is owned and operated by [[TriMet]]. It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

He was also known for his efforts to disprove the [[Documentary Hypothesis]], as expressed by the [[Julius Wellhausen|Graf-Wellhausen]] theory, with his arguments presented in the work ''Die wichtigsten Instanzen gegen die Graf-Wellhausensche Hypothese'' (1903/1916).  [[A.

The uniqueness of this 80 years old musical extravaganza is that celebrated Indian classical musicians, irrespective of their religion, from both genres \u2013 Carnatic and Hindustani \u2013 descend down to offer their musical rendition to Lord Sri Rama and the assembled audience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ramanavami.org/about-us|title=Sree Ramaseva Mandali, Retrospect &#124; Our Impact|website=www.ramanavami.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of Bhadrachalam Gopuram.JPG|thumb|Bhadrachalam temple in [[Telangana]] is one of the major Rama Navami celebration sites.<ref name=dna8apr2014/>]]\nIn eastern Indian states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, the Jagannath temples and regional Vaishnava community observe Rama Navami, and treat it as the day when preparations begin for their annual Jagannath [[Ratha Yatra]] in summer.<ref>[http://odishasuntimes.com/2016/01/24/logs-for-trinitys-chariots-arrive-in-odishas-puri-town/ Logs for Trinity\u2019s chariots arrive in Odisha\u2019s Puri town], Odisha Sun Times (24 January 2016)</ref><ref>[http://thehitavada.com/Encyc/2016/4/15/All-set-for-grand-Ram-Navami-Shobhayatra.aspx All set for grand Ram Navami Shobhayatra], The Hitavada (15 Apr 2016)</ref>\n\nDevotees associated with [[ISKCON]] fast through the daylight hours.<ref name=\"Melton2011p739\"/> A number of ISKCON temples introduced a more prominent celebration of the occasion of the holiday with the view of addressing needs of growing native [[Hindu]] congregation.

The descendants of Indian [[indentured servants]]/slaves who were forced to leave India by engineering a famine in these places by the then British rule, and then promised for job were shipped to colonial [[South Africa]] before 1910 to work in British owned plantations and mines, thereafter lived through the South African [[Apartheid]] regime, continued to celebrate Ram Navami by reciting ''Ramayana'', and by singing [[bhajan]]s of [[Tyagaraja]] and [[Kancherla Gopanna|Bhadrachala Ramdas]]. The tradition continues in contemporary times in the Hindu temples of [[Durban]] every year.<ref>Paula Richman (2008), ''Ways of Celebrating Ram's Birth: Ramayana Week in Durban, South Africa'', Religions Of South Asia, Volume 2 Issue 2, pages 109\u2013133</ref>\n\nSimilarly in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]], other [[Caribbean]] countries, [[Mauritius]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and many other countries Hindu descendants of colonial era indentured workers/slaves forced by the British government from India have continued to observe Ram Navami along with their other traditional festivals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven Vertovec|title=Hindu Trinidad: Religion, Ethnicity and Socio-Economic Change |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1gYAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Macmillan Academic |isbn=978-0-333-53505-9|page=211}}</ref>\n\nIt is also celebrated by Hindus in [[Fiji]], and those Fiji Hindus who have re-migrated elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian A.

Conscious again, though heavily medicated with morphine, he asks to see [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] and [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie]]. He tells them he went to [[Hell]] and saw [[Brendan Filone]] and [[Mikey Palmice]]; he also saw his father, who gets killed again every night. He reports that Filone and Palmice had a message for Tony and Paulie: \"Three o'clock.\"\n\nTony comforts him, assuring him it was only a dream. Discussing Chris' experience with [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]], Tony says he does not think he or Chris will go to Hell. He explains: \"Everybody involved knows the stakes and . . . you gotta do certain things. It's business. We're soldiers.\"\n\nPaulie, however, is deeply disturbed. He tries to persuade Chris it was only [[Purgatory]], not Hell, but still has nightmares about it. On his girlfriend's advice he seeks the help of a [[psychic]], but the psychic appears to have a terrifying knowledge of Paulie's past, including the name of the first man he ever killed, thirty years ago. Paulie then complains to his priest that all the donations he has made over the years should have given him immunity; he will never donate any more.\n\n[[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Pussy]] has a bad-tempered meeting with [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Skip Lipari|Skip Lipari]]. He tells him nothing, but repeats his fear that Tony suspects him. Then he is lucky: an informer on the street tells him where [[Matthew Bevilaqua|Matt Bevilaqua]] is hiding. He and Tony go together to the place. Tony questions Matt and establishes that [[Richie Aprile|Richie]] had no part in the attempt to kill Christopher, then shoots him. He glances at Pussy, who shoots him too, and they empty their guns into the lifeless body. They have dinner in a familiar restaurant, and talk nostalgically of old times. \n\nWhile Chris is near death, [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] finds an empty hospital room with a [[crucifix]] and prays for him. When he is conscious, she tells him he has been given a second chance; but as they speak she realizes Tony has lied to her: he told her Chris dreamed of going to Heaven.\n\nThe women are gossiping about an associate of the Sopranos whose long-term ''[[Mistress (lover)|com\u00e0re]]'' has had his child. Dreading the shame if such a thing happened to her own family, Carmela asks Tony to have a [[vasectomy]]. He vigorously refuses, and when he assures her that he has had his girlfriend tested for AIDS she leaves the marital bed in revulsion. Later, having reconsidered, he tells her he will consent, but to his bafflement she has now changed her mind. She says, \"All I want is you. That's all I have ever wanted,\" and makes passionate love to him.\n\n==First appearance==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - friends and family#Joanne Blundetto Moltisanti|Joanne Moltisanti]]''': the widow of [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Richard .22Dickie.22 Moltisanti|Richard Moltisanti]] and Christopher Moltisanti's mother.
