Tamarind heartwood is reddish brown, sometimes with a purplish hue. The heartwood in tamarind tends to be narrow and is usually only present in older and larger trees. The pale yellow sapwood is sharply demarcated from the heartwood. Heartwood is said to be durable to very durable in decay resistance, and is also resistant to insects. Its sapwood is not durable and is prone to attack by insects and fungi as well as [[spalting]]. Due to its density and interlocked grain, tamarind is considered difficult to work. Heartwood has a pronounced blunting effect on cutting edges. Tamarind turns, glues, and finishes well. The heartwood is able to take a high natural polish.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tamarind| url=http://www.wood-database.com/tamarind/| website=The Wood Database| accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Metal polish===\nIn homes and temples, especially in [[Buddhist]] Asian countries, the fruit pulp is used to polish brass shrine statues and lamps, and copper, brass, and bronze utensils.

Tamarind heartwood is reddish brown, sometimes with a purplish hue. The heartwood in tamarind tends to be narrow and is usually only present in older and larger trees. The pale yellow sapwood is sharply demarcated from the heartwood. Heartwood is said to be durable to very durable in decay resistance, and is also resistant to insects. Its sapwood is not durable and is prone to attack by insects and fungi as well as [[spalting]]. Due to its density and interlocked grain, tamarind is considered difficult to work. Heartwood has a pronounced blunting effect on cutting edges. Tamarind turns, glues, and finishes well. The heartwood is able to take a high natural polish.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tamarind| url=http://www.wood-database.com/tamarind/| website=The Wood Database| accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Metal polish===\nIn homes and temples, especially in [[Buddhist]] Asian countries, the fruit pulp is used to polish brass shrine statues and lamps, and copper, brass, and bronze utensils. The copper alone or in brass reacts with moist carbon dioxide to gain a green coat of copper carbonate. Tamarind contains [[tartaric acid]], a weak acid that can remove the coat of copper carbonate. Hence, tarnished copper utensils are cleaned with tamarind or lime, another acidic fruit.<ref name=Morton/>\n\n===Horticulture===\nThroughout [[South Asia]] and the tropical world, tamarind trees are used as ornamental, garden, and cash crop plantings.

Purcell saw his Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking soar from the 300s to the top 40 and was crowned 1980 ATP Rookie of the Year.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mel card.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Intel Ad|From 2006 [[Ace Authentic]] Heroes & Legends series<ref name=\"cards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aceauthentic.com/item/2006-heroes-and-legends-series-box/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173147/http://www.aceauthentic.com/item/2006-heroes-and-legends-series-box/ |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>]] -->\n\nThe next year he played at Wimbledon, the first of six appearances (1981\u201385, 1987). He reached the quarterfinals in 1983, beating [[Tim Wilkison]], [[Stuart Bale]], [[Andreas Maurer]] and [[Brian Gottfried]] before falling to eventual runner-up [[New Zealand]]'s [[Chris Lewis (tennis)|Chris Lewis]] in a four-set quarterfinal.\n\nPurcell played in the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] 10 times (1978\u201387) where he recorded victories over [[Stan Smith]], [[Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez]] and [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], among others. During this time, he was part of a rare match that saw the eventual loser win two sets 6\u20130. This occurred during his third round loss to [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]] 6\u20133, 0\u20136, 0\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 in the [[1981 US Open (tennis)|1981 US Open]]. He competed in the [[French Open]] six times (1981\u201384, 1987\u201388) where he twice reached the round of 16 in singles and in 1981 reached the doubles quarterfinals with [[Vincent Van Patten]].\n\nAnother career highlight was beating [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Fernando Luna (tennis)|Fernando Luna]] at Boston in 1982 before falling in the final to [[Guillermo Vilas]].\n\nInjuries to his elbow from a car accident and a pulled stomach muscle slowed his career in 1985 but a year later, he beat [[Boris Becker]] in the German Open.\n\nPurcell won three ATP singles titles in 1981: at Atlanta, Tampa and Tel Aviv. He also teamed to claim four doubles titles: at Delray Beach (1982 with [[Chip Hooper]]), Munich (1982 with [[Eliot Teltscher]]) and Vienna (1983 with [[Stan Smith]] and 1987 with [[Tim Wilkison]]).\n\n==Career finals==\n===Singles (3 titles)===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n!style=\"width:40px\"|Result\n!style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L \n!style=\"width:60px\"|Date\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Tournament\n!style=\"width:50px\"|Surface\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Opponent\n!style=\"width:110px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1\u20130 || Mar 1981 || [[Tampa Open|Tampa]], U.S. || Hard || {{flagicon|USA}} [[Jeff Borowiak]] || 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 2\u20130 || Aug 1981 || [[Atlanta]], U.S. || Hard || {{flagicon|France}} [[Gilles Moretton]] || 6\u20134, 6\u20132\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 3\u20130 || Oct 1981 || [[ATP Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv]], Israel || Hard || {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Per Hjertquist]] || 6\u20131, 6\u20131\n|}\n\n===Doubles (3 titles)===\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\" \n!style=\"width:40px\"|Result\n!style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L \n!style=\"width:60px\"|Date\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Tournament\n!style=\"width:50px\"|Surface\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Partner\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Opponents\n!style=\"width:110px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\" |Win\n| 1\u20130\n| Jan 1982\n| [[Delray Beach WCT]], U.S.\n| Clay\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Eliot Teltscher]]\n| {{flagicon|TCH}} [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160m\u00edd]] <br> {{flagicon|HUN}} [[Bal\u00e1zs Tar\u00f3czy]]\n| 6\u20134, 7\u20136\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win\n| 2\u20130\n| May 1982\n| [[1982 Bavarian Tennis Championships|Munich]], Germany\n| Clay\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Chip Hooper]]\n| {{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Tian Viljoen]]<br>{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Danie Visser]]\n| 6\u20134, 7\u20136\n|-\n| style=\"background:#98fb98;\" | Win\n| 3\u20130\n| Oct 1983\n| [[1983 Fischer-Grand Prix|Vienna]], Austria\n| Carpet (i)\n| {{flagicon|USA}} [[Stan Smith]]\n| {{flagicon|BRA|1968}} [[Marcos Hocevar]]<br />{{flagicon|BRA|1968}} [[C\u00e1ssio Motta]]\n| 6\u20133, 6\u20134\n|}\n\n==Today==\nPurcell is the head tennis coach at Murray State University, a post he took in 1996 succeeding his father, hall of fame coach [[Bennie Purcell]].

From 1984 to 2004, the politics of the state essentially was a two party system. The INC regained the state from 1989 to 1994. \n\nThe TDP formed the state government from 1995 to 2004. In 2004, the INC has formed the government again. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://eci.nic.in/StatisticalReports/ElectionStatistics.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416163306/http://eci.nic.in/StatisticalReports/ElectionStatistics.asp |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This government also completed its second term having won the Assembly elections in 2009. The Praja Rajyam Party (PRP) was formed in 2008 by Telugu Film Actor Chiranjeevi that won the third largest number of seats in the 2009 state assembly elections and then merged into congress. After the death of the chief minister [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy|Y. S. Rajashekar Reddy]] his son [[Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy|Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy]] came into lime light. He has resigned from congress after disputes with congress leadership at center. The TDP forms the principal opposition party in the state assembly during this time. \n\nThe state had an ongoing sub-regionalist [[Telangana#Separate Telangana state movement|Telangana movement]] with the [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] (TRS) being formed in 2001 on this platform. And under the leadership of [[K. Chandrashekar Rao|K Chandrashekar Rao]] [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014|separate state]] of [[Telangana]] was carved out of Andra pradesh. Then during next elections TDP had emerged with highest number of seats after fighting the elections with [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] and [[Pawan Kalyan]] who was entering politics during that time. Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has formed a new party after resigning from congress named [[YSR Congress Party|Y. S. R Congress party]] which was the main opposition from 2014\u20132019. During this period [[Jana Sena Party|JanaSena]] the party of Pawan Kalyan cut ties with TDP due to conflict on [[Special Status for Andhra Pradesh Protests|special status of Andra pradesh]] which was one of the commitments during the states bifurcation in 2014. Also TDP cut ties with BJP in 2019 for the same reason. \n\nDuring 2019 assembly and lok sabha elections YSR congress party won with a landslide victory in both elections. Currently TDP is in opposition in the state assembly. JanaSena getting third highest percentage of votes and both BJP and Congress became small parties in Andra Pradesh \n\n<br />\n==Election Commission==\nElections in Andhra Pradesh are conducted by the [[Election Commission of India]] whose state level head is the Chief Election Commissioner of Andhra Pradesh, the authority created under the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]].  It is a well established convention that once the election process commences, no courts intervene until the results are declared by the election commission.  During the elections, vast powers are assigned to the election commission to the extent that it can function as a civil court, if needed.\n\n==Electoral process==\n{{main|Elections_in_India#Electoral_process|l1=Electoral Process in India}}\nThe latest election in Andhra Pradesh were conducted in two phases.<ref>http://eci.nic.in/notification/notification.asp</ref>  All citizens of India above 18 years of age are eligible to enroll as voters in the electoral rolls.  It is the responsibility of the eligible voters to enroll.  Normally, voter registrations are allowed at latest one week prior to the last date for nomination of candidates.\n\n===Pre elections===\nThe Election Commission's Model Code of Conduct enters into force as soon as the notification for polls is issued.  This places restrictions on the campaigning by political parties as well as prohibits certain government actions that would unduly influence the election.\n\n===Voting day===\nThe electoral process is the same as in the rest of India with [[Electronic voting machines#Non-document-based ballot voting systems|Electronic Voting Machines]] being used for all Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections.\n\n===Post elections===\nAfter the election day, the EVMs are stood stored in a strong room under heavy security. After the different phases of the elections are complete, a day is set to count the votes. The votes are tallied and typically, the verdict is known within hours. The candidate who has mustered the most votes is declared the winner of the constituency.\n\nThe party or coalition that has won the most seats is invited by the Governor to form the new government. The coalition or party must prove its majority in the floor of the house (Legislative Assembly) in a vote of confidence by obtaining a simple majority (minimum 50%) of the votes in the House.\n\n==Absentee voting==\nAs of now, India does not have an absentee ballot system. Section 19 of The Representation of the People Act (RPA)-1950<ref>[http://gulbarga.nic.in/karelections2008/ACTS/RPAct1950.pdf Representation of the People Act-1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226073956/http://gulbarga.nic.in/karelections2008/ACTS/RPAct1950.pdf |date=26 February 2009 }}</ref> allows a person to register to vote if he or she is above 18 years of age and is an \u2018ordinary resident\u2019 of the residing constituency i.e. living at the current address for 6 months or longer. Section 20 of the above Act disqualifies a non-resident Indian (NRI) from getting his/her name registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevents an NRI from casting his/her vote in elections to the Parliament and to the State Legislatures.\n\nThe Representation of the People (Amendment) 2006 Bill was introduced in the Parliament by Shri Hanraj Bharadwaj, Minister of Law and Justice during February 2006 with an objective to amend Section 20 of the RPA-1950 to enable NRIs to vote. Despite the report submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee two years ago, the Government has so far failed to act on the recommendations. The Bill was reintroduced in the 2008 budget session of the Parliament to the Lok Sabha. But no action taken once again.\n\nSeveral civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.<ref>[http://voterswithoutborders.org Petition for Absentee Voting in Indian Elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234322/http://voterswithoutborders.org/ |date=16 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://tanushreebagrodia.blogspot.com/2008/12/nri-voting-rights-and-upcoming.html Non-Resident Indians Voting rights in the upcoming general elections ]</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Subrata K.

From 1984 to 2004, the politics of the state essentially was a two party system. The INC regained the state from 1989 to 1994. \n\nThe TDP formed the state government from 1995 to 2004. In 2004, the INC has formed the government again. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://eci.nic.in/StatisticalReports/ElectionStatistics.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416163306/http://eci.nic.in/StatisticalReports/ElectionStatistics.asp |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This government also completed its second term having won the Assembly elections in 2009. The Praja Rajyam Party (PRP) was formed in 2008 by Telugu Film Actor Chiranjeevi that won the third largest number of seats in the 2009 state assembly elections and then merged into congress. After the death of the chief minister [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy|Y. S. Rajashekar Reddy]] his son [[Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy|Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy]] came into lime light. He has resigned from congress after disputes with congress leadership at center. The TDP forms the principal opposition party in the state assembly during this time. \n\nThe state had an ongoing sub-regionalist [[Telangana#Separate Telangana state movement|Telangana movement]] with the [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] (TRS) being formed in 2001 on this platform. And under the leadership of [[K. Chandrashekar Rao|K Chandrashekar Rao]] [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014|separate state]] of [[Telangana]] was carved out of Andra pradesh. Then during next elections TDP had emerged with highest number of seats after fighting the elections with [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] and [[Pawan Kalyan]] who was entering politics during that time. Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has formed a new party after resigning from congress named [[YSR Congress Party|Y. S. R Congress party]] which was the main opposition from 2014-2019. During this period [[Jana Sena Party|JanaSena]] the party of Pawan Kalyan cut ties with TDP due to conflict on [[Special Status for Andhra Pradesh Protests|special status of Andra pradesh]] which was one of the commitments during the states bifurcation in 2014. Also TDP cut ties with BJP in 2019 for the same reason. \n\nDuring 2019 assembly and lok sabha elections YSR congress party won with a land slide victory in both elections. Currently TDP is in opposition in the state assembly. JanaSena getting third highest percentage of votes and both BJP and Congress became small parties in Andra Pradesh \n\n<br />\n==Election Commission==\nElections in Andhra Pradesh are conducted by the [[Election Commission of India]] whose state level head is the Chief Election Commissioner of Andhra Pradesh, the authority created under the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]].  It is a well established convention that once the election process commences, no courts intervene until the results are declared by the election commission.  During the elections, vast powers are assigned to the election commission to the extent that it can function as a civil court, if needed.\n\n==Electoral process==\n{{main|Elections_in_India#Electoral_process|l1=Electoral Process in India}}\nThe latest election in Andhra Pradesh were conducted in two phases.<ref>http://eci.nic.in/notification/notification.asp</ref>  All citizens of India above 18 years of age are eligible to enroll as voters in the electoral rolls.  It is the responsibility of the eligible voters to enroll.  Normally, voter registrations are allowed at latest one week prior to the last date for nomination of candidates.\n\n===Pre elections===\nThe Election Commission's Model Code of Conduct enters into force as soon as the notification for polls is issued.  This places restrictions on the campaigning by political parties as well as prohibits certain government actions that would unduly influence the election.\n\n===Voting day===\nThe electoral process is the same as in the rest of India with [[Electronic voting machines#Non-document-based ballot voting systems|Electronic Voting Machines]] being used for all Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections.\n\n===Post elections===\nAfter the election day, the EVMs are stood stored in a strong room under heavy security. After the different phases of the elections are complete, a day is set to count the votes. The votes are tallied and typically, the verdict is known within hours. The candidate who has mustered the most votes is declared the winner of the constituency.\n\nThe party or coalition that has won the most seats is invited by the Governor to form the new government. The coalition or party must prove its majority in the floor of the house (Legislative Assembly) in a vote of confidence by obtaining a simple majority (minimum 50%) of the votes in the House.\n\n==Absentee voting==\nAs of now, India does not have an absentee ballot system. Section 19 of The Representation of the People Act (RPA)-1950<ref>[http://gulbarga.nic.in/karelections2008/ACTS/RPAct1950.pdf Representation of the People Act-1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226073956/http://gulbarga.nic.in/karelections2008/ACTS/RPAct1950.pdf |date=26 February 2009 }}</ref> allows a person to register to vote if he or she is above 18 years of age and is an \u2018ordinary resident\u2019 of the residing constituency i.e. living at the current address for 6 months or longer. Section 20 of the above Act disqualifies a non-resident Indian (NRI) from getting his/her name registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevents an NRI from casting his/her vote in elections to the Parliament and to the State Legislatures.\n\nThe Representation of the People (Amendment) 2006 Bill was introduced in the Parliament by Shri Hanraj Bharadwaj, Minister of Law and Justice during February 2006 with an objective to amend Section 20 of the RPA-1950 to enable NRIs to vote. Despite the report submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee two years ago, the Government has so far failed to act on the recommendations. The Bill was reintroduced in the 2008 budget session of the Parliament to the Lok Sabha. But no action taken once again.\n\nSeveral civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.<ref>[http://voterswithoutborders.org Petition for Absentee Voting in Indian Elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234322/http://voterswithoutborders.org/ |date=16 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://tanushreebagrodia.blogspot.com/2008/12/nri-voting-rights-and-upcoming.html Non-Resident Indians Voting rights in the upcoming general elections ]</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Subrata K.
