The hostility of both was no secret to the Prussian government.\n\nOtto and Ludwig were often seen together during the early years of Ludwig's reign, but they became estranged over time. Ludwig was shy and introverted and eventually became a recluse. Otto was cheerful, outgoing and extroverted until the Franco-Prussian War.

Otto had spells during which he slept poorly for days and acted out, followed by periods of time during which he was perfectly normal and lucid. His illness progressively grew worse. Ludwig was horrified because he had been counting on Otto to marry and have a son who could eventually inherit the throne. Otto was placed under medical supervision, and reports about his condition were sent by spies working for the Prussian Chancellor, [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Doctors reported that Otto was mentally ill in January 1872. From 1873, he was held in isolation in the southern pavilion of [[Nymphenburg Palace]]. His attending physician was Dr. [[Bernhard von Gudden]], who later diagnosed Otto's brother, Ludwig, as mentally ill without bothering to examine him and without asking him a single question, which raises questions about his competence and his motives. Both Ludwig and Otto despised Prussia, and their uncle, [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]], and Gudden supported Prussia's rise to dominance. Some contemporaries believed that Gudden's diagnoses of Otto and Ludwig were motivated by political considerations and that more could and should have been done to help and treat Otto. Some contemporaries also believed that Bismarck did not want Ludwig or Otto to remain in power and decided to replace the brothers with their malleable uncle, Luitpold.<ref>Catherine Radziwill, \"The Tragedy of a Throne\", p 170-172, 314\u2013318</ref>\n\nDuring Corpus Christi Mass in 1875 in the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche in Munich]], Otto, who had not attended the church service, rushed into the church wearing hunting clothes and fell on his knees before the celebrant, Archbishop [[Gregor Leonhard Andreas von Scherr|Gregor von Scherr]], to ask forgiveness for his sins. The High Mass was interrupted, and the prince did not resist when he was led away by two church ministers. Otto was then moved to [[Schleissheim Palace]] and was effectively held prisoner there, much to his dismay. Gudden made no effort to treat him; it is possible that Otto was heavily drugged. Otto's last public appearance was his presence at the side of his brother at the King's parade on 22 August 1875, at the [[Marsfeld (Munich)|Marsfeld]] in Munich. From 1 June 1876, he stayed for a few weeks in the castle at Ludwigsthal in the Bavarian Forest. In the spring of 1880, his condition worsened. In 1883, he was confined under medical supervision in [[F\u00fcrstenried Palace]] near Munich, where he would remain for the rest of his life. The palace had been specially converted for his confinement. Ludwig occasionally visited him at night and ordered for no violence to be used against him.\n\nOtto became king after Ludwig died, but he was never truly allowed to reign. In 1886, the senior royal medical officer wrote a statement declaring that Otto was severely mentally ill.<ref>The University Department of Psychiatry in Munich: From Kraepelin and his predecessors to molecular psychiatry.

Ludwig died only three days later under unexplained circumstances. That meant that Otto became king on 13 June 1886. He was, however, unable to rule. The official explanation \"the King is melancholic\". The proclamation of his inauguration was read to him at F\u00fcrstenried Castle the next day, but he failed to understand it. He only enjoyed being henceforth called \"Your Majesty\" by his servants.<ref>A. Schweiggert, E. Adami: ''Ludwig II. Die letzten Tage des K\u00f6nigs von Bayern.'' M\u00fcnchenVerlag 2014, p. 236</ref>\n\n== End of reign and death ==\nLuitpold kept his role as Prince Regent until he died in 1912 and was succeeded by his son Ludwig, who was Otto's first cousin. By then, it had been obvious for some time that Otto would never emerge from seclusion or be mentally capable of actively reigning. Almost as soon as Ludwig became regent, elements in the press and larger society clamoured for Ludwig to become king in his own right.\n\nAccordingly, the constitution of Bavaria was amended on 4 November 1913 to include a clause specifying that if a regency for reasons of incapacity lasted for ten years, with no expectation that the King would ever be able to reign, the Regent could end the regency, depose the King and assume the crown himself with the assent of the legislature. The following day, Prince Regent Ludwig ended the regency and proclaimed his own reign as [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]]. The parliament assented on 6 November, and Ludwig III took the constitutional oath on 8 November. King Otto was permitted to retain his title and honours for life.\n\n[[File:Body of King Otto I of Bavaria.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard photograph from 1916 of King Otto's body in repose.]]\n\nOtto died unexpectedly on 11 October 1916 from a [[volvulus]] (an obstruction of the bowel). His remains were interred in the [[crypt]] of the ''[[Michaelskirche (M\u00fcnchen)|Michaelskirche]]'' in Munich. Bavarian tradition caused the heart of the king to be placed in a silver urn and sent to the {{lang|de|Gnadenkapelle}} (Chapel of the Miraculous Image) in [[Alt\u00f6tting]], beside those of his [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|brother]], [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|father]] and [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|grandfather]].\n\n==Titles, styles and honours==\n===Titles and styles===\n*27 April 1848 \u2013 13 June 1886: ''His Royal Highness'' Prince Otto of Bavaria\n*13 June 1886 \u2013 5 November 1913: ''His Majesty'' The King of Bavaria\n*5 November 1913 \u2013 11 October 1916: ''His Majesty'' King Otto of Bavaria\n\n===Honours===\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Bavaria}}:<ref name=\"p14\">Justus Perthes, ''Almanach de Gotha 1913'' (1913) [https://archive.org/details/almanachdegotha00unse_50/page/n69 page 14]</ref>\n** Grand Master of the [[Order of St. Hubert]]\n** Grand Master of the [[Royal Order of Saint George for the Defense of the Immaculate Conception|Order of Saint George]]\n* {{flag|Kingdom of Prussia}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]]<ref name=\"p14\"/>\n* {{flag|Austria-Hungary}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] - 1869<ref name=\"p14\"/><ref>[http://www.antiquesatoz.com/sgfleece/knights5.htm \"Toison Autrichienne (Austrian Fleece) - 19th century\"] (in French), ''Chevaliers de la Toison D'or''.

Otto's last public appearance was his presence at the side of his brother at the King's parade on 22 August 1875, at the [[Marsfeld (Munich)|Marsfeld]] in Munich. From 1 June 1876, he stayed for a few weeks in the castle at Ludwigsthal in the Bavarian Forest. In the spring of 1880, his condition worsened. In 1883, he was confined under medical supervision in [[F\u00fcrstenried Palace]] near Munich, where he would remain for the rest of his life. The palace had been specially converted for his confinement. Ludwig occasionally visited him at night and ordered for no violence to be used against him.\n\nOtto became king after Ludwig died, but he was never truly allowed to reign. In 1886, the senior royal medical officer wrote a statement declaring that Otto was severely mentally ill.<ref>The University Department of Psychiatry in Munich: From Kraepelin and his predecessors to molecular psychiatry.

Ludwig died only three days later under unexplained circumstances. That meant that Otto became king on 13 June 1886. He was, however, unable to rule. The official explanation \"the King is melancholic\". The proclamation of his inauguration was read to him at F\u00fcrstenried Castle the next day, but he failed to understand it. He only enjoyed being henceforth called \"Your Majesty\" by his servants.<ref>A. Schweiggert, E. Adami: ''Ludwig II. Die letzten Tage des K\u00f6nigs von Bayern.'' M\u00fcnchenVerlag 2014, p. 236</ref>\n\n== End of reign and death ==\nLuitpold kept his role as Prince Regent until he died in 1912 and was succeeded by his son Ludwig, who was Otto's first cousin. By then, it had been obvious for some time that Otto would never emerge from seclusion or be mentally capable of actively reigning. Almost as soon as Ludwig became regent, elements in the press and larger society clamoured for Ludwig to become king in his own right.\n\nAccordingly, the constitution of Bavaria was amended on 4 November 1913 to include a clause specifying that if a regency for reasons of incapacity lasted for ten years, with no expectation that the King would ever be able to reign, the Regent could end the regency, depose the King and assume the crown himself with the assent of the legislature. The following day, Prince Regent Ludwig ended the regency and proclaimed his own reign as [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]]. The parliament assented on 6 November, and Ludwig III took the constitutional oath on 8 November. King Otto was permitted to retain his title and honours for life.\n\n[[File:Body of King Otto I of Bavaria.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard photograph from 1916 of King Otto's body in repose.]]\n\nOtto died unexpectedly on 11 October 1916 from a [[volvulus]] (an obstruction of the bowel).

Melbourne Football club was first formed on 31 July 1858 when a code of rules were written.  These rules were based on school football rules but made simpler, so they were easier to follow.\n\nThe earliest official formal leagues were the [[SANFL|South Australian National Football League]] at the time called the South Australian Football Association and the [[Victorian Football Association]] formed in 1877. The first [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|intercolonial matches]] were played shortly after in 1879. The game was first known as Melbourne rules football then as the game spread throughout the country, it became known as Victorian rules football and then Australian rules football. The game was shaped in the early years through feed back from clubs, players and spectators.  The rules changes from this feedback was addressed from at least 1860 in the annual meeting of club secretaries usually held in May.\n\nBy [[federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, the game was the main winter sport in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]], with the [[Victorian Football League]](VFL), [[South Australian National Football League]] and the [[West Australian Football League]] operating as separate competitions. The game was played in New South Wales and Queensland but was second in popularity to [[rugby union]] as the main winter sport.\n\nIn the 1990s, the VFL became the [[Australian Football League]], a national body and the premier league in Australia, and later became the [[de facto]] world governing body for the sport.\n\n==Origins of the sport==\n{{further|Origins of Australian rules football}}\n{{further|History of Australian rules football in Victoria (1859\u20131900)}} \n\nIn 1857 a book called \"Tom Brown's School days by an old boy\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tombrownsschool00cogoog|quote=tom brown's school days.|title=Tom Brown's School Days|last=Hughes|first=Thomas|date=1857|publisher=Macmillan|language=en}}</ref> was published and became very popular and promoted football in Victorian schools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7299303|title=POLICE.|date=1858-08-16|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-09-29|pages=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5682549|title=SUMMARY FOR EUROPE.|date=1860-05-17|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-10-01|pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154844393|title=MISCELLANEOUS.|date=1860-08-30|work=Age (Melbourne, Vic. : 1854 - 1954)|access-date=2019-10-01|pages=5}}</ref> On 29 May 1858 the Argus published an article on the book, which got people talking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7295303|title=REVIEW.|date=1858-05-29|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-10-02|pages=6}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7298949|title=NEW SOUTH WALES.|date=1858-08-09|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-09-29|pages=5}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64508818|title=THE INDIAN RELIEF FUND.|date=1858-08-11|work=Portland Guardian and Normanby General Advertiser (Vic. : 1842 - 1843; 1854 - 1876)|access-date=2019-09-29|pages=3}}</ref>.

In 1860, after changes and agreement from other clubs, the rules name was changed to \"Victorian Rules of Football\" and they were seen to be the official rules of most clubs in Victoria. In the 1858 season and later, if both clubs did not use the Victorian Rules each match was played by common rules agreed by the two teams involved. By 1866, however, several other clubs had agreed to play by an updated version of Melbourne rules.\n[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|290x290px|A game at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]] in the 1860s.

He then has a free kick.

Village football seemed to be strong and was being played socially. Inter-village football seemed to be occurring less. Football had lost a lot of it flare, it appears injuries and weather had effected it. A letter to a newspaper  called for the game to changed to remove running and charging and involve more kick to kicks. This push was to change the game, from rough the style of Rugby, which had been suggested at various times since 1859. As many games were scratched, as player did not turn up, it may of been the view of many the game was too rough. More bowls clubs started to form as an alternative to football. Young boys were taken by the fad of sling shotting.   Hammersley, H. C Harrison and others formed a committee and ran athletic games on the MCG. Drop kicks reached 161 yards in competitions, it would have been measured from when the ball stopped rolling..  At the end of the season Geelong still held the Challenge Cup after three unsuccessful attempts to win it from them. Geelong continued to organise the \"Australians v World\" games throughout the season.

There were a number of clubs, which were rated in unofficial divisions. E.g. Principal, 2nd class, juniors, country etc. H C Harrison said he was retiring from playing football after playing nearly 15 years. Injuries from the previous season were still an issue and doctors advised him not to play. Other older players including Conway also retired, the newer players played a different game to the older ones.   \n\nSouth Yarra  wanted to change some more rules.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138089795|title=ATHLETIC SPORTS.|date=1872-04-27|work=Australasian (Melbourne, Vic. : 1864 - 1946)|access-date=2019-10-07|pages=13}}</ref>There were a number of rule changes made to sped up the game.  A kick had to be obtained by the ball hitting the player on or below the knee.  Goals could no longer be rushed/forced through, but needed to be kicked. The teams changed ends at half time.  The field umpire had more duties like; settling disputes, doing a toss-up when scrimmages occurred or thrown in, if the ball went out of bounds between kick off post and boundary.  The use of Field Umpires was improving the game.\n\nA football club reformed in St Kilda and South Yarra also reformed putting a question of merger.   South Yarra had lost players and junior players were playing in local junior clubs. Players could not commit and did little training and split into two trading camps one at  South Yarra, the other St Kilda.  A football club was reformed in St Kilda but could not play during the season as it had no ground to play on.  \n\n=== 16th Season ===\n1873 season started like the other recent seasons, however one of the foundation teams South Yarra did not last the full season. It was for a number of reasons, players going to other clubs, older players retiring and maybe problems within the committee, not wanting to officially merge with another club. Carlton again was the premium club. The new St Kilda Football Club first playing season was regarded by them as a brilliant success.  In their first season they only played second class teams, with the inclusion of Albert Park.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137583406|title=ST.

Instances of  slinging or throwing a player by holding when he did not have the ball, grabbing  around the neck, were not being penalised.

By 1916 the game was first played in the Northern Territory, establishing a permanent presence in all Australian states and Mainland territories.\n\nIn [[Newcastle, New South Wales]] the Black Diamond league was founded by Victorian goldminers and the [[Black Diamond Australian Football League|Black Diamond Challenge Cup]] remains Australia's oldest sporting trophy.\n\nThe first [[interstate match in Australian rules football|intercolonial match]] was held between Victoria and South Australia in 1879.\n\nFactors such as intercolonial (and later interstate) rivalry and the denial of access to grounds in Sydney by the dominant rugby codes caused the code to struggle in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\n===Formation of the VFL===\n[[File:Essendon fc 1897.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Essendon, first VFL premiers in 1897]]\nA rift in the VFA led to the formation of the [[VFL/AFL|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), which commenced play in 1897 as an eight-team breakaway of the stronger clubs in the VFA competition: Carlton, [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], Essendon, [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]], Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne. The first season concluded with Essendon finishing as the premiers (winners).\n\nAnother five VFA clubs joined the VFL later: [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[University Football Club|University]] joined the VFL in 1908, although University withdrew in 1915 [[The VFL during the World Wars|due to the war]]. Footscray, [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and North Melbourne joined in 1925, by which time VFL had become the most prominent league in the game.\n\n===Interstate competition===\n{{main|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}\n[[File:1933 state carnival SCG football.jpg|thumb|250px|Players contest a mark at the 1933 [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|Australian Football Carnival]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. The teams are Victoria and Tasmania. (Photographer: [[Sam Hood]].)]] For most of the 20th century, the absence of a national club competition - and the inability of players to compete internationally \u2013 meant that matches between state representative teams were regarded with great importance. The first intercolonial match was first played in 1879 between Victoria and South Australia. VFL clubs increasingly recruited the best players in other states, one of the reasons Victoria dominated these games. However, [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] rules were introduced in 1977, and in the first such game, at [[Subiaco Oval]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia defeated Victoria, 23.13 (151) to 8.9 (57), a huge reversal of the results in most previous games. Western Australia and South Australia began to win a lot more of their games against Victoria. However, during the 1990s, following the emergence of the Australian Football League and the game becoming full professional State of Origin games declined in importance especially after an increasing number of withdrawals who were under increasing pressure from clubs concerned by the risk of injuries. Australian football State of Origin matches ceased in 1999. The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate matches.\n\n===A national league===\nIn 1982, in a move which heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs South Melbourne Football Club relocated to the [[rugby league]] stronghold of [[Sydney]] and became known as the [[Sydney Swans]]. In the late 1980s strong interstate interest in the VFL led to a more national competition; two more non-Victorian clubs, the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the [[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane Bears]] began playing in 1987.\n\nThe league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]]. West Coast's [[local derby]] rival [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] was admitted in 1995. The Fitzroy Lions merged with Brisbane Bears after 1996 due to financial difficulties to form the [[Brisbane Lions]] and the proud old SANFL club, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] joined in 1997 as Port Adelaide Power, immediately becoming fierce local rivals to Adelaide. In 2011 The Gold Coast Suns were admitted into the league followed by the Greater Western Sydney Giants (GWS) in 2012. The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and the most powerful body in the world of Australian rules football.\n\n===Today's state leagues===\nFor much of the 20th century, the SANFL and the WAFL were considered peers of the VFL. Although the VFL was generally accepted as the strongest league, they frequently played each other on an even footing in challenge matches and occasional nationwide club competitions. The other states and territories also infrequently participated in interstate matches when they were able to field a strong side.\n\nWith the introduction of the AFL the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas.\n\nThe VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name.\n\n===Australian football internationally===\n{{main|Australian football around the world}}\n\n[[File:Linkbelt1999-Finalspiel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Action from an Aussie Rules game in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]] at the [[Linkbelt Oval]]]]\n\nAlmost as soon as the game was becoming established in Australia, it had spread to [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] in 1878. [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]] followed in the 1880s, with the help of Australian goldminers; they were augmented by soldiers during the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nIn 1888, a touring British [[rugby football|rugby]] team played 19 games of Australian rules against clubs in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia. The tourists, who had been hastily trained in the local code, played [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in front of 25,000 people &mdash;  a substantial crowd at the time &mdash; in their first game. They even had a win over [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]]. However, the tourists returned to rugby once they left Australia and the foundation of Australian rules clubs overseas was still many years away.\n\nAs the game spread to New Zealand the national governing body the Australian Football Council became known as the Australasian Football Council then changed back after the game declined in popularity in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1908, New Zealand was home to a formidable league of 115 clubs, and their national team defeated both New South Wales and Queensland at the [[1908 Melbourne Carnival|Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival]], an event held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football. The game was also introduced to [[Australian rules football in England|England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]]. The profound effects of [[World War I]] caused the gradual demise in the game in countries outside Australia, including New Zealand.\n\nThe first nation outside of Australia to take the sport up seriously was the former Australian territory of [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], which began playing in the 1930s.  The game is now the national sport of the country. Another former territory, [[Australian rules football in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] began playing in the 1950s.  For a time at least, it was the most popular sport in the country, and still remains popular. [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] resumed a local competition in 1974.\n\nThe first ever international match involving Australia was played in 1977 at under 17 level between Australia and Papua New Guinea in Adelaide, with Australia taking the honours [https://web.archive.org/web/20120210120902/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/1977_to_1980.htm]. Since then, Australia have been peerless in the sport and seldom compete at international level.\n\nIn the late 1980s, as distance became less of an obstacle, amateur teams were established in [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]] (1987) and [[Australian rules football in England|England]], [[Denmark]] and [[Australian rules football in Canada|Canada]] (1989).   In the 1990s, amateur competition has grown in countries such as [[Sweden]] (1993), [[Germany]] (1995), [[Australian rules football in the United States|USA]] (1996), [[Argentina]], [[Spain]] and [[Samoa]] (1997), [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]] (1998), as well as a number of solely expatriate teams, mainly based in [[South East Asia]].\n\nSince 2000, fledgeling competitions have been established in countries such as [[Ireland]] (2000), [[Tonga]] (2002), [[Scotland]], [[France]] and [[China]] (2005), [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]] (2006), [[Catalonia]], [[Norway]] and [[East Timor]]. Many of these were initially established by Australian expatriates but collecting growing numbers of native players. In other countries, it grew out of AFL exhibition matches, cult television following or Internet communication.  [[North America]]n fans formed an organization, [[AFANA]], specifically to work for improved media coverage of Australian football.\n\nSince the 1990s, the AFL and other development bodies have contributed to the development the game overseas. There are now youth development programs in several of these countries; since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the AFL as part of its International Policy, has hosted several of junior teams from other countries.\n\nThe [[Arafura Games]], held in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]], Australia is a [[Multi-sport event]] for [[South East Asia]] and [[East Asia]]n island nations, northern Australia and the [[Pacific Islands]] which has Australian football as a permanent competition sport, rather than a [[demonstration sport]]. Papua New Guinea won the [[gold medal]] and retained it in subsequent games. Other teams that have competed at Australian Rules in the games include Japan, Nauru and a Northern Territory [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] team.\n\nThe [[International Australian Football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after the 1995 Arafura Games. Following internal divisions in the IAFC, another organization, [[Aussie Rules International]] was set up in [[London]]. The AFL did not recognise the IAFC as anything more than a promotional body, and is itself considered the keeper of the code. Hence the AFL is primarily responsible for funding and governance and provides around [[Australian dollar|A$]]500,000 annually for international development, especially junior programs. The code is not large enough outside Australia for an international [[sport governing body|governing body]] made up of national bodies.\n\nInspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was held in Melbourne in 2002, an initiative of the IAFC and the AFL. With the closure of the IAFC subsequent cups are staged by the AFL.  The 2002 cup was contested by 11 teams from around the world made up exclusively of non-Australians. [[Ireland]] won the 2002 cup, defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final. (See also: [[List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia|Australian football leagues outside Australia]].)\n\nToday, Australian football is a major spectator sport in Australia and [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], although occasional [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition games]] are staged in other countries.  Some local grand final and carnival type events in [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Nauru]], [[England]] and the [[United States]] have occasionally drawn attendances that number in the thousands.\n\nOn 3 July 2006 the AFL announced that it had formed an International Development Committee to support overseas (non-Australian) football leagues. The AFL also hope to develop the game in other countries to the point where Australian football is played at an international level by top-quality sides from around the world. The AFL has hosted an International Cup regularly every three years, beginning in 2002, with the third game in 2008 corresponding to the 150th anniversary of the code.<ref>[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=2006063006252654 AFL International Development plans] at www.worldfootynews.com.</ref>\n\n====International rules football====\n{{main|International rules football}}\n\nSince 1967, there have been many matches between Australian and Irish teams, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules drawn from both Australian and [[Gaelic football]]. The current rules use the round ball and the rectangular field and cross-bar posts of Gaelic football. The fierce tackling and marking of the Australian code is allowed.\n\nIn 1984, the first official representative matches of [[International Rules football]] were played, and these are now played annually each October.\n\nIn 1999, a record Australian International Rules crowd of 65,000 at the [[MCG]] attended a game that saw Ireland defeat Australia but Australia win the series. In 2002, a record Irish International Rules crowd of 71,532 at [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]] witnessed a draw which also saw Australia win the series.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lynedochpublications.com.au/ Hammersley, Harrison]\n\n<br />{{Australian rules football|state=collapsed}}\n{{Football codes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Australian Rules Football}}\n[[Category:History of Australian rules football| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=July 2011}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2007}}\n{{main|Australian rules football}}\n[[File:Tom wills statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Tom Wills]] umpiring a football match in 1858, believed to be one of the defining moments in the history of Australian rules football]]\nAustralian rules football began its evolution in [[Melbourne]], Australia about 1858.

Melbourne Football club was first formed on 31 July 1858 when a code of rules were written.  These rules were based on school football rules but made simpler, so they were easier to follow.\n\nThe earliest official formal leagues were the [[SANFL|South Australian National Football League]] at the time called the South Australian Football Association and the [[Victorian Football Association]] formed in 1877. The first [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|intercolonial matches]] were played shortly after in 1879. The game was first known as Melbourne rules football then as the game spread throughout the country, it became known as Victorian rules football and then Australian rules football. The game was shaped in the early years through feed back from clubs, players and spectators.  The rules changes from this feedback was addressed from at least 1860 in the annual meeting of club secretaries usually held in May.\n\nBy [[federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, the game was the main winter sport in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]], with the [[Victorian Football League]](VFL), [[South Australian National Football League]] and the [[West Australian Football League]] operating as separate competitions. The game was played in New South Wales and Queensland but was second in popularity to [[rugby union]] as the main winter sport.\n\nIn the 1990s, the VFL became the [[Australian Football League]], a national body and the premier league in Australia, and later became the [[de facto]] world governing body for the sport.\n\n==Origins of the sport==\n{{further|Origins of Australian rules football}}\n{{further|History of Australian rules football in Victoria (1859\u20131900)}} \n\nIn 1857 a book called \"Tom Brown's School days by an old boy\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tombrownsschool00cogoog|quote=tom brown's school days.|title=Tom Brown's School Days|last=Hughes|first=Thomas|date=1857|publisher=Macmillan|language=en}}</ref> was published and became very popular and promoted football in Victorian schools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7299303|title=POLICE.|date=1858-08-16|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-09-29|pages=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5682549|title=SUMMARY FOR EUROPE.|date=1860-05-17|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-10-01|pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article154844393|title=MISCELLANEOUS.|date=1860-08-30|work=Age (Melbourne, Vic. : 1854 - 1954)|access-date=2019-10-01|pages=5}}</ref> On 29 May 1858 the Argus published an article on the book, which got people talking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7295303|title=REVIEW.|date=1858-05-29|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-10-02|pages=6}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7298949|title=NEW SOUTH WALES.|date=1858-08-09|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=2019-09-29|pages=5}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64508818|title=THE INDIAN RELIEF FUND.|date=1858-08-11|work=Portland Guardian and Normanby General Advertiser (Vic. : 1842 - 1843; 1854 - 1876)|access-date=2019-09-29|pages=3}}</ref>.

Village football seemed to be strong and was being played socially. Inter-village football seemed to be occurring less. Football had lost a lot of it flare, it appears injuries and weather had effected it. A letter to a newspaper  called for the game to changed to remove running and charging and involve more kick to kicks. This push was to change the game, from rough the style of Rugby, which had been suggested at various times since 1859. As many games were scratched, as player did not turn up, it may of been the view of many the game was too rough. More bowls clubs started to form as an alternative to football. Young boys were taken by the fad of sling shotting.   Hammersley, H. C Harrison and others formed a committee and ran athletic games on the MCG. Drop kicks reached 161 yards in competitions, it would have been measured from when the ball stopped rolling..  At the end of the season Geelong still held the Challenge Cup after three unsuccessful attempts to win it from them. Geelong continued to organise the \"Australians v World\" games throughout the season. In Bell's life a series of article were published from the pages of ''The Field''  looked at was how to amalgamation of the school rules from Rugby, Eton, Harrow, Shrewsbury and Marlborough, and helped to create united game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article199057627|title=The Harrow Game, the Charter-House Rules, and the Winchester Goals.|date=1864-05-28|work=Bell's Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle (Melbourne, Vic. : 1857 - 1868)|access-date=2019-10-09|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n=== 8th season ===\n\nIn 1865 there was a change in the direction of the game.

It gave the impression the author could be related to the father of football, it may of been no one man but a group.  The author played in the first games and quoted watching  the writing of the rules in the back room of the Parade hotel.  He supported the view of some that it was JB Thompson through his newspaper promoted football in the early days.  He talks about the scars he had from football.  He wanted the government to fix up the Richmond paddock for football, so it was fit for football.  He believed football fields not being fenced was holding up the development of the game and spectators needed to be kept off the field.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138086485|title=FOOTBALL FAST AND PRESENT.|date=1871-11-04|work=Australasian (Melbourne, Vic. : 1864 - 1946)|access-date=2019-10-10|pages=11}}</ref> An interesting thing happened in Ballarat where the Cricket and Football clubs share the same ground and mainly the same committees.

There were a number of clubs, which were rated in unofficial divisions. Eg Principal, 2nd class, juniors, country etc. H C Harrison said he was retiring from playing football after playing nearly 15 years. Injuries from the previous season were still an issue and doctors advised him not to play. Other older players including Conway also retired, the newer players played a different game to the older ones.   \n\nSouth Yarra  wanted to change some more rules.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138089795|title=ATHLETIC SPORTS.|date=1872-04-27|work=Australasian (Melbourne, Vic. : 1864 - 1946)|access-date=2019-10-07|pages=13}}</ref>There were a number of rule changes made to sped up the game.  A kick had to be obtained by the ball hitting the player on or below the knee.  Goals could no longer be rushed/forced through, but needed to be kicked. The teams changed ends at half time.  The field umpire had more duties like; settling disputes, doing a toss-up when scrimmages occurred or thrown in, if the ball went out of bounds between kick off post and boundary.  The use of Field Umpires was improving the game.\n\nA football club reformed in St Kilda and South Yarra also reformed putting a question of merger.   South Yarra had lost players and junior players were playing in local junior clubs. Players could not commit and did little training and split into two trading camps one at  South Yarra, the other St Kilda.  A football club was reformed in St Kilda but could not play during the season as it had no ground to play on.  \n\n=== 16th Season ===\n1873 season started like the other recent seasons, however one of the foundation teams South Yarra did not last the full season. It was for a number of reasons, players going to other clubs, older players retiring and maybe problems within the committee, not wanting to officially merge with another club. Carlton again was the premium club. The new St Kilda Football Club first playing season was regarded by them as a brilliant success.  In their first season they only played second class teams, with the inclusion of Albert Park.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137583406|title=ST.

Instances of  slinging or throwing a player by holding when he did not have the ball, grabbing  around the neck, were not being penalised.

A lot of community football was being recorded in newspapers.  The games still had a central and goal umpires.  The ball was still being kicked off from the centre of ground.

By 1916 the game was first played in the Northern Territory, establishing a permanent presence in all Australian states and Mainland territories.\n\nIn [[Newcastle, New South Wales]] the Black Diamond league was founded by Victorian goldminers and the [[Black Diamond Australian Football League|Black Diamond Challenge Cup]] remains Australia's oldest sporting trophy.\n\nThe first [[interstate match in Australian rules football|intercolonial match]] was held between Victoria and South Australia in 1879.\n\nFactors such as intercolonial (and later interstate) rivalry and the denial of access to grounds in Sydney by the dominant rugby codes caused the code to struggle in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\n===Formation of the VFL===\n[[File:Essendon fc 1897.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Essendon, first VFL premiers in 1897]]\nA rift in the VFA led to the formation of the [[VFL/AFL|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), which commenced play in 1897 as an eight-team breakaway of the stronger clubs in the VFA competition: Carlton, [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], Essendon, [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]], Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne. The first season concluded with Essendon finishing as the premiers (winners).\n\nAnother five VFA clubs joined the VFL later: [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[University Football Club|University]] joined the VFL in 1908, although University withdrew in 1915 [[The VFL during the World Wars|due to the war]]. Footscray, [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and North Melbourne joined in 1925, by which time VFL had become the most prominent league in the game.\n\n===Interstate competition===\n{{main|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}\n[[File:1933 state carnival SCG football.jpg|thumb|250px|Players contest a mark at the 1933 [[interstate matches in Australian rules football|Australian Football Carnival]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. The teams are Victoria and Tasmania. (Photographer: [[Sam Hood]].)]] For most of the 20th century, the absence of a national club competition - and the inability of players to compete internationally \u2013 meant that matches between state representative teams were regarded with great importance. The first intercolonial match was first played in 1879 between Victoria and South Australia. VFL clubs increasingly recruited the best players in other states, one of the reasons Victoria dominated these games. However, [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] rules were introduced in 1977, and in the first such game, at [[Subiaco Oval]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia defeated Victoria, 23.13 (151) to 8.9 (57), a huge reversal of the results in most previous games. Western Australia and South Australia began to win a lot more of their games against Victoria. However, during the 1990s, following the emergence of the Australian Football League and the game becoming full professional State of Origin games declined in importance especially after an increasing number of withdrawals who were under increasing pressure from clubs concerned by the risk of injuries. Australian football State of Origin matches ceased in 1999. The second-tier state and territorial leagues still contest interstate matches.\n\n===A national league===\nIn 1982, in a move which heralded big changes within the sport, one of the original VFL clubs South Melbourne Football Club relocated to the [[rugby league]] stronghold of [[Sydney]] and became known as the [[Sydney Swans]]. In the late 1980s strong interstate interest in the VFL led to a more national competition; two more non-Victorian clubs, the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the [[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane Bears]] began playing in 1987.\n\nThe league changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) following the 1989 season. In 1991, it gained its first South Australian team, [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]]. West Coast's [[local derby]] rival [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] was admitted in 1995. The Fitzroy Lions merged with Brisbane Bears after 1996 due to financial difficulties to form the [[Brisbane Lions]] and the proud old SANFL club, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] joined in 1997 as Port Adelaide Power, immediately becoming fierce local rivals to Adelaide. In 2011 The Gold Coast Suns were admitted into the league followed by the Greater Western Sydney Giants (GWS) in 2012. The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and the most powerful body in the world of Australian rules football.\n\n===Today's state leagues===\nFor much of the 20th century, the SANFL and the WAFL were considered peers of the VFL. Although the VFL was generally accepted as the strongest league, they frequently played each other on an even footing in challenge matches and occasional nationwide club competitions. The other states and territories also infrequently participated in interstate matches when they were able to field a strong side.\n\nWith the introduction of the AFL the SANFL, WAFL and other state leagues rapidly declined to a secondary status. Apart from these there are many semi-professional and amateur leagues around Australia, where they play a very important role in the community, and particularly so in rural areas.\n\nThe VFA, still in existence a century after the original schism, merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998. The new entity adopted the VFL name.\n\n===Australian football internationally===\n{{main|Australian football around the world}}\n\n[[File:Linkbelt1999-Finalspiel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Action from an Aussie Rules game in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]] at the [[Linkbelt Oval]]]]\n\nAlmost as soon as the game was becoming established in Australia, it had spread to [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] in 1878. [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]] followed in the 1880s, with the help of Australian goldminers; they were augmented by soldiers during the [[Second Boer War]].\n\nIn 1888, a touring British [[rugby football|rugby]] team played 19 games of Australian rules against clubs in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia. The tourists, who had been hastily trained in the local code, played [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in front of 25,000 people &mdash;  a substantial crowd at the time &mdash; in their first game. They even had a win over [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]]. However, the tourists returned to rugby once they left Australia and the foundation of Australian rules clubs overseas was still many years away.\n\nAs the game spread to New Zealand the national governing body the Australian Football Council became known as the Australasian Football Council then changed back after the game declined in popularity in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1908, New Zealand was home to a formidable league of 115 clubs, and their national team defeated both New South Wales and Queensland at the [[1908 Melbourne Carnival|Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival]], an event held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football. The game was also introduced to [[Australian rules football in England|England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]]. The profound effects of [[World War I]] caused the gradual demise in the game in countries outside Australia, including New Zealand.\n\nThe first nation outside of Australia to take the sport up seriously was the former Australian territory of [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], which began playing in the 1930s.  The game is now the national sport of the country. Another former territory, [[Australian rules football in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] began playing in the 1950s.  For a time at least, it was the most popular sport in the country, and still remains popular. [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] resumed a local competition in 1974.\n\nThe first ever international match involving Australia was played in 1977 at under 17 level between Australia and Papua New Guinea in Adelaide, with Australia taking the honours [https://web.archive.org/web/20120210120902/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/1977_to_1980.htm]. Since then, Australia have been peerless in the sport and seldom compete at international level.\n\nIn the late 1980s, as distance became less of an obstacle, amateur teams were established in [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]] (1987) and [[Australian rules football in England|England]], [[Denmark]] and [[Australian rules football in Canada|Canada]] (1989).   In the 1990s, amateur competition has grown in countries such as [[Sweden]] (1993), [[Germany]] (1995), [[Australian rules football in the United States|USA]] (1996), [[Argentina]], [[Spain]] and [[Samoa]] (1997), [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]] (1998), as well as a number of solely expatriate teams, mainly based in [[South East Asia]].\n\nSince 2000, fledgeling competitions have been established in countries such as [[Ireland]] (2000), [[Tonga]] (2002), [[Scotland]], [[France]] and [[China]] (2005), [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]] (2006), [[Catalonia]], [[Norway]] and [[East Timor]]. Many of these were initially established by Australian expatriates but collecting growing numbers of native players. In other countries, it grew out of AFL exhibition matches, cult television following or Internet communication.  [[North America]]n fans formed an organization, [[AFANA]], specifically to work for improved media coverage of Australian football.\n\nSince the 1990s, the AFL and other development bodies have contributed to the development the game overseas. There are now youth development programs in several of these countries; since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the AFL as part of its International Policy, has hosted several of junior teams from other countries.\n\nThe [[Arafura Games]], held in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]], Australia is a [[Multi-sport event]] for [[South East Asia]] and [[East Asia]]n island nations, northern Australia and the [[Pacific Islands]] which has Australian football as a permanent competition sport, rather than a [[demonstration sport]]. Papua New Guinea won the [[gold medal]] and retained it in subsequent games. Other teams that have competed at Australian Rules in the games include Japan, Nauru and a Northern Territory [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] team.\n\nThe [[International Australian Football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after the 1995 Arafura Games. Following internal divisions in the IAFC, another organization, [[Aussie Rules International]] was set up in [[London]]. The AFL did not recognise the IAFC as anything more than a promotional body, and is itself considered the keeper of the code. Hence the AFL is primarily responsible for funding and governance and provides around [[Australian dollar|A$]]500,000 annually for international development, especially junior programs. The code is not large enough outside Australia for an international [[sport governing body|governing body]] made up of national bodies.\n\nInspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was held in Melbourne in 2002, an initiative of the IAFC and the AFL. With the closure of the IAFC subsequent cups are staged by the AFL.  The 2002 cup was contested by 11 teams from around the world made up exclusively of non-Australians. [[Ireland]] won the 2002 cup, defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final. (See also: [[List of Australian rules football leagues outside Australia|Australian football leagues outside Australia]].)\n\nToday, Australian football is a major spectator sport in Australia and [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], although occasional [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition games]] are staged in other countries.  Some local grand final and carnival type events in [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Nauru]], [[England]] and the [[United States]] have occasionally drawn attendances that number in the thousands.\n\nOn 3 July 2006 the AFL announced that it had formed an International Development Committee to support overseas (non-Australian) football leagues. The AFL also hope to develop the game in other countries to the point where Australian football is played at an international level by top-quality sides from around the world. The AFL has hosted an International Cup regularly every three years, beginning in 2002, with the third game in 2008 corresponding to the 150th anniversary of the code.<ref>[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=2006063006252654 AFL International Development plans] at www.worldfootynews.com.</ref>\n\n====International rules football====\n{{main|International rules football}}\n\nSince 1967, there have been many matches between Australian and Irish teams, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules drawn from both Australian and [[Gaelic football]].

The band currently consist of lead vocalist Dave Faber, lead guitarist Jordan Pritchett, bass guitarist Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle and drummer Seamus O'Neill.\n\n==Biography==\nFaber Drive is a four-piece Juno Award-nominated Canadian rock band from Mission, British Columbia. They have toured with bands such as Hedley, Stereos, Marianas Trench, Simple Plan and Metro Station. They have gained a huge amount of popularity in many parts of Canada. Already well known for a local fan base, Faber Drive released a limited-edition three-song EP under the band name Faber. Due to legal issues, the band changed their name to Faber Drive.\n\nDiscovered by [[Chad Kroeger]] of [[Nickelback]] and signed to his [[604 Records]] label, Faber Drive released their debut album ''Seven Second Surgery'' on May 1, 2007, which was followed by the release of four singles. The band's biggest influences are [[U2]], [[The Police]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Stryper]] and [[Winger (band)|Winger]]. The band also featured in the American drama television series ''[[Kyle XY]]''. Two of their songs, \"Killin' Me\" and \"Summer Fades to Fall\", had featured in the show. The band also made an appearance in episode 3.01, \"Psychic Friend\", which aired on January 19, 2009. The band's lead singer Dave Faber is married to Ricarda Faber and has four kids\u2014Faith, David Dayton, Patience and Isaiah.\n\n==Name==\nThe band got their name when Faber and Red were driving and Faber was playing guitar behind the wheel and drove through a red light. Red then said \"Faber drive!\", thus giving them the name Faber Drive. After winning the Fox Seeds competition, they changed their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues. One of the names they considered before electing Faber Drive was Seven Second Surgery, but they decided it made a better album title than band name.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nFaber taught \"Red\" how to play drums for a while and asked him if he wanted to audition for his band. Hinsley was referred to Faber by his brother. At first, Dave thought he wasn't what he was looking for. A couple days later, Hinsley invited Faber for some beverages and they just connected. Dave found his lead guitarist. Red and Faber saw Krikit playing bass at an Easter service at the local church. Faber gave him his number, Krikit thought he was trying to make him come to church more often but he was going to stop coming because he had started drinking and didn't feel it was right. When he found out Faber and Red weren't from the church he was overwhelmed. He learned all the songs and played without hesitation three days before the band's first gig. Since then, they have opened for bands such as Nickelback, Hedley and Simple Plan.\n\n===Early years and rise to fame===\nAfter forming Faber, Dave would sign to Chad Kroeger of Nickelback's 604 Records label and hook up with [[Joey Moi]] for pre-production and Brian Howes to co-write with Faber. They then joined Fox's Battle of the Bands and would eventually win. After the band's triumph, they released a [[Faber (EP)|limited edition self-titled EP]]. They would later change their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues and would go on tour to promote their debut album titled ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''. Some concerts were partially taped on camera by band members and posted on YouTube. They would release three singles and music videos from ''Seven Second Surgery''. In April 2008, Ray was married and decided to leave the band. Calvin \"Poncho\" Lechner would join Faber Drive's line up and replace Red. They would later release a fourth single titled \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\", concerning a child's point of view of his parents fighting. In the summer of 2008, David Hinsley quit the band. Zubin Thakkar from the band Prize Fighter would come in to replace Hinsley and play in concerts until Faber Drive's last show in October 2008.\n\n===''Seven Second Surgery''===\nFaber Drive's debut album, ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]'', was released on May 1, 2007. Four singles were released from ''Seven Second Surgery'': \"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\", \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\", \"[[When I'm with You (Faber Drive song)|When I'm with You]]\", and \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\" (featuring Brian Melo). While \"Second Chance\" and \"Tongue Tied\" had successful chart positions in the west of Canada, \"When I'm with You\" had its best chart positions in the east.\n\n===''Can't Keep a Secret''===\nThe band's second album, ''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]'', was released on November 10, 2009. Lead single \"[[G-Get Up and Dance]]\" was produced by Faber, [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) and Colin \"Crocker\" Friesen. The single premiered on July 13, 2009, and became available on iTunes on July 21, 2009. Guitarist Jordan Pritchett, son of country singer [[Aaron Pritchett]], and drummer Andrew Stricko joined and replaced Hinsley and Lechner. \"G-Get Up and Dance\" went Gold after 5 weeks, reached number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n===''Lost in Paradise''===\nThe band released their third studio album, ''Lost in Paradise'', on August 28, 2012. Since the album's release, Faber Drive has shot and released music videos for the songs \"Do It in Hollywood\", \"Candy Store\" and \"Life Is Waiting\". And before they released their new single \"Life Is Waiting\", [[Andrew Stricko]] left the band and Seamus O'Neill replaced him. The band headed across Canada on the successful Lost in Paradise tour in Fall/Winter 2012. They have since visited [[Singapore]] to perform two shows for Music Matters and performed at some music festivals during the summer of 2013. They have since released two more singles from their third studio album, \"Too Little Too Late\" (featuring [[Pierre Bouvier]] of [[Simple Plan]]) and \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" (featuring Proper Villains). But the Music Videos are still not made. Therefore, the Official Lyric Video of \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" is already made by [[Warner Music Philippines]]. Note: (The single \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" [featuring Proper Villains] is the promotional single in Philippines).\n\n===2014 to present===\nIn April 2014, Faber Drive announced that they would play at Spring Fest 2014 at Kal Tire Place in Vernon, British Columbia, featuring [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Karl Wolf]], [[JRDN]] and [[These Kids Wear Crowns]]. On May 23, 2014, the show was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Simple Plan toured with Faber Drive in June 2014 in Kirkland Lake, Canada, marking Faber Drive's last show of 2014. They later released two demos from their fourth album, \"The Best of Me\" and \"Gonna Make It\". On July 24, 2015, the band held an acoustic mini-show at Highstreet in Abbotsford, British Columbia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn January 2016, Faber Drive posted on their official Facebook account that they would have new exciting things possibly happening that year. Then, they started to post some photos from their past concerts and music videos from their previous albums. Six months later, the band posted a photo that Dave is already back in the studio and they hinted that they would release new music shortly. On December 4, 2016, they held a reunion concert with their friends and special guests at the Hard Rock Casino in Vancouver. Following this, they released a Christmas song called \"We 3 Kings\". On March 13, 2017, they released new demos from their upcoming album \u2015 \"More Than Perfect\",\"Without\",\"Without a Fight\", \"One Million\" and \"Done My Best\". On August 5, 2018, they released a new single called \"Surrender\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current members===\n*Dave Faber \u2013 lead vocals, guitar <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle \u2013 bass, vocals <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jordan \"JP\" Pritchett \u2013 lead guitar, vocals <small>(2008\u2013present)</small>\n*Seamus O'Neill \u2013 drums, vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n\n===Former members===\n*Ray 'red' Bull \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*David Hinsley \u2013 [[lead guitar]], backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*Calvin Lechner \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n*[[Andrew Stricko]] \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2009\u20132012)</small>\n\n===Touring members===\n* Zubin Thakkar \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n* Simon Nagel \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Faber Drive discography}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|May 1, 2007\n|''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"| [[604 Records]]\n|-\n|November 10, 2009\n|''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]''\n|-\n|August 28, 2012\n|''[[Lost in Paradise (Faber Drive album)|Lost in Paradise]]''\n|}\n\n===EP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Faber (EP)|Faber]]''\n| [[604 Records]]\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n| 2007 || \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\" || [[SOCAN]] No. 1 Song Award || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2008 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\" || Canadian Radio Music Awards for Best New Group (Hot A/C) of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Juno Awards|Juno]] for Best New Group of the Year || {{nom}}\n|-\n{{end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Faber Drive discography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/faberdrivetv Faber Drive TV] on [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.faberdrivefreaks.ning.com Official Faber Drive Street Team]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Faber Drive}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian pop punk groups]]\n[[Category:People from Mission, British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in British Columbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian pop punk band}}\n{{Redirect|Ray Bull|the British psychologist|Ray Bull (psychologist)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = \n| background      = group_or_band\n| image           = [[File:Faberdrivenow.jpg|250 px]]\n| caption         = Faber Drive in 2011.
