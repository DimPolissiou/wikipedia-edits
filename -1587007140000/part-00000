After the departures of Ram\u00edrez and [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]], the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], who helped the team win the Central division with a 91\u201371 record.  One of the highlights came on August 5, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14\u20132 deficit in the seventh inning to defeat the [[2001 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 15\u201314 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won an MLB record-tying 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager [[Charlie Manuel]] had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly out of reach.\n\nSeattle and Cleveland met in the [[2001 American League Division Series|first round of the postseason]], however the Mariners won the series 3\u20132. In the 2001\u201302 offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant, [[Mark Shapiro (sports executive)|Mark Shapiro]], took the reins.\n\n===2002\u20132010: The Shapiro/Wedge years===\n[[File:Mark Shapiro.png|upright|thumb|[[Mark Shapiro (sports executive)|Mark Shapiro]] \u2013 Indians GM from 2001\u20132010,  President from 2010\u20132015, and two-time [[Sporting News Executive of the Year Award|Sporting News Executive of the Year]].]]\n\n====First \"rebuilding of the team\"====\nShapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent.

[[Jim Thome]] left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract.\n\nYoung Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and {{MLBy|2003}} under new manager [[Eric Wedge]]. They posted strong offensive numbers in {{MLBy|2004}}, but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 22\u20130 victory over the [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240831110 |title=Vizquel's six hits tie AL record |accessdate=2008-06-08 |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-08-31}}</ref>\n\nIn early {{MLBy|2005}}, the offense got off to a poor start.

Prior to 1997, the winner of the cup was determined by an annual [[spring training|pre-season]] baseball game, played each year at minor-league [[Cooper Stadium]] in the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and staged just days before the start of each new [[Major League Baseball]] season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, with the Indians winning six of them. It ended with the start of [[interleague play]] in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.\n\nSince 1997, the two teams have played each other as part of the regular season, with the exception of 2002. The Ohio Cup was reintroduced in 2008 and is presented to the team who wins the most games in the series that season. Initially, the teams played one three-game series per season, meeting in Cleveland in 1997 and Cincinnati the following year. Since 1999, the teams have played two series per season against each other, one at each ballpark. Since 2013, each series is two games, except in years when the AL & NL Central divisions meet interleague play, it is extended to three.<ref>{{cite news |title=On schedule: New Interleague format brings twists |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/48380512/on-schedule-new-interleague-format-brings-twists |author=Schlegel, John |date=May 23, 2013 |work=MLB.com |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref> Through the 2019 meetings, the Indians lead the series 63\u201350.<ref>{{cite web |title=Head-to-Head results for Cleveland Indians vs. Cincinnati Reds from 1901 to 2018 |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head-games.cgi?team1=CLE&team2=CIN&from=1901&to=2019 |work=Baseball-Reference.com |year=2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref>\n\n===Divisional===\nAs the Indians play 19 games every year with each of their AL Central competitors, several rivalries have developed.\n\nThe Indians have a geographic rivalry with the [[Detroit Tigers]], highlighted in recent years by intense battles for the AL Central title.  The match up has some carryover elements from the [[Ohio State-Michigan rivalry]], as well as the general historic rivalry between Michigan and Ohio dating back to the [[Toledo War]].\n\nThe [[Chicago White Sox]] are another rival, dating back to the 1959 season, when the Sox slipped past the Tribe to win the AL pennant. The rivalry intensified when both clubs were moved to the new AL Central in 1994.  During that season, the two teams challenged for the division title, with the Indians one game back of Chicago when the strike began in August. During a game in Chicago, the White Sox confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s corked bat, followed by an attempt by Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] to crawl through the [[Comiskey Park II|Comiskey Park]] clubhouse ceiling to retrieve it. Belle later signed with the White Sox in 1997, adding additional intensity to the rivalry.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n{{See also|Major League Baseball uniforms}}\n\nFor the first time in over 70 years, the Indians featured uniforms without the Chief Wahoo logo in 2019, with the official team colors being red, navy blue, and white.<ref name=\"IndiansUniformPlan\">{{cite news|last=Berry|first=Adam|title=Indians adjust uniform plan for 2017|url=https://www.mlb.com/indians/news/indians-adjust-uniforms-for-2017/c-211201118|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Indians.com|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=Major League Baseball and the Cleveland Indians unveil the official logo of the 2019 All-Star Game presented by Mastercard|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-indians-unveil-official-logo-of-2019-all-star-game-presented-by-mastercard/c-289267376|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=August 7, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018|quote=The official logo of the 2019 All-Star Game celebrates the rich culture of Cleveland.

It was a revival of the nickname that fans gave to the [[Cleveland Spiders]] while [[Louis Sockalexis]], a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], was playing for the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=The early years\u2013Indians History Overview|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/history/cle_history_overview.jsp|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=Indians.com|accessdate=March 23, 2016|quote=The Naps lost a then franchise record 102 games in 1914 and attendance sank to disastrous lows as the Lajoie era in Cleveland came to a close. Lajoie's departure, following the 1914 season, prompted a name change for the Cleveland franchise. On January 17, two Cleveland newspapers (''The Leader'' and ''The Plain Dealer'') reported that Indians had been chosen to replace Naps. ''The Plain Dealer'' said, \"President Somers invited the Cleveland baseball writers to make the selection. The title of Indians was their choice, it having been one of the names applied to the old National League club of Cleveland many years ago.\" When Chief Sockalexis first arrived, baseball in Cleveland suffered an abrupt downturn in fortune. Now, the Indians would rise to glory with a new owner and star player.}}</ref>  Common [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknames]] for the Indians include the \"Tribe\" and the \"Wahoos\", the latter referencing their former logo, [[Chief Wahoo]]. The team's mascot is named \"Slider.\"\n\nThe franchise originated in 1894 as the '''Grand Rapids Rustlers''', a minor league team in the [[Western League (1885\u20131899)|Western League]].

One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901]]. Originally called the '''Cleveland Bluebirds''', the team played in [[League Park]] until moving permanently to [[Cleveland Stadium]] in [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. At the end of the 2019 season, they had a regular season franchise record of {{Win-loss record|w=9,477|l=9,037}} ({{winpct|9477|9037}}).

Ultimately, two of the league's western clubs went out of business during the first season and the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire|Chicago Fire]] left that city's [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] impoverished, unable to field a team again until [[1874 in baseball|1874]]. Cleveland was thus the NA's westernmost outpost in [[1872 in baseball|1872]], the year the club folded. Cleveland played its full schedule to July 19 followed by two games versus Boston in mid-August and disbanded at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1872 Cleveland Forest Citys |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1872/TCL101872.htm |publisher=retrosheet.org}}</ref>\n\n;1879\u20131881 Cleveland Forest Citys\n;1882\u20131884 Cleveland Blues\n\nIn [[1876 in baseball|1876]], the [[National League]] (NL) supplanted the NA as the major professional league.

The fence moved as much as {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season.  The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game.  On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the [[1948 World Series|World Series]] against the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] drew over 84,000. The record stood until the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] drew a crowd in excess of 92,500 to watch Game 5 of the [[1959 World Series]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] against the [[Chicago White Sox]].\n\nUnder Veeck's leadership, one of Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in the [[American League]] by signing [[Larry Doby]], formerly a player for the Negro League's [[Newark Eagles]] in {{Baseball year|1947}}, 11 weeks after [[Jackie Robinson]] signed with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]].<ref name=Borsvold/>  Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season.

At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black pitcher. Paige ended the year with a 6\u20131 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two shutouts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1948.shtml |title= Satchel Paige 1948 Statistics|accessdate=2008-06-28 |website=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>\n\n[[File:LouBoudreau1953bowman.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Lou Boudreau]], 1948 American League MVP]]\nIn {{MLBy|1948}}, veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and [[Joe Gordon]] had career offensive seasons, while newcomers Doby and [[Gene Bearden]] also had standout seasons.

Prior to 1997, the winner of the cup was determined by an annual [[spring training|pre-season]] baseball game, played each year at minor-league [[Cooper Stadium]] in the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and staged just days before the start of each new [[Major League Baseball]] season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, with the Indians winning six of them. It ended with the start of [[interleague play]] in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.\n\nSince 1997, the two teams have played each other as part of the regular season, with the exception of 2002. The Ohio Cup was reintroduced in 2008 and is presented to the team who wins the most games in the series that season. Initially, the teams played one three-game series per season, meeting in Cleveland in 1997 and Cincinnati the following year. Since 1999, the teams have played two series per season against each other, one at each ballpark.

The match up has some carryover elements from the [[Ohio State-Michigan rivalry]], as well as the general historic rivalry between Michigan and Ohio dating back to the [[Toledo War]].\n\nThe [[Chicago White Sox]] are another rival, dating back to the 1959 season, when the Sox slipped past the Tribe to win the AL pennant. The rivalry intensified when both clubs were moved to the new AL Central in 1994.  During that season, the two teams challenged for the division title, with the Indians one game back of Chicago when the strike began in August. During a game in Chicago, the White Sox confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s corked bat, followed by an attempt by Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] to crawl through the [[Comiskey Park II|Comiskey Park]] clubhouse ceiling to retrieve it.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.<ref name=\"Taycc\">{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|work=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref> A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

One study finds that, \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses.\"<ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|title = Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal = Demography|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 0070-3370|pages = 739\u2013763|volume = 46|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/dem.0.0076|pmid = 20084827|first = Carolyn|last = Moehling|first2 = Anne Morrison|last2 = Piehl|pmc = 2831353}}</ref>\n\nFor the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had \"quite similar\" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for major crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930.<ref name=\":28\" /> Contemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable ways.<ref name=\":28\" /> A study by Harvard economist [[Nathan Nunn]], Yale economist [[Nancy Qian]] and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131920) had no long-run effects on crime rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Sandra|last2=Nunn|first2=Nathan|last3=Qian|first3=Nancy|date=March 2017 |title=Migrants and the Making of America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Immigration during the Age of Mass Migration |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23289 |doi=10.3386/w23289 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Terrorism ====\nAccording to a review by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fact-checker of the available research and evidence, there is nothing to support President Trump's claim that \"the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.\"<ref name=\":48\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/15/president-trumps-claim-that-foreigners-comprise-the-vast-majority-of-terrorism-convictions-since-911/|title=Analysis {{!}} President Trump's claim that foreigners are responsible for 'the vast majority' of terrorism convictions since 9/11|last=|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> The fact-checker noted that the Government Accountability Office had found that \"of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since Sept. 12, 2001, 73 percent (62) were committed by far-right-wing violent extremist groups, and 27 percent (23) by radical Islamist violent extremists\".<ref name=\":48\" /> A bulletin by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security also warned in May 2017 that white supremacist groups were \u201cresponsible for a lion\u2019s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups\".<ref name=\":48\" /> According to a report by the [[New America (organization)|New America]] foundation, of the individuals credibly involved in radical Islamist-inspired activity in the United States since 9/11, the large majority were US-born citizens, not immigrants.<ref name=\":48\" />\n\nA 2018 paper found no statistically significant evidence that refugee settlements in the United States are linked to terrorism events.<ref name=\":54\" />\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\n{{Further|Immigration to Australia|Crime in Australia}}\n\nA 2019 study found no impact of immigration on crime rates in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sydes|first=Michelle|date=2019-09-18|title=Immigration, Ethnicity, and Neighborhood Violence: Considering Both Concentration and Diversity Effects|journal=Race and Justice|language=en-US|pages=215336871987518|doi=10.1177/2153368719875183|issn=2153-3687}}</ref> Foreigners are under-represented in the Australian prison population, according to 2010 figures.<ref name=\":34\" /> A 1987 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that studies had consistently found that migrant populations in Australia had lower crime rates than the Australian-born population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/archive/migration-ethnicity-and-crime-in-australian-society|title=Migration, ethnicity and crime in Australian society|last=Hazlehurst|first=Kayleen|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe alleged link between immigration and criminality has been a longstanding meme in Australian history with many of the original immigrants being convicts. During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.<ref name=\"Taycc\">{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|work=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref> A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.
