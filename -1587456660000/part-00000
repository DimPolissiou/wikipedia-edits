football|1998\u201399 season]], Leeds United competed in the Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons).\n\n==Season summary==\nLeeds were expected to progress once more under manager George Graham after the former Arsenal manager guided Leeds to 5th place in his first full season in charge, Graham had added to his squad signing defender Danny Granville and dutch striker Clyde Winjard and after just 4 games Leeds went top of the Premiership for the first time in their history but rumours then begun of George Graham taking the Tottenham job after Spurs had sacked Christian Gross, the saga dragged on when finally after a UEFA cup game against Maritimo of Portugal Graham indeed left Leeds for Tottenham, Grahams assistant David O'leary took charge while Leeds attempted to attract Leicester boss Martin O'Neil (who eventually refused) but United performances on the pitch begun improving -despite only drawing several games, many teenage players were given debuts by O'Leary and put in great performances including against Italian giants Roma in the UEFA cup although Leeds were knocked out, needless to say O'Leary was appointed manager in time for the game against Derby which ended 2-2, Leeds then begun winning regularly playing impressive attacking football with several talented youngsters including goal keeper Paul Robinson, defenders Ian Harte, Johnathan Woodgate, Mid fielders Lee Bowyer (who was signed from Charlton 2 seasons before) Steven McPhail, along with strikers Alan Smith and Harry Kewell but David O'leary was eager bring in experienced players to add to this young team and signed David Batty from Newcastle, Batty was a key player in the Leeds side that won the old division 1 title in 1992 and a fans favourite, in the run up to X mas Leeds were almost in contention for a shot at the title but in the new year suffered back to back losses against Southampton and Newcastle which ended any league-winning hopes and were also knocked out of the FA cup, despite this Leeds ended the season in red hot form setting a record of 7 straight wins and a 1-0 victory over Arsenal which cost the gunners the title race, Leeds finished an impressive 4th place in the league -they're highest finish yet and with one of the most exiting young squads in the country the future certainly looked bright for United.\n\n==Final league

Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons).\n\n==Season summary==\nLeeds were expected to progress once more under manager George Graham after the former Arsenal manager guided Leeds to 5th place in his first full season in charge, Graham had added to his squad signing defender Danny Granville and dutch striker Clyde Winjard and after just 4 games Leeds went top of the Premiership for the first time in their history but rumours then begun of George Graham taking the Tottenham job after Spurs had sacked Christian Gross, the saga dragged on when finally after a UEFA cup game against Maritimo of Portugal Graham indeed left Leeds for Tottenham, Grahams assistant David O'leary took charge while Leeds attempted to attract Leicester boss Martin O'Neil (who eventually refused) but United performances on the pitch begun improving -despite only drawing several games, many teenage players were given debuts by O'Leary and put in great performances including against Italian giants Roma in the UEFA cup although Leeds were knocked out, needless to say O'Leary was appointed manager in time for the game against Derby which ended 2-2, Leeds then begun winning regularly playing impressive attacking football with several talented youngsters including goal keeper Paul Robinson, defenders Ian Harte, Johnathan Woodgate, Mid fielders Lee Bowyer (who was signed from Charlton 2 seasons before) Steven McPhail, along with strikers Alan Smith and Harry Kewell but David O'leary was eager bring in experienced players to add to this young team and singed David Batty from Newcastle, Batty was a key player in the Leeds side that won the old division 1 title in 1992 and a fans favourite, in the run up to X mas Leeds were almost in contention for a shot at the title but in the new year suffered back to back losses against Southampton and Newcastle which ended any league-winning hopes and were also knocked out of the FA cup, despite this Leeds ended the season in red hot form setting a record of 7 straight wins and a 1-0 victory over Arsenal which cost the gunners the title race, Leeds finished an impressive 4th place in the league -they're highest finish yet and with one of the most exiting young squads in the country the future certainly looked bright for United.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1998\u201399 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1998\u201399 FA Premier

The battle ended in a French victory when ''Quebec'' was destroyed by an explosion.\n\n== Background ==\n\nFrance along with Spain joined on the side of the Americans and war was declared between France and Britain. Britain did not attempt a [[Blockade#Close, distant, and loose blockades|close blockade]] of French ports, rather a screen of frigates kept a vigil while the [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] stayed at anchor at places like [[Torbay]] and [[Spithead]]. One of those frigates, operating off [[Guernsey]], was the thirty-two gun, twelve-pounder frigate HMS ''Quebec'' under [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Farmer (Royal Navy officer)|George Farmer]]. ''Quebec'' had run aground on a submerged rock and had to throw excess weight overboard to refloat her, sacrificing his 12-pound cannon. When repaired in [[Portsmouth]] there were no replacements at the time, so ship and crew went back out on station armed with only nine pounders.\n\nOn 6 October,  ''Quebec'' working with the [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] HMS ''Rambler'' of ten guns spotted a frigate and a cutter. By 8:00&nbsp;am they were found to be the French {{sclass-|Iphig\u00e9nie|frigate|0}}, 32-gun {{ship|French frigate|Surveillante|1778|2}}, under captain Cou\u00ebdic de Kergoaler and the cutter [[French corvette Exp\u00e9dition (1778)|''Exp\u00e9dition'']].<ref name=autogenerated1>Hennequin p. 101</ref>\n\n{{Gallery \n |title=Portraits of the commanders\n |align=center\n |File:George Farmer by Charles Grignion.jpg|Captain George Farmer by [[Charles Grignion the Younger]]\n |File:Charles du Cou\u00ebdic mg 8131.jpg|Charles du Cou\u00ebdic at [[Brest, France|Brest]] Mus\u00e9e national de Marine\n}}\n== Engagement ==\n''Quebec'' cleared for action and by 8:30 in the light wind the French frigate had opened fire. Within an hour ''Quebec'' opened fire after she became parallel with ''Surveillante''. Initially ''Quebec'' had the upper hand but ''Surveillante'' matched ''Quebec''{{'}}s every move, and from 10&nbsp;am until 1&nbsp;pm both sides battered each other furiously. Soon casualties and damages to the respective ships began to take their toll. Farmer was wounded as was the [[First lieutenant#Royal Navy|first lieutenant]] who had to have his arm amputated after part of it was shot away and remarkably soon went back to duty. Cou\u00ebdic was wounded twice within two hours but not seriously when all of ''Surveillante''{{'}}s [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and rigging progressively crashed down. ''Quebec'' seeing an opportunity was about to finish the French ship but her severely damaged and weakened masts all came down within a space of a half an hour. ''Quebec''{{'}}s main and foremasts went over the disengaged side, but the mizzen mast came down on the engagement side blocking many of the gunports with the sails and rigging.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>Carruthers p. 128</ref>\n\nThe ships drifted together with ''Surveillante''{{'}}s bowsprit becoming entangled in the wreckage of ''Quebec''{{'}}s mizzen mast. ''Quebec''{{'}}s gun captains kept up her rate of fire by shooting through the wreckage. Cou\u00ebdic saw his opportunity to board and take ''Quebec'' but they were repulsed with heavy losses including Cou\u00ebdic who had now an additional third wound.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy now a stalemate had ensued; both sides' priority was now taken to sorting the damage and casualties were heavy. However, a turn of events began: a fire had begun on ''Quebec''{{'}}s mangled and tangled sails covering the gun ports, as a result of cannon fire. The fire soon spread out of control and soon took a hold of ''Surveillante''. Cou\u00ebdic though managed to break free of ''Quebec'' by chopping off the wreckage that entangled both ships, and the fire on the French ship was brought under control.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, on ''Quebec'' the situation was serious; the fire had spread within the ship itself and had become totally uncontrollable.  Farmer ordered the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] to be flooded but this was now futile, and by 6&nbsp;pm the fire reached the magazine. British sailors jumped into the water as some knew the inevitable would happen. Farmer ordered the ship to be abandoned and panic ensued. Within moments ''Quebec'' exploded taking whatever was left of her complement including Farmer himself. ''Surveillante'' managed to be out of harm's way but was so badly shot up the vessel did not have a boat that was seaworthy and could only throw ropes to those sailors (those that could swim) that managed to get close to her.\n\nThe cutters had fought their own separate battle and they too had battered themselves into submission. When ''Quebec'' exploded the task of rescuing survivors became a priority; the French cutter ''Exp\u00e9dition'' broke off the engagement and helped as best she could. The British cutter ''Rambler'' had her sails and rigging so badly damaged she was unable to pursue or even intervene; she sent out a boat instead to help.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated3>Clark p. 131</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOne of the difficulties in rescuing the crew was the heavy swell as well as the light wind. ''Rambler''{{'}}s boat saved a [[master's mate]], two [[midshipmen]] and fourteen sailors, while ''Surveillante'' saved the First Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant of [[Royal Marines|marines]], the surgeon and 36 of the crew. 13 more were saved by a passing Russian ship.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThe damage to ''Surveillante'' was severe, her hull was leaking and had 30 killed and 85 wounded. British and French sailors then had to work together to keep her afloat, and in that they were successful. She returned to Brest the next day under a [[jury rig]]. Cou\u00ebdic and the rest of the French crew treated the surviving British as castaways found at sea, not as prisoners of war, seeing them repatriated without parole or exchange. Cou\u00ebdic died of his wounds in January 1780, and was admired for his courage and compassion by both the French and the British.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> ''Surveillante'' took nearly a year for repairs to be complete and went on to fight in American waters and even brought news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|peace in Paris]] in company with the British frigate ''Medea'' in the summer of 1783.\n\n===Art===\nNumerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by Auguste-Louis Rossel de Cercy (a key exhibit of the [[Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine]] in [[Paris]]), by [[George Carter (artist)|George Carter]] (of which a print is dedicated to [[George&nbsp;III]], the King of England) and by [[Robert Dodd (artist)|Robert Dodd]].\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Bataille surveillante quebec.jpg |Early part of the engagement.

However, following a [[1932 Irish general election|change of government in 1932]] and the adoption of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] a series of amendments progressively removed many of the provisions that had been required by the Treaty.\n\nThe Constitution established a [[parliamentary system]] of government under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], and contained guarantees of certain [[fundamental rights]]. It was intended that the constitution would be a rigid document that, after an initial period, could be amended only by [[referendum]]. However, amendments were made to the Constitution's amendment procedure, so that all amendments could be and were in fact made by a simple [[Act of Parliament|Act of the Oireachtas]] (parliament).\n\n==Background and enactment==\n\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2019}}<!--2 subsections have no footnotes-->\n\n===Debate on whether a written constitution was required===\n\nWhether or not the Irish Free State would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Bill was introduced to the Provisional Parliament by President Cosgrave.<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\"/> The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] leader, Thomas Johnson, remarked:\n\n{{quote|[T]here is no compulsion\u2014so far as I can read in the Treaty\u2014for a Constitution \u2014a written Constitution\u2014to be established at all.... It would be wiser, I suggest, to leave the enactment of a Constitution until there is something like quietude in the country.... I submit that it would be enough, in so far as any obligations that have been entered into, to re-enact, re-affirm, or ratify \u2013 whichever phrase you like \u2013 the Treaty itself, and let the Constitution grow out from that and thereby flatter our neighbours by following their own practice, in allowing the Constitution to develop by custom and usage.|source=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate 18 September 1922<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\"/>}}\n\nAnother reason put forward not to adopt a written constitution was that constitutional conventions between members of the British Commonwealth were evolving and there was likely to be an Imperial Conference on the matter before long. The Labour leader also objected to the manner in which the Provisional Parliament was being described as a \"constituent assembly\" when in fact it was not acting of its \"free volition\" and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution.<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\">{{cite web|url = https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-09-18/30/ | publisher = Oireachtas.ie | work = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann Debate | date= 18 September 1922| title = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate - Monday, 18 Sep 1922 - Bill to Enact Constitution}}</ref> He compared it to re-establishing [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]].<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\"/>\n\nNonetheless, there were counter arguments in favour of adopting a written constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-09-21/9/ | publisher = Oireachtas.ie | work = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann Debate | date= 21 September 1922| title = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate - Thursday, 21 Sep 1922 - Constitution Debates Resumed}}</ref> Irish nationalists who fought the [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]] believed themselves to be fighting on behalf of a newly formed state called the [[Irish Republic]]. The Irish Republic had its own president, an elected assembly called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], and a judicial system in the form of the [[D\u00e1il Courts]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1920-06-29/25/ | publisher = Oireachtas.ie | work = D\u00e1il Record - Volume 1  | date= 29 June 1920 | title = Decrees - Courts Of Justice And Equity And Criminal Jurisdiction }}</ref> This republic was recognised by the revolutionary government in Russia. In the negotiations leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty the British government insisted that the new Irish state must remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and not be a republic. Furthermore, while the Irish Republic had a constitution, of sorts, in the form of the [[D\u00e1il Constitution]], this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional. It was therefore the prevalent view that when, in 1921, the British government agreed to the creation of a largely independent Irish state, that a new constitution was needed. The Anglo-Irish Treaty made a number of requirements of the new constitution. Among these were that:<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.difp.ie/docs/1921/Anglo-Irish-Treaty/214.htm | publisher = Royal Irish Academy | work = Documents on Irish Foreign Policy | date = 6 November 1921 | title = Document No. 214 DE 2/304/1 - Final text of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland as signed }}</ref>\n\n* the new state would be called the Irish Free State and would be a [[British Dominions|dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]];\n* the King would be the [[head of state]] and would be represented by a Governor General;\n* members of the Oireachtas (parliament) would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State and declare their fidelity to the King.  This [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Free State Oath of Allegiance]] was controversial; and\n* [[Northern Ireland]] would be included in the Irish Free State unless its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] decided to ''[[Partition of Ireland|opt out]]'' (which it did).\n\n===Legislative competence===\n\nOn 31 March 1922, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament called the [[Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922]] was passed. It gave the force of law to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. It also provided by for the election of a body to be called the \"House of the Parliament\", sometimes called the \"Provisional Parliament\", to which the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]] established under that act would be responsible. The act gave no power to the Provisional Parliament to enact a constitution for the Irish Free State.<ref name=\"Moore v Attorney General\"/> In due course, \"the House of the Parliament,\" provided for by that act, was elected and met on 9 September 1922, and calling itself D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the Constitution of the Irish Free State.\n\n===Constitution Committee===\n\nShortly after the British evacuated their troops from [[Dublin Castle]] in January 1922, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent Irish Free State which would come into being in December 1922.<ref>Address to the Constitutional Convention, Dublin Castle, 1 December 2012 by Gerard Hogan, judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court of Ireland]]</ref>  Mr Collins chaired the first meeting of that committee and at that point (he died before the constitution was finalised) was its chairman. [[Darrell Figgis]], the vice-chairman became acting Chair. The committee produced three draft texts, designated A, B and C. A was signed by Figgis, [[James McNeill]] and [[John O'Byrne]]. B was signed by [[James G. Douglas]], C.J. France and [[Hugh Kennedy]] and it differed substantially from A only in proposals regarding the Executive.<ref>Douglas p81</ref> This difference was intended by Douglas to permit the anti-treaty faction a say in the final proposed constitution before its submission to the British Government. As such it was, according to Douglas, an attempt to ameliorate the pro- and anti-treaty split. Draft C was the most novel of the three. It was signed by [[Alfred O'Rahilly]] and [[James Murnaghan]], and provided for the possibility of representation for the people of the northern counties in the D\u00e1il in the event of that area opting out of the proposed free state.<ref>Douglas p85</ref><br /> The Irish text was then drafted as a translation of the English text. The [[Irish language]] version was drafted by a committee which included the Minister for Education, [[Eoin MacNeill]]; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy speaker), [[P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille]]; the Clerk of the D\u00e1il, Colm \u00d3 Murchadha; [[Piaras B\u00e9asla\u00ed]]; [[Liam \u00d3 Rinn]] and Professors [[Osborn Bergin]] and [[T. F. O'Rahilly]].\n\n===Method of adoption===\n\nAs a practical matter, the process of drafting the constitution began with the establishment by Michael Collins of the committee to draft a new constitution. This started shortly after the Provisional Government was established in January 1922. In subsequent months members of the Provisional Government negotiated the draft constitution with the British authorities. After that process was completed, a bill entitled the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Bill'' was introduced into D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (the [[Third D\u00e1il]]) in September 1922, the D\u00e1il sitting as a \"constituent assembly\". It was enacted by the Third D\u00e1il on 25 October 1922.\n\nArticle 83 of the constitution provided that \"The passing and adoption of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament shall be announced as soon as may be, and not later than the sixth day of December, Nineteen hundred and twenty-two, by Proclamation of His Majesty, and this Constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such Proclamation.\"\n\nThe British Parliament then passed the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]], which came into force on 5 December 1922. This act recited that the House of Parliament constituted pursuant to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, sitting as a constituent assembly for the settlement of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, had passed the measure set forth in the schedule to the act, (namely the constitution adopted by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann), which it then referred to as \"the Constituent Act\". It then provided that the Constituent Act should be the Constitution of the Irish Free State and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by His Majesty in accordance with Article 83 of the constitution.\n\nThe Royal Proclamation bringing the constitution into force was made on 6 December 1922. Referring to the constitution as a \"Measure\" whereby the constitution appearing as the First Schedule to the Constituent Act was declared to be the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Royal Proclamation went on to \"announce and proclaim that the Constitution of the Irish Free State as the same was passed and adopted by the said Constituent Assembly has been passed and adopted by Parliament\". The 6 December 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] for the continued authority of the Provisional Government set up by the treaty pending \"the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State\". On this date also the members of the D\u00e1il took the Oath of Allegiance, and nominated the members of the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] (the cabinet).\n\n===Incorporation of the treaty===\n\nThe ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' contained two schedules. One schedule contained the new constitution, and the other the text of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. As enacted in 1922, Section 2 of the act provided for the supremacy of the treaty's provisions, voiding any part of the Constitution or other Free State law that was \"[[:wikt:repugnant|repugnant]]\" to it. Similarly, both Section 2 of the act and Article 50 of the constitution provided that no constitutional amendment would stand so far as it violated the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe enactment by the British Parliament of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 changed the legal framework as understood by the British.  The statute was designed to increase the legislative autonomy of all the dominions.  In contrast with certain of the other dominions, the statute did not specifically place any reservation on this power as exerciseable by the Free State, and thus granted it the power to alter Irish law in any way it chose.  The new government under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] soon used this new freedom to enact the ''Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933''. Besides abolishing the Oath of Allegiance, a requirement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the act also expressly repealed the provisions both of the constitution proper and of the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' that required compliance with the treaty.  Subsequent legislation soon began to dismantle other constitutional provisions that had been required or limited by the treaty's terms.\n\n===Constitution's authority===\n\nUnder British constitutional legal theory, the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' held the force of law because of the enactment of the United Kingdom's ''Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922''.  However, under Irish law the constitution \"derived its authority not from the Act of the imperial parliament passed on the 5th December, 1922, or from the proclamation made on the 6th December, 1922, but from the Act of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann sitting as a constituent assembly passed on the 25th October, 1922\".<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/(WebFiles)/4BDC71672260E0218025765E0036A4F4/$FILE/State%20(Ryan)%20v%20Lennon_1934.rtf ''The State (Ryan and Others) v.

The ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' consisted of only a short preamble and three short sections, but was a far longer document because, as noted above, it included as schedules the full text of both the constitution proper and the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\n\nThe articles of the Constitution proper were not grouped together under headings, save for the final ten articles (which came under the title of \"Transitory Provisions\"). However, divided by subject matter the articles of the Constitution broke down roughly as follows:\n{|\n|\n* Introductory provisions (Arts. 1\u20134)\n* Fundamental rights (Arts. 5\u201310)\n* Legislature (Arts. 13\u201346)\n** D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Arts. 26\u201329)\n** The Senate (Arts. 30\u201334)\n* Initiative and referendum (Arts. 47\u201348)\n|\n* Constitutional amendments (Art. 50)\n* Cabinet (Arts. 51\u201359)\n* Governor-General (Art. 60)\n* Regulation of state finances (Arts. 61\u201363)\n* Courts (Arts. 64\u201372)\n* Transitory Provisions (Arts. 73\u201383)\n|}\n\n===Preamble===\n\nThe constitution itself had no preamble. However the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' began with the following words:\n\n{{quote|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people and in the confidence that the National life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored, hereby proclaims the establishment of The Irish Free State (otherwise called Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) and in the exercise of undoubted right, decrees and enacts as follows:\u2014}}\n\n===Characteristics of the state===\n\n* '''Commonwealth membership:''' Article 1 stated that the state would be a \"co-equal member\" of the British Commonwealth.\n* '''Popular sovereignty:''' It was stated that the \"all powers of government... are derived from the people of Ireland\" (Article 2).\n* '''Citizenship:''' The constitution provided that those living in the state at the time of its coming into force who had been born in Ireland, had parents born in Ireland or had been resident in the state for seven years would become citizens. However anyone who was the citizen of another state could choose not to become an Irish citizen (Article 3).\n* '''National language''': It was provided that Irish was the \"National Language\" but English was \"equally recognised as an official language\" (Article 4). The constitution included the terms ''Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' (as one name for the Irish Free State), ''Oireachtas'' (for the legislature), and ''D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann'' and ''Seanad \u00c9ireann'' (for the houses of the legislature), all of which were intended for use even in English speech.\n\n===Individual rights===\n\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\n\nUnlike the then constitutions of Australia and Canada, the constitution included a [[bill of rights]], in Articles 6\u201310. Rights were also protected by a number of provisions contained in other articles.\n\n* '''Prohibition of titles of nobility''': It was provided that no title of honour, including [[knighthood]]s and [[peerage]]s, could be conferred on an Irish citizen without the consent of the Executive Council (Article 5). In practice this amounted to a complete ban.\n* '''Liberty and ''habeas corpus''''': Article 6 provided that no-one could be deprived of liberty except in accordance with the law, and that ''[[habeas corpus]]'' would be upheld. The military forces were granted an exemption from this article during time of war or rebellion.\n* '''Inviolability of the home''': The home could not be entered except in accordance with the law (Article 7).\n* '''Freedom of conscience and worship''': Protected by Article 9 subject to \"public order and morality\" (Article 8).\n* '''Prohibition of establishment''': The state could not \"endow\" any religion (Article 8).\n* '''Religious discrimination''': The state could not discriminate on religious grounds (Article 8).\n* '''Freedom of speech, assembly and association''': All guaranteed subject to \"public morality\". Laws regulating freedom of assembly and association could not be discriminatory (Article 9).\n* '''Right to education''': Free elementary education guaranteed to all citizens (Article 10).\n* '''Trial by jury''': Guaranteed by Article 72, which granted an exemption for minor offences and offences triable by [[court martial]].\n\nThe constitution empowered the courts to strike down laws they found to be unconstitutional. However judicial review of legislation was made largely meaningless by the ease with which the Oireachtas could alter the constitution. Furthermore, as the state had only recently seceded from the UK, Irish judges were trained in British jurisprudence. To this tradition, founded on deference to the legislature and [[parliamentary sovereignty]], constitutional review was an alien concept. This meant that despite the adoption of a new, more rigid constitution in 1937, constitutional review did not become a significant feature of Irish jurisprudence until the 1960s. During the entire period of the Free State, only two pieces of legislation were declared by the courts to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe Free State had significant problems with public order in early years. It was founded during the [[Irish Civil War]] which did not come to an end until May 1923, and thereafter there were continuing problems of public disorder and subversive activities by the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). This situation led to an erosion of civil rights in the new state. During the Civil War a law provided the death penalty for the crime of unlawful possession of a [[firearm]], and more than seventy people were executed for the offence. Strong security measures continued to be used after the war's conclusion; these included internment of former rebels and the punishment of [[flogging]] for arson and [[armed robbery]], introduced in 1924.\n\nIn 1931, acting in response to IRA violence, the Oireachtas adopted Amendment No. 17 of the constitution. This added a sweeping set of provisions called Article 2A to the constitution. Article 2A was very large, consisting of five parts and 34 sections. Among other provisions it granted powers of arrest, detention and trial of people before military tribunals not bound by normal rules of evidence, despite the fact that many crimes triable before the tribunals carried a mandatory death sentence. To protect itself from being undermined by the courts, Article 2A was drafted to state that it took precedence over all other provisions of the constitution (save Article 1).\n\nThe provisions for military tribunals were challenged in 1935 in the case of The State (Ryan) v. Lennon. In this case the majority of the Supreme Court reluctantly held that, because Amendment No. 17 had been duly adopted in accordance with the correct procedure, it was not open to the judges to strike it down. However Chief Justice Kennedy disagreed, arguing, in a dissenting opinion, that the Article 2A violated [[natural law]].\n\n===Organs of government===\n\nThe constitution provided for a parliamentary system of government. The legislature was called the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]], consisting of the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|monarch]] and two houses: the Chamber of Deputies, to be known generally as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], was established as the [[lower house]], and the Senate, to be known generally as [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad \u00c9ireann]], as the [[upper house]].<ref>Article 12, Constitution of the Irish Free State</ref> The Seanad had only limited powers of delay so the D\u00e1il was the dominant house.\n\nExecutive authority was vested in the King and exercised by the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]], who would appoint an [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] to \"aid and advise\" him. The Executive Council was headed by a prime minister, the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. In practice, however, the President was nominated by the D\u00e1il and formally appointed by the Governor-General. The President then nominated the remaining members of the Executive Council. The D\u00e1il was empowered to dismiss it by a [[vote of no confidence]]. With few exceptions, the Governor-General was required to act on the Executive Council's advice.\n\nThe constitution provided that the [[judiciary]] would consist of the [[Irish Free State Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], the High Court, and any lower courts established by law.\n\n===Initiative and referendum===\n\nAs originally adopted the constitution contained (in Articles 47, 48 and 50) innovative provisions for [[direct democracy]] but, owing to constitutional amendments, these provisions were never permitted to come into effect. The provisions stated that the referendum and initiative would operate on the same franchise as the D\u00e1il; this was [[universal suffrage]] beginning at the age of 21. The constitution provided for three forms of direct democracy:\n\n* '''Constitutional referendum''': After an initial period all [[constitutional amendment]]s would be subject to a mandatory, binding [[referendum]]. An amendment would not be deemed to have been passed unless at least a majority of registered voters participated in the referendum and the votes in favour were equal to either: (1) a majority ''of all eligible voters'', or (2) a two-thirds majority of ''votes cast''. This provision was stricter than the modern Constitution of Ireland, which merely requires a majority of votes cast.\n* '''Veto of legislation''': Once a bill had been approved by both houses of the Oireachtas (or just by the D\u00e1il, if it had over-ridden the Senate) its enactment into law could be suspended if, within seven days, either a majority of the Senate or 40% of all members of the D\u00e1il so requested. There would then be a further period of ninety days within which either 5% of all registered voters, or a 60% majority in the Senate, could demand a referendum on the bill. The referendum would be decided by a majority of votes cast. If rejected the bill would not become law. These provisions did not apply to [[money bill]]s or bills declared by both houses to be \"necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety\".\n* '''Initiative''': Ordinary citizens would have the right, through an [[initiative]] process, to draft both constitutional amendments and ordinary laws, and insist that they be submitted to a referendum. The constitution provided a general frame-work for how the initiative would work, empowering the Oireachtas to fill in the details with legislation. It required that a proposal could be initiated by a petition of 50,000 registered voters. Once initiated a proposal would be referred to the Oireachtas, but if the Oireachtas did not adopt the law it would be obliged to submit it to a binding referendum. The constitution gave the Oireachtas two years to adopt a law allowing voters to introduce initiatives. However, after this time voters had power to force the issue. This is because the initiative process itself could then by made the subject of an initiative. After two years the introduction of an initiative process would be put to a referendum if demanded by a petition of not less than 75,000 voters on the register (not more than fifteen thousand of whom could be voters in any one constituency).\n\nThe [[Achilles' heel]] of the direct democracy provisions was contained in Article 50 which provided that, for eight years after the constitution came into force, the Oireachtas could amend the constitution without a referendum. As interpreted by the courts, this even included the power to amend the article itself and extend this period.\n\nThe Oireachtas did not adopt legislation providing for the initiative within the two years stipulated by the constitution and, eventually, a petition of 96,000 signature was gathered by the opposition to trigger a referendum forcing the Oireachtas to introduce an initiative process. The Oireachtas responded by removing all provisions for direct democracy from the constitution, save for the requirement that, once the eight-year transitional period had passed, it would be necessary to hold referendums on all constitutional amendments. Then in 1929 the Oireachtas extended this period to sixteen years. This meant that, by the time the constitution was replaced in 1937, the provisions for the constitutional referendum had still not come into force.\n\n==Amendments==\n\n===Method of amendment===\n\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\n\n[[File:Seal of the Irish Free State.png|thumb|200px|The [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State]], used in the state from 1924.]]\n\nThe procedure for adopting constitutional amendments was laid out in Article 50. This foresaw that amendments would first be approved by both houses of the Oireachtas, then submitted to a referendum, and finally receive the [[royal assent]] from the Governor-General. However, as already noted, the requirement for a referendum was postponed by the Oireachtas so that during the entire period of the Irish Free State the Constitution could be amended by means of an ordinary law. As noted above it was originally provided that any amendments that violated the Anglo-Irish Treaty would be inadmissible, but this sole restriction was removed in 1933.\n\nThe Oireachtas readily used its powers of amendment so that, during the 15 years of the Constitution's operation, 25 formal constitutional amendments were made. This can be contrasted with the fact that, during its first 60 years, the current Constitution of Ireland was amended only 16 times. In addition to the adoption of constitutional amendments, the courts ruled that the Oireachtas could also implicitly amend the constitution. When the Oireachtas adopted the [[Public Safety Act 1927]], which affected civil rights, it included a section requiring that should the act be found to be unconstitutional it would be treated as a constitutional amendment. Section 3 of the act provided that:\n\n{{quote|Every provision of this Act which is in contravention of any provision of the Constitution shall to the extent of such contravention operate and have effect as an amendment [...] of the Constitution.}}\n\nIn the ''Attorney General v. McBride'' (1928) it was ruled that this kind of section was unnecessary because even if a law did not contain such a provision it could be interpreted as a tacit amendment of the constitution anyway, owing to the doctrine of [[implied repeal]]. This meant that, in addition to formal amendments, almost any act of the Oireachtas could be considered an amendment of the constitution. The long process of ''ad hoc'' amendment that occurred until 1937 meant that, by the time it was replaced the constitution had become, according to President (of the Executive Council) [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], a \"tattered and torn affair\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1937051100030#N126 |title=Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann (Dr\u00e9acht)\u2014Dara C\u00e9im. |work=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debates |date=11 May 1937 |nopp=y|page=Vol.67 No.1 p.30 col.73 |accessdate=30 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWhile Article 50 provided for the amendment of the constitution proper, there was no explicit provision in any law for the amendment of the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922''. Some jurists therefore maintained that the Oireachtas did not have power to amend the Act; rather, if it were possible to alter the law at all, it might be necessary to ask the British Parliament to do so, or to elect another constituent assembly. Chief Justice Kennedy was among those who took the view that the act could not be altered by the Oireachtas. Nonetheless changes were eventually made to the act, when the Oireachtas passed the ''[[Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933]]'', and when it was repealed in its entirety with the adoption of the 1937 constitution.\n\nWhen the new constitution was drafted lessons had been learned from the Free State constitution. It too granted the Oireachtas a temporary power to make constitutional amendments by ordinary law, but, unlike the Free State constitution, it expressly forbade the legislature from using this power to extend the transitional period. Article 46 of the new constitution required that constitutional amendments be approved by referendum while Article 51 of the Transitory Provisions suspended this requirement for an initial three years (beginning when the first president assumed office). However Article 46 forbade the legislature from amending either itself or Article 51. In the event the Oireachtas used its transitional power only twice, when it adopted the [[First Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|First Amendment]] and the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. The new constitution then settled down and was not amended again for thirty years. Another difference from the Free State constitution is that the modern constitution requires constitutional amendments to be expressly identified as such. Every amendment must have the long title \"An Act to amend the Constitution\".\n\n===Subjects of amendments===\n\nSome amendments made minor changes, such as removing the requirement that elections occur on a public holiday, but others were more radical. These included extending the term of the D\u00e1il in 1927, the abolition of the initiative and of direct elections to the Senate in 1928, extending the period during which the Oireachtas could amend the constitution in 1928, and the introduction of provisions for trial by military tribunals in 1931. From 1933 onwards a series of further amendments were made that gradually dismantled the Treaty settlement by, for example, abolishing the Oath of Allegiance and the office of Governor General. Because a majority of its members disagreed with this process, the Senate was abolished in 1936.\n\n===List of amendments===\n\nIn each case but one, the acts amending the Constitution were titled in the form [[Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925]]. The exception is [[Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933]], which does not have a number. The acts are listed below in order of their enactment, but the numbering of constitutional amendments coincides with the order in which they were introduced as [[bill (law)|bill]]s, so that the sequence does not follow in strict order. There were no Amendments numbered 18, 19 or 25. In addition, \"ordinary\" Acts of the Oireachtas could modify the constitution. The amendments effected by these acts all lapsed in 1937 with the repeal of the Constitution of the Irish Free State and adoption of the Constitution of Ireland, and the acts themselves were formally repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/20/schedule/enacted/en/html|title=Statute Law Revision Act 2016, Schedule|website=Irish Statute Book|date=26 December 2016|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!No.\n!Date\n!Change\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925|No. 1]] || 11 July 1925 || Provided that the first Senators would vacate office in December 1925, made changes relating to the terms of office of senators, and the date on which senatorial elections were to be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1925/act/30/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925|website=Irish Statute Book|date=11 July 1925|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 3 || 4 March 1927 || Removed the requirement that the day of any general election would be declared a public holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/4/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 3) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=4 March 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 4) Act 1927|No. 4]] || 4 March 1927 || Extended the maximum term of the D\u00e1il from four to six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/5/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 4) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=4 March 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act 1927|No. 2]] || 19 March 1927 || Introduced a system of automatic re-election of the [[Ceann Comhairle]] (Chairman of the D\u00e1il) in a general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/6/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=19 March 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 5 ||5 May 1927 || Increased the maximum membership of the Executive Council from seven to twelve members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/13/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=5 May 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Act 1928|No. 10]] || 12 July 1928 || Removed referendums on bills and petitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1928/act/8/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Act 1928|website=Irish Statute Book|date=12 July 1928|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 6 || 23 July 1928 || Replaced the direct election of the Seanad with a system of indirect election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1928/act/13/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Act 1928|website=Irish Statute Book|date=23 July 1928|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 13 || 23 July 1928 || Extended the power of delay of the Seanad over legislation from nine months to twenty months.

However, following a [[1932 Irish general election|change of government in 1932]] and the adoption of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] a series of amendments progressively removed many of the provisions that had been required by the Treaty.\n\nThe Constitution established a [[parliamentary system]] of government under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], and contained guarantees of certain [[fundamental rights]]. It was intended that the constitution would be a rigid document that, after an initial period, could be amended only by [[referendum]]. However, amendments were made to the Constitution's amendment procedure, so that all amendments could be and were in fact made by a simple [[Act of Parliament|Act of the Oireachtas]] (parliament).\n\n==Background and enactment==\n\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2019}}<!--2 subsections have no footnotes-->\n\n===Debate on whether a written constitution was required===\n\nWhether or not the Irish Free State would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Bill was introduced to the Provisional Parliament by President Cosgrave.<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\"/> The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] leader, Thomas Johnson, remarked:\n\n{{quote|[T]here is no compulsion\u2014so far as I can read in the Treaty\u2014for a Constitution \u2014a written Constitution\u2014to be established at all.... It would be wiser, I suggest, to leave the enactment of a Constitution until there is something like quietude in the country....

The Labour leader also objected to the manner in which the Provisional Parliament was being described as a \"constituent assembly\" when in fact it was not acting of its \"free volition\" and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution.<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\">{{cite web|url = https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-09-18/30/ | publisher = Oireachtas.ie | work = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann Debate | date= 18 September 1922| title = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate - Monday, 18 Sep 1922 - Bill to Enact Constitution}}</ref> He compared it to re-establishing [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]].<ref name=\"debate18Sep22\"/>\n\nNonetheless, there were counter arguments in favour of adopting a written constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1922-09-21/9/ | publisher = Oireachtas.ie | work = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann Debate | date= 21 September 1922| title = D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate - Thursday, 21 Sep 1922 - Constitution Debates Resumed}}</ref> Irish nationalists who fought the [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]] believed themselves to be fighting on behalf of a newly formed state called the [[Irish Republic]]. The Irish Republic had its own president, an elected assembly called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], and a judicial system in the form of the [[D\u00e1il Courts]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1920-06-29/25/ | publisher = Oireachtas.ie | work = D\u00e1il Record - Volume 1  | date= 29 June 1920 | title = Decrees - Courts Of Justice And Equity And Criminal Jurisdiction }}</ref> This republic was recognised by the revolutionary government in Russia. In the negotiations leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty the British government insisted that the new Irish state must remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and not be a republic. Furthermore, while the Irish Republic had a constitution, of sorts, in the form of the [[D\u00e1il Constitution]], this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional. It was therefore the prevalent view that when, in 1921, the British government agreed to the creation of a largely independent Irish state, that a new constitution was needed. The Anglo-Irish Treaty made a number of requirements of the new constitution. Among these were that:<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.difp.ie/docs/1921/Anglo-Irish-Treaty/214.htm | publisher = Royal Irish Academy | work = Documents on Irish Foreign Policy | date = 6 November 1921 | title = Document No. 214 DE 2/304/1 - Final text of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland as signed }}</ref>\n\n* the new state would be called the Irish Free State and would be a [[British Dominions|dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]];\n* the King would be the [[head of state]] and would be represented by a Governor General;\n* members of the Oireachtas (parliament) would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State and declare their fidelity to the King.  This [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Free State Oath of Allegiance]] was controversial; and\n* [[Northern Ireland]] would be included in the Irish Free State unless its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] decided to ''[[Partition of Ireland|opt out]]'' (which it did).\n\n===Legislative competence===\n\nOn 31 March 1922, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament called the [[Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922]] was passed. It gave the force of law to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. It also provided by for the election of a body to be called the \"House of the Parliament\", sometimes called the \"Provisional Parliament\", to which the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]] established under that act would be responsible. The act gave no power to the Provisional Parliament to enact a constitution for the Irish Free State.<ref name=\"Moore v Attorney General\"/> In due course, \"the House of the Parliament,\" provided for by that act, was elected and met on 9 September 1922, and calling itself D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the Constitution of the Irish Free State.\n\n===Constitution Committee===\n\nShortly after the British evacuated their troops from [[Dublin Castle]] in January 1922, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent Irish Free State which would come into being in December 1922.<ref>Address to the Constitutional Convention, Dublin Castle, 1 December 2012 by Gerard Hogan, judge of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court of Ireland]]</ref>  Mr Collins chaired the first meeting of that committee and at that point (he died before the constitution was finalised) was its chairman. [[Darrell Figgis]], the vice-chairman became acting Chair. The committee produced three draft texts, designated A, B and C. A was signed by Figgis, [[James McNeill]] and [[John O'Byrne]]. B was signed by [[James G. Douglas]], C.J. France and [[Hugh Kennedy]] and it differed substantially from A only in proposals regarding the Executive.<ref>Douglas p81</ref> This difference was intended by Douglas to permit the anti-treaty faction a say in the final proposed constitution before its submission to the British Government. As such it was, according to Douglas, an attempt to ameliorate the pro- and anti-treaty split. Draft C was the most novel of the three. It was signed by [[Alfred O'Rahilly]] and [[James Murnaghan]], and provided for the possibility of representation for the people of the northern counties in the D\u00e1il in the event of that area opting out of the proposed free state.<ref>Douglas p85</ref><br /> The Irish text was then drafted as a translation of the English text. The [[Irish language]] version was drafted by a committee which included the Minister for Education, [[Eoin MacNeill]]; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy speaker), [[P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille]]; the Clerk of the D\u00e1il, Colm \u00d3 Murchadha; [[Piaras B\u00e9asla\u00ed]]; [[Liam \u00d3 Rinn]] and Professors [[Osborn Bergin]] and [[T. F. O'Rahilly]].\n\n===Method of adoption===\n\nAs a practical matter, the process of drafting the constitution began with the establishment by Michael Collins of the committee to draft a new constitution. This started shortly after the Provisional Government was established in January 1922. In subsequent months members of the Provisional Government negotiated the draft constitution with the British authorities. After that process was completed, a bill entitled the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Bill'' was introduced into D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (the [[Third D\u00e1il]]) in September 1922, the D\u00e1il sitting as a \"constituent assembly\". It was enacted by the Third D\u00e1il on 25 October 1922.\n\nArticle 83 of the constitution provided that \"The passing and adoption of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament shall be announced as soon as may be, and not later than the sixth day of December, Nineteen hundred and twenty-two, by Proclamation of His Majesty, and this Constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such Proclamation.\"\n\nThe British Parliament then passed the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]], which came into force on 5 December 1922. This act recited that the House of Parliament constituted pursuant to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, sitting as a constituent assembly for the settlement of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, had passed the measure set forth in the schedule to the act, (namely the constitution adopted by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann), which it then referred to as \"the Constituent Act\". It then provided that the Constituent Act should be the Constitution of the Irish Free State and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by His Majesty in accordance with Article 83 of the constitution.\n\nThe Royal Proclamation bringing the constitution into force was made on 6 December 1922. Referring to the constitution as a \"Measure\" whereby the constitution appearing as the First Schedule to the Constituent Act was declared to be the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Royal Proclamation went on to \"announce and proclaim that the Constitution of the Irish Free State as the same was passed and adopted by the said Constituent Assembly has been passed and adopted by Parliament\". The 6 December 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] for the continued authority of the Provisional Government set up by the treaty pending \"the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State\". On this date also the members of the D\u00e1il took the Oath of Allegiance, and nominated the members of the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] (the cabinet).\n\n===Incorporation of the treaty===\n\nThe ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' contained two schedules. One schedule contained the new constitution, and the other the text of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. As enacted in 1922, Section 2 of the act provided for the supremacy of the treaty's provisions, voiding any part of the Constitution or other Free State law that was \"[[:wikt:repugnant|repugnant]]\" to it. Similarly, both Section 2 of the act and Article 50 of the constitution provided that no constitutional amendment would stand so far as it violated the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe enactment by the British Parliament of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 changed the legal framework as understood by the British.  The statute was designed to increase the legislative autonomy of all the dominions.  In contrast with certain of the other dominions, the statute did not specifically place any reservation on this power as exerciseable by the Free State, and thus granted it the power to alter Irish law in any way it chose.  The new government under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] soon used this new freedom to enact the ''Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933''. Besides abolishing the Oath of Allegiance, a requirement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the act also expressly repealed the provisions both of the constitution proper and of the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' that required compliance with the treaty.  Subsequent legislation soon began to dismantle other constitutional provisions that had been required or limited by the treaty's terms.\n\n===Constitution's authority===\n\nUnder British constitutional legal theory, the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' held the force of law because of the enactment of the United Kingdom's ''Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922''.  However, under Irish law the constitution \"derived its authority not from the Act of the imperial parliament passed on the 5th December, 1922, or from the proclamation made on the 6th December, 1922, but from the Act of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann sitting as a constituent assembly passed on the 25th October, 1922\".<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/(WebFiles)/4BDC71672260E0218025765E0036A4F4/$FILE/State%20(Ryan)%20v%20Lennon_1934.rtf ''The State (Ryan and Others) v.

The ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' consisted of only a short preamble and three short sections, but was a far longer document because, as noted above, it included as schedules the full text of both the constitution proper and the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\n\nThe articles of the Constitution proper were not grouped together under headings, save for the final ten articles (which came under the title of \"Transitory Provisions\"). However, divided by subject matter the articles of the Constitution broke down roughly as follows:\n{|\n|\n* Introductory provisions (Arts. 1\u20134)\n* Fundamental rights (Arts. 5\u201310)\n* Legislature (Arts. 13\u201346)\n** D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Arts. 26\u201329)\n** The Senate (Arts. 30\u201334)\n* Initiative and referendum (Arts. 47\u201348)\n|\n* Constitutional amendments (Art. 50)\n* Cabinet (Arts. 51\u201359)\n* Governor-General (Art. 60)\n* Regulation of state finances (Arts. 61\u201363)\n* Courts (Arts. 64\u201372)\n* Transitory Provisions (Arts. 73\u201383)\n|}\n\n===Preamble===\n\nThe constitution itself had no preamble. However the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922'' began with the following words:\n\n{{quote|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people and in the confidence that the National life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored, hereby proclaims the establishment of The Irish Free State (otherwise called Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) and in the exercise of undoubted right, decrees and enacts as follows:\u2014}}\n\n===Characteristics of the state===\n\n* '''Commonwealth membership:''' Article 1 stated that the state would be a \"co-equal member\" of the British Commonwealth.\n* '''Popular sovereignty:''' It was stated that the \"all powers of government... are derived from the people of Ireland\" (Article 2).\n* '''Citizenship:''' The constitution provided that those living in the state at the time of its coming into force who had been born in Ireland, had parents born in Ireland or had been resident in the state for seven years would become citizens. However anyone who was the citizen of another state could choose not to become an Irish citizen (Article 3).\n* '''National language''': It was provided that Irish was the \"National Language\" but English was \"equally recognised as an official language\" (Article 4). The constitution included the terms ''Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' (as one name for the Irish Free State), ''Oireachtas'' (for the legislature), and ''D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann'' and ''Seanad \u00c9ireann'' (for the houses of the legislature), all of which were intended for use even in English speech.\n\n===Individual rights===\n\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\n\nUnlike the then constitutions of Australia and Canada, the constitution included a [[bill of rights]], in Articles 6\u201310. Rights were also protected by a number of provisions contained in other articles.\n\n* '''Prohibition of titles of nobility''': It was provided that no title of honour, including [[knighthood]]s and [[peerage]]s, could be conferred on an Irish citizen without the consent of the Executive Council (Article 5). In practice this amounted to a complete ban.\n* '''Liberty and ''habeas corpus''''': Article 6 provided that no-one could be deprived of liberty except in accordance with the law, and that ''[[habeas corpus]]'' would be upheld. The military forces were granted an exemption from this article during time of war or rebellion.\n* '''Inviolability of the home''': The home could not be entered except in accordance with the law (Article 7).\n* '''Freedom of conscience and worship''': Protected by Article 9 subject to \"public order and morality\" (Article 8).\n* '''Prohibition of establishment''': The state could not \"endow\" any religion (Article 8).\n* '''Religious discrimination''': The state could not discriminate on religious grounds (Article 8).\n* '''Freedom of speech, assembly and association''': All guaranteed subject to \"public morality\". Laws regulating freedom of assembly and association could not be discriminatory (Article 9).\n* '''Right to education''': Free elementary education guaranteed to all citizens (Article 10).\n* '''Trial by jury''': Guaranteed by Article 72, which granted an exemption for minor offences and offences triable by [[court martial]].\n\nThe constitution empowered the courts to strike down laws they found to be unconstitutional. However judicial review of legislation was made largely meaningless by the ease with which the Oireachtas could alter the constitution. Furthermore, as the state had only recently seceded from the UK, Irish judges were trained in British jurisprudence. To this tradition, founded on deference to the legislature and [[parliamentary sovereignty]], constitutional review was an alien concept. This meant that despite the adoption of a new, more rigid constitution in 1937, constitutional review did not become a significant feature of Irish jurisprudence until the 1960s. During the entire period of the Free State, only two pieces of legislation were declared by the courts to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe Free State had significant problems with public order in early years. It was founded during the [[Irish Civil War]] which did not come to an end until May 1923, and thereafter there were continuing problems of public disorder and subversive activities by the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). This situation led to an erosion of civil rights in the new state. During the Civil War a law provided the death penalty for the crime of unlawful possession of a [[firearm]], and more than seventy people were executed for the offence. Strong security measures continued to be used after the war's conclusion; these included internment of former rebels and the punishment of [[flogging]] for arson and [[armed robbery]], introduced in 1924.\n\nIn 1931, acting in response to IRA violence, the Oireachtas adopted Amendment No. 17 of the constitution. This added a sweeping set of provisions called Article 2A to the constitution. Article 2A was very large, consisting of five parts and 34 sections. Among other provisions it granted powers of arrest, detention and trial of people before military tribunals not bound by normal rules of evidence, despite the fact that many crimes triable before the tribunals carried a mandatory death sentence. To protect itself from being undermined by the courts, Article 2A was drafted to state that it took precedence over all other provisions of the constitution (save Article 1).\n\nThe provisions for military tribunals were challenged in 1935 in the case of The State (Ryan) v. Lennon. In this case the majority of the Supreme Court reluctantly held that, because Amendment No. 17 had been duly adopted in accordance with the correct procedure, it was not open to the judges to strike it down. However Chief Justice Kennedy disagreed, arguing, in a dissenting opinion, that the Article 2A violated [[natural law]].\n\n===Organs of government===\n\nThe constitution provided for a parliamentary system of government. The legislature was called the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]], consisting of the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|monarch]] and two houses: the Chamber of Deputies, to be known generally as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], was established as the [[lower house]], and the Senate, to be known generally as [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad \u00c9ireann]], as the [[upper house]].<ref>Article 12, Constitution of the Irish Free State</ref> The Seanad had only limited powers of delay so the D\u00e1il was the dominant house.\n\nExecutive authority was vested in the King and exercised by the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]], who would appoint an [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] to \"aid and advise\" him. The Executive Council was headed by a prime minister, the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. In practice, however, the President was nominated by the D\u00e1il and formally appointed by the Governor-General. The President then nominated the remaining members of the Executive Council. The D\u00e1il was empowered to dismiss it by a [[vote of no confidence]]. With few exceptions, the Governor-General was required to act on the Executive Council's advice.\n\nThe constitution provided that the [[judiciary]] would consist of the [[Irish Free State Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], the High Court, and any lower courts established by law.\n\n===Initiative and referendum===\n\nAs originally adopted the constitution contained (in Articles 47, 48 and 50) innovative provisions for [[direct democracy]] but, owing to constitutional amendments, these provisions were never permitted to come into effect. The provisions stated that the referendum and initiative would operate on the same franchise as the D\u00e1il; this was [[universal suffrage]] beginning at the age of 21. The constitution provided for three forms of direct democracy:\n\n* '''Constitutional referendum''': After an initial period all [[constitutional amendment]]s would be subject to a mandatory, binding [[referendum]]. An amendment would not be deemed to have been passed unless at least a majority of registered voters participated in the referendum and the votes in favour were equal to either: (1) a majority ''of all eligible voters'', or (2) a two-thirds majority of ''votes cast''. This provision was stricter than the modern Constitution of Ireland, which merely requires a majority of votes cast.\n* '''Veto of legislation''': Once a bill had been approved by both houses of the Oireachtas (or just by the D\u00e1il, if it had over-ridden the Senate) its enactment into law could be suspended if, within seven days, either a majority of the Senate or 40% of all members of the D\u00e1il so requested. There would then be a further period of ninety days within which either 5% of all registered voters, or a 60% majority in the Senate, could demand a referendum on the bill. The referendum would be decided by a majority of votes cast. If rejected the bill would not become law. These provisions did not apply to [[money bill]]s or bills declared by both houses to be \"necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety\".\n* '''Initiative''': Ordinary citizens would have the right, through an [[initiative]] process, to draft both constitutional amendments and ordinary laws, and insist that they be submitted to a referendum. The constitution provided a general frame-work for how the initiative would work, empowering the Oireachtas to fill in the details with legislation. It required that a proposal could be initiated by a petition of 50,000 registered voters. Once initiated a proposal would be referred to the Oireachtas, but if the Oireachtas did not adopt the law it would be obliged to submit it to a binding referendum. The constitution gave the Oireachtas two years to adopt a law allowing voters to introduce initiatives. However, after this time voters had power to force the issue. This is because the initiative process itself could then by made the subject of an initiative. After two years the introduction of an initiative process would be put to a referendum if demanded by a petition of not less than 75,000 voters on the register (not more than fifteen thousand of whom could be voters in any one constituency).\n\nThe [[Achilles' heel]] of the direct democracy provisions was contained in Article 50 which provided that, for eight years after the constitution came into force, the Oireachtas could amend the constitution without a referendum. As interpreted by the courts, this even included the power to amend the article itself and extend this period.\n\nThe Oireachtas did not adopt legislation providing for the initiative within the two years stipulated by the constitution and, eventually, a petition of 96,000 signature was gathered by the opposition to trigger a referendum forcing the Oireachtas to introduce an initiative process. The Oireachtas responded by removing all provisions for direct democracy from the constitution, save for the requirement that, once the eight-year transitional period had passed, it would be necessary to hold referendums on all constitutional amendments. Then in 1929 the Oireachtas extended this period to sixteen years. This meant that, by the time the constitution was replaced in 1937, the provisions for the constitutional referendum had still not come into force.\n\n==Amendments==\n\n===Method of amendment===\n\n{{unref|section|date=October 2019}}\n\n[[File:Seal of the Irish Free State.png|thumb|200px|The [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State]], used in the state from 1924.]]\n\nThe procedure for adopting constitutional amendments was laid out in Article 50. This foresaw that amendments would first be approved by both houses of the Oireachtas, then submitted to a referendum, and finally receive the [[royal assent]] from the Governor-General. However, as already noted, the requirement for a referendum was postponed by the Oireachtas so that during the entire period of the Irish Free State the Constitution could be amended by means of an ordinary law. As noted above it was originally provided that any amendments that violated the Anglo-Irish Treaty would be inadmissible, but this sole restriction was removed in 1933.\n\nThe Oireachtas readily used its powers of amendment so that, during the 15 years of the Constitution's operation, 25 formal constitutional amendments were made. This can be contrasted with the fact that, during its first 60 years, the current Constitution of Ireland was amended only 16 times. In addition to the adoption of constitutional amendments, the courts ruled that the Oireachtas could also implicitly amend the constitution. When the Oireachtas adopted the [[Public Safety Act 1927]], which affected civil rights, it included a section requiring that should the act be found to be unconstitutional it would be treated as a constitutional amendment. Section 3 of the act provided that:\n\n{{quote|Every provision of this Act which is in contravention of any provision of the Constitution shall to the extent of such contravention operate and have effect as an amendment [...] of the Constitution.}}\n\nIn the ''Attorney General v. McBride'' (1928) it was ruled that this kind of section was unnecessary because even if a law did not contain such a provision it could be interpreted as a tacit amendment of the constitution anyway, owing to the doctrine of [[implied repeal]]. This meant that, in addition to formal amendments, almost any act of the Oireachtas could be considered an amendment of the constitution. The long process of ''ad hoc'' amendment that occurred until 1937 meant that, by the time it was replaced the constitution had become, according to President (of the Executive Council) [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], a \"tattered and torn affair\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1937051100030#N126 |title=Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann (Dr\u00e9acht)\u2014Dara C\u00e9im. |work=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debates |date=11 May 1937 |nopp=y|page=Vol.67 No.1 p.30 col.73 |accessdate=30 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWhile Article 50 provided for the amendment of the constitution proper, there was no explicit provision in any law for the amendment of the ''Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act 1922''. Some jurists therefore maintained that the Oireachtas did not have power to amend the Act; rather, if it were possible to alter the law at all, it might be necessary to ask the British Parliament to do so, or to elect another constituent assembly. Chief Justice Kennedy was among those who took the view that the act could not be altered by the Oireachtas. Nonetheless changes were eventually made to the act, when the Oireachtas passed the ''[[Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933]]'', and when it was repealed in its entirety with the adoption of the 1937 constitution.\n\nWhen the new constitution was drafted lessons had been learned from the Free State constitution. It too granted the Oireachtas a temporary power to make constitutional amendments by ordinary law, but, unlike the Free State constitution, it expressly forbade the legislature from using this power to extend the transitional period. Article 46 of the new constitution required that constitutional amendments be approved by referendum while Article 51 of the Transitory Provisions suspended this requirement for an initial three years (beginning when the first president assumed office). However Article 46 forbade the legislature from amending either itself or Article 51. In the event the Oireachtas used its transitional power only twice, when it adopted the [[First Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|First Amendment]] and the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. The new constitution then settled down and was not amended again for thirty years. Another difference from the Free State constitution is that the modern constitution requires constitutional amendments to be expressly identified as such. Every amendment must have the long title \"An Act to amend the Constitution\".\n\n===Subjects of amendments===\n\nSome amendments made minor changes, such as removing the requirement that elections occur on a public holiday, but others were more radical. These included extending the term of the D\u00e1il in 1927, the abolition of the initiative and of direct elections to the Senate in 1928, extending the period during which the Oireachtas could amend the constitution in 1928, and the introduction of provisions for trial by military tribunals in 1931. From 1933 onwards a series of further amendments were made that gradually dismantled the Treaty settlement by, for example, abolishing the Oath of Allegiance and the office of Governor General. Because a majority of its members disagreed with this process, the Senate was abolished in 1936.\n\n===List of amendments===\n\nIn each case but one, the acts amending the Constitution were titled in the form [[Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925]]. The exception is [[Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933]], which does not have a number. The acts are listed below in order of their enactment, but the numbering of constitutional amendments coincides with the order in which they were introduced as [[bill (law)|bill]]s, so that the sequence does not follow in strict order. There were no Amendments numbered 18, 19 or 25. In addition, \"ordinary\" Acts of the Oireachtas could modify the constitution. The amendments effected by these acts all lapsed in 1937 with the repeal of the Constitution of the Irish Free State and adoption of the Constitution of Ireland, and the acts themselves were formally repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/20/schedule/enacted/en/html|title=Statute Law Revision Act 2016, Schedule|website=Irish Statute Book|date=26 December 2016|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!No.\n!Date\n!Change\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925|No. 1]] || 11 July 1925 || Provided that the first Senators would vacate office in December 1925, made changes relating to the terms of office of senators, and the date on which senatorial elections were to be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1925/act/30/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925|website=Irish Statute Book|date=11 July 1925|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 3 || 4 March 1927 || Removed the requirement that the day of any general election would be declared a public holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/4/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 3) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=4 March 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 4) Act 1927|No. 4]] || 4 March 1927 || Extended the maximum term of the D\u00e1il from four to six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/5/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 4) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=4 March 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act 1927|No. 2]] || 19 March 1927 || Introduced a system of automatic re-election of the [[Ceann Comhairle]] (Chairman of the D\u00e1il) in a general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/6/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=19 March 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 5 ||5 May 1927 || Increased the maximum membership of the Executive Council from seven to twelve members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/13/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 5) Act 1927|website=Irish Statute Book|date=5 May 1927|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Act 1928|No. 10]] || 12 July 1928 || Removed referendums on bills and petitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1928/act/8/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Act 1928|website=Irish Statute Book|date=12 July 1928|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 6 || 23 July 1928 || Replaced the direct election of the Seanad with a system of indirect election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1928/act/13/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Act 1928|website=Irish Statute Book|date=23 July 1928|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n|No. 13 || 23 July 1928 || Extended the power of delay of the Seanad over legislation from nine months to twenty months.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with [[Amnesty International]] and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.<ref

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator.

The Cuirass ventilator encloses only the patient's torso, or chest and abdomen, but otherwise operates essentially the same as the original, full-sized iron lung. A modern version is the ''exovent.''   A lightweight variation on the cuirass ventilator is the ''jacket ventilator'' or ''poncho'' or ''raincoat''  ventilator, which uses a flexible, impermeable material (such as plastic or rubber) stretched over a metal or plastic frame over the patient's torso.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"modern_iron_lung_2020_04_06_newatlas\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_and_2020_04_11_oxy_gen\">[http://oxygen.milano.it/en/the-iron-lung-and-the-modern-ventilation/ \"The 'iron lung' and the modern 'ventilation',\"] Oxy.gen, \nretrieved April 11, 2020 (caution: source unclear; apparently an Italian oxygen-supplier)</ref><ref name=\"poncho_dima_italia_sri\">[https://www.dimaitalia.com/en/tag/poncho/ \"Poncho,\"] by medical device manufacturer [[Dima Italia Srl]] of [[Bologna, Italy]] (picture of jacket ventilator (\"poncho\"), and other information.), retrieved April 12, 2020</ref>\n\n==Method and use==\n===normal breathing===\n\nHumans, like most mammals, breathe by ''negative pressure'' breathing:<ref name=stemnet>{{cite web|title=Gas Exchange in Humans|url=http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|accessdate=2011-07-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423113840/http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|archivedate=2009-04-23}}</ref> the rib cage expands and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] contracts, expanding the [[chest cavity]]. This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head (which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth). A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) reduces the momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").  \n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air out of the lungs, through the patient's airway, to their mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head (which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth). A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) reduces the momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.  \n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung. \n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").  \n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air out of the lungs, through the patient's airway, to their mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

There were also concerns over soldiers seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had joined the army in the hope of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} The Legion came as a solution for those who would not conform to the governing agenda: a way for the French State to contend the most restless soldiers and keep them at sight.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the soldiers during the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}. The Algerian war was very unpopular. [[Louis Philipe I]] was a pacifist and did not want to risk to loose the favours of the public opinion, nor did he want to upset his military commandment by endangering too many French lives. Hence the idea of using foreign troops, that would be recruited for the combats and that would be organised in a dedicated corps: the French Foreign Legion. \n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.
