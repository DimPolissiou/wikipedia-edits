The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further. It ordered \"Operation Deep Dive,\"<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\" /> a full safety review of Metro-North, in which every aspect of its corporate culture would be evaluated by a panel of rail safety experts.

Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.
