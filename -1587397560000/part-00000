{"title_page": "Reentrancy (computing)", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2012}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020|cs1-dates=y}}\nIn [[computing]], a [[computer program]] or [[subroutine]] is called '''reentrant''' if multiple invocations can safely run concurrently. The concept applies even on a single processor system, where a reentrant procedure can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again (\"re-entered\") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. The previous invocations may resume correct execution before the reentered invocation completes, unlike [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]], where the previous invocations may only resume correct execution once the reentered invocation completes. \n\nThis definition originates from multiprogramming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR) or \"handler\" subroutine. Any subroutine used by the handler that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.\n\nThis definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).\n\nOther terms used for reentrant programs include \"pure procedure\"<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\"/> or \"sharable code\".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514\u20131515}} Reentrant subroutines are sometimes marked in reference material as being \"signal safe\".<ref>{{cite web |title=pthread_cond_init()--Initialize Condition Variable |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/apis/users_75.htm |website=IBM Knowledge Center |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nReentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.\n\nData has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).\n\nLocal data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name). In [[object-oriented programming]], global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of [[instance variable]]s, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).\n\nReentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, [[thread-safety]]. A function can be [[thread-safe]] and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a [[mutex]] (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only ''one'' thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.\n\n==Rules for reentrancy==\n;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data.\n:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that only [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] [[read-modify-write]] instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes.{{r|Preshing (2013)}} The C standard and SUSv3 provide <code>sig_atomic_t</code> for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing.{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA428 428]}} More complex atomic operations are available in [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]], which provides <code>stdatomic.h</code>.\n;Reentrant code may not [[self-modifying code|modify itself]].\n:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., [[blitting]] graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code might not be the same next time.\n:It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).\n;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant [[computer program]]s or [[Subroutine|routines]].\n:Multiple levels of user, object, or process [[Priority queue|priority]] or [[multiprocessing]] usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.\n\nReentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the [[atomicity (programming)|atomicity]] of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function {{code|f}} in an expression like <code>(global:=1) + (f())</code>, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in [[C (programming language)|C]], because the expression has no [[sequence point]].) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for [[signal (computing)|signals]], such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for [[interrupt]]s, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.\n\n==Examples==\nTo illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a [[C (programming language)|C]] utility function, {{code|swap()}}, that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.\n\n===Simple example ===\nIn the following code, neither <code>f</code> nor <code>g</code> functions are reentrant.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint v = 1;\n\nint f()\n{\n    v += 2;\n    return v;\n}\n\nint g()\n{\n    return f() + 2;\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the above, {{code|f()}} depends on a non-constant global variable {{code|v}}; thus, if {{code|f()}} is interrupted during execution by an ISR which modifies {{code|v}}, then reentry into {{code|f()}} will return the wrong value of {{code|v}}. The value of {{code|v}} and, therefore, the return value of {{code|f}}, cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on whether an interrupt modified {{code|v}} during {{code|f}}'s execution. Hence, {{code|f}} is not reentrant. Neither is {{code|g}}, because it calls {{code|f}}, which is not reentrant.\n\nThese slightly altered versions ''are'' reentrant:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint f(int i)\n{\n    return i + 2;\n}\n\nint g(int i)\n{\n    return f(i) + 2;\n}\n</source>\n\n===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===\nThis is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. Since the <code>tmp</code> variable is globally shared, without serialization, among any concurrent instances of the function, one instance may interfere with the data relied upon by another. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine <code>isr()</code>:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n    *y = tmp;    \n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Thread-safe but not reentrant===\nThe function {{code|swap()}} in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making {{code|tmp}} [[Thread-local storage|thread-local]]. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if {{code|isr()}} is called in the same context as a thread already executing {{code|swap()}}:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n_Thread_local int tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n    *y = tmp;    \n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Reentrant but not thread-safe===\nThe following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since there are no locks employed, it can be interrupted at any time:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint tmp;\n\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    /* Save global variable. */\n    int s;\n    s = tmp;\n\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = tmp;     /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n\n    /* Restore global variable. */\n    tmp = s;\n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Reentrant and thread-safe===\nAn implementation of {{code|swap()}} that allocates {{code|tmp}} on the [[call stack|stack]] instead of globally and that is called only with unshared variables as parameters{{efn|If isr() called swap() with one or two global variables as parameters then swap() would not be reentrant}} is both thread-safe and reentrant. Thread-safe because the stack is local to a thread and a function acting just on local data will always produce the expected result. There is no access to shared data therefore no data race.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nvoid swap(int* x, int* y)\n{\n    int tmp;\n    tmp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */\n}\n\nvoid isr()\n{\n    int x = 1, y = 2;\n    swap(&x, &y);\n}\n</source>\n\n==Reentrant interrupt handler==\nA reentrant interrupt handler is an [[interrupt handler]] that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce [[interrupt latency]].{{sfn|Sloss|Symes|Wright|Rayfield|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vdk4ZGRqMskC&pg=PA342 342]}} In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.{{r|Regehr (2006)}}\n\n==Further examples==\n\nIn the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint function()\n{\n    mutex_lock();\n\n    // ...\n    // function body\n    // ...\n\n    mutex_unlock();\n}\n</source>\n\nIn the above, {{code|function()}} can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Referential transparency]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Preshing (2013)\">\n  {{cite web\n  |last = Preshing\n  |first = Jeff\n  |title = Atomic vs. Non-Atomic Operations\n  |date = June 18, 2013\n  |website = Preshing on Programming\n  |url = http://preshing.com/20130618/atomic-vs-non-atomic-operations/\n  |access-date = April 24, 2018\n  |archive-url = https://archive.is/Yv6wS\n  |archive-date = December 3, 2014\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Regehr (2006)\">\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  |last = Regehr\n  |first = John\n  |author-link = John Regehr\n  |title = Safe and Structured Use of Interrupts in Real-time and Embedded Software\n  |encyclopedia = Handbook of Real-Time and Embedded Systems\n  |publisher = [[CRC Press]]\n  |date = 2006\n  |url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |format = PDF\n  |via = the author's website at the University of Utah School of Computing\n  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824025205/http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |archive-date = August 24, 2007\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\">{{cite book |author-first=David William |author-last=Barron |author-link=David W.

The concept applies even on a single processor system, where a reentrant procedure can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again (\"re-entered\") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. The previous invocations may resume correct execution before the reentered invocation completes, unlike [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]], where the previous invocations may only resume correct execution once the reentered invocation completes. \n\nThis definition originates from multiprogramming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR) or \"handler\" subroutine. Any subroutine used by the handler that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.\n\nThis definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).\n\nOther terms used for reentrant programs include \"pure procedure\"<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\"/> or \"sharable code\".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514\u20131515}} Reentrant subroutines are sometimes marked in reference material as being \"signal safe\".<ref>{{cite web |title=pthread_cond_init()--Initialize Condition Variable |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/apis/users_75.htm |website=IBM Knowledge Center |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nReentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.\n\nData has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).\n\nLocal data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name).

As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Referential transparency]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Preshing (2013)\">\n  {{cite web\n  |last = Preshing\n  |first = Jeff\n  |title = Atomic vs. Non-Atomic Operations\n  |date = June 18, 2013\n  |website = Preshing on Programming\n  |url = http://preshing.com/20130618/atomic-vs-non-atomic-operations/\n  |access-date = April 24, 2018\n  |archive-url = https://archive.is/Yv6wS\n  |archive-date = December 3, 2014\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Regehr (2006)\">\n{{cite encyclopedia\n  |last = Regehr\n  |first = John\n  |author-link = John Regehr\n  |title = Safe and Structured Use of Interrupts in Real-time and Embedded Software\n  |encyclopedia = Handbook of Real-Time and Embedded Systems\n  |publisher = [[CRC Press]]\n  |date = 2006\n  |url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |format = PDF\n  |via = the author's website at the University of Utah School of Computing\n  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824025205/http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/interrupt_chapter.pdf\n  |archive-date = August 24, 2007\n  |url-status = live\n  }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Barron_1968_Recursive\">{{cite book |author-first=David William |author-last=Barron |author-link=David W.

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\".

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* Nick Kobe - songwriter\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|5|year=2020|week=16|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|4|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|3|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/16|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 16|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)
