Live Free. Love Strong.''<ref name=\"365 Review\" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Timothy Monger used \"powerful\" and \"ambitious\" as descriptors of the album.<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> Reviewing for ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', Jen Rose Yokel said of ''Burn the Ships'': \"with its epic soundscapes and energetic, hopeful songwriting, it's a pop album you won't want to miss.\"<ref name=\"CCM Review\" /> The Christian Beat contributor Emily Caroline wrote that \"''Burn the Ships'' is definitely a release to look forward to. The Smallbone brothers have a lot to share with this album, using their smooth, warm, relatable vocals and relatable songwriting to touch many.\"<ref name=\"TCB Review\" /> Bestowing a perfect ten square rating for [[Cross Rhythms]], Tony Cummings concludes simply: \"An absolute gem of an album.\"<ref name=\"CR Review\" />\nIn a somewhat negative review from Jesus Freak Hideout, Michael Weaver rated the collection two stars, says \"''Burn the Ships'' isn't necessarily \"safe,\" but it isn't as aspiring as their earlier work. However, the album has some very bright moments and some more poignant ones as well.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review\" /> Wayne Myatt gave a more favourable second opinion in a Jesus Freak Hideout review, acknowledging \"They [For King & Country] have toned things down a bit on this release,\" as the band enters a new chapter in life but recommended to the duo's fans and \"perhaps those who favor the lighter side of pop and rock music.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review 1\" /> The album came under scrutiny from an additional two cents piece by Jesus Freak Hideout's Alex Caldwell, describing the collection as \"the tale of two albums,\" calling the first six tracks \"being creative, energetic and compelling\" yet the remainder are \"[[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] that shouldn't have made the record.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review 2\" /> Christopher Smith was more optimistic in his Jesus Freak Hideout additional two cents piece, saying that the duo have crafted \"their most cohesive album yet,\" deeming it \"a highlight pop release of 2018.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review 3\" /> In a NewReleaseToday review, Kevin Davis believes \"The album once again demonstrates multi-talented musicianship with creative, insightful lyrics and ear-grabbing melodies.\"<ref name=\"NRT Review\" /> Brandon Callies, in a positive On Tour Monthly review, optimistically expressed that the collection will impress the Christian pop fanbase, whilst asserting that the songs \"really push the boundaries of what contemporary Christian music generally has to offer. There is certainly more mainstream appeal.\"<ref name=\"OTM Review\" /> Robert Berman lauded the album in his review at ''Worship Musician Magazine'', declaring that ''Burn the Ships'' \"deserves a listen from all fans of hopeful, faithful pop.\"<ref name=\"WMM Review\" /> Abby Baracksai specified in a perfect five-out-of-five rating track-by-track review for Today's Christian Entertainment, that the album is \"absolutely fantastic. The music is wonderful and the lyrics are impactful.\"<ref name=\"TCE Review\" /> Today's Christian Entertainment, along with NewReleaseToday and ''CCM Magazine'' declared that the album is one of the best/top Christian records of 2018.<ref name=\"TCE Review\" /><ref name=\"NRT Review\" /><ref name=\"CCM Review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Live Free. Love Strong.''<ref name=\"365 Review\" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Timothy Monger used \"powerful\" and \"ambitious\" as descriptors of the album.<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> Reviewing for ''[[CCM Magazine]]'', Jen Rose Yokel said of ''Burn the Ships'': \"with its epic soundscapes and energetic, hopeful songwriting, it's a pop album you won't want to miss.\"<ref name=\"CCM Review\" /> The Christian Beat contributor Emily Caroline wrote that \"''Burn the Ships'' is definitely a release to look forward to. The Smallbone brothers have a lot to share with this album, using their smooth, warm, relatable vocals and relatable songwriting to touch many.\"<ref name=\"TCB Review\" /> Bestowing a perfect ten square rating for [[Cross Rhythms]], Tony Cummings concludes simply: \"An absolute gem of an album.\"<ref name=\"CR Review\" />\nIn a somewhat negative review from Jesus Freak Hideout, Michael Weaver rated the collection two stars, says \"''Burn the Ships'' isn't necessarily \"safe,\" but it isn't as aspiring as their earlier work. However, the album has some very bright moments and some more poignant ones as well.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review\" /> Wayne Myatt gave a more favourable second opinion in a Jesus Freak Hideout review, acknowledging \"They [For King & Country] have toned things down a bit on this release,\" as the band enters a new chapter in life but recommended to the duo's fans and \"perhaps those who favor the lighter side of pop and rock music.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review 1\" /> The album came under scrutiny from an additional two cents piece by Jesus Freak Hideout's Alex Caldwell, describing the collection as \"the tale of two albums,\" calling the first six tracks \"being creative, energetic and compelling\" yet the remainder are \"[[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] that shouldn't have made the record.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review 2\" /> Christopher Smith was more optimistic in his Jesus Freak Hideout additional two cents piece, saying that the duo have crafted \"their most cohesive album yet,\" deeming it \"a highlight pop release of 2018.\"<ref name=\"JFH Review 3\" /> In a NewReleaseToday review, Kevin Davis believes \"The album once again demonstrates multi-talented musicianship with creative, insightful lyrics and ear-grabbing melodies.\"<ref name=\"NRT Review\" /> Brandon Callies, in a positive On Tour Monthly review, optimistically expressed that the collection will impress the Christian pop fanbase, whilst asserting that the songs \"really push the boundaries of what contemporary Christian music generally has to offer. There is certainly more mainstream appeal.\"<ref name=\"OTM Review\" /> Robert Berman lauded the album in his review at ''Worship Musician Magazine'', declaring that ''Burn the Ships'' \"deserves a listen from all fans of hopeful, faithful pop.\"<ref name=\"WMM Review\" /> Abby Baracksai specified in a perfect five-out-of-five rating track-by-track review for Today's Christian Entertainment, that the album is \"absolutely fantastic. The music is wonderful and the lyrics are impactful.\"<ref name=\"TCE Review\" /> Today's Christian Entertainment, along with NewReleaseToday and ''CCM Magazine'' declared that the album is one of the best/top Christian records of 2018.<ref name=\"TCE Review\" /><ref name=\"NRT Review\" /><ref name=\"CCM Review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novel if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths in the categories of [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story|short story]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|novelette]], and [[Nebula Award for Best Novella|novella]]. To be eligible for [[Nebula Award]] consideration a novel must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/> The Nebula Award for Best Novel has been awarded annually since 1966. Novels which were expanded forms of previously published short stories are eligible, as are novellas published by themselves if the author requests them to be considered as a novel.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/> The award has been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name=\"Guardianquote\"/><ref name=\"TechRepquote\"/> \n\nNebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/> Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.<ref name=\"Locusrules\"/>\n\nDuring the 55 nomination years, 193 authors have had works nominated; 41 of these have won, including co-authors and ties. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] has received the most Nebula Awards for Best Novel with four wins out of six nominations. [[Joe Haldeman]] has received three awards out of four nominations, while nine other authors have won twice. [[Jack McDevitt]] has the most nominations at twelve, with one win, while [[Poul Anderson]] and [[Philip K. Dick]] have the most nominations without winning an award at five.\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\n\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners and joint winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"28%\" scope=\"col\"|Author\n! width=\"35%\" scope=\"col\"|Novel\n! width=\"26%\" scope=\"col\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"13\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1965 in literature|1966]]\n| {{sortname|Frank|Herbert}}* || ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' || [[Chilton Company]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Clifford D.|Simak}} || ''[[All Flesh is Grass (novel)|All Flesh is Grass]]'' || [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Theodore L.|Thomas}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{sort|Clone|''The Clone''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Berkley Books]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Kate|Wilhelm}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Philip K.|Dick}} || ''[[Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb]]'' || [[Ace Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|James|White|James White (author)}} || {{sort|Escape Orbit|''[[The Escape Orbit]]''}} || [[Ace Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Thomas M.|Disch}} || {{sort|Genocides|''[[The Genocides]]''}} || [[Berkley Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|William S.|Burroughs}} || ''[[Nova Express]]'' || [[Grove Press]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Keith|Laumer}} || {{sort|Plague of Demons|''A Plague of Demons''}} || [[Berkley Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Avram|Davidson}} || ''Rogue Dragon'' || [[Ace Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|G.

nebulas.sfwa.org/]\n}}\nThe '''Nebula Award for Best Novel''' is given each year by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy [[novel]]s. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novel if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths in the categories of [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story|short story]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|novelette]], and [[Nebula Award for Best Novella|novella]]. To be eligible for [[Nebula Award]] consideration a novel must be published in English in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are released on either a website or in an electronic edition.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/> The Nebula Award for Best Novel has been awarded annually since 1966. Novels which were expanded forms of previously published short stories are eligible, as are novellas published by themselves if the author requests them to be considered as a novel.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/> The award has been described as one of \"the most important of the American science fiction awards\" and \"the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent\" of the [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name=\"Guardianquote\"/><ref name=\"TechRepquote\"/> \n\nNebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.<ref name=\"NEBrules\"/> Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.<ref name=\"Locusrules\"/>\n\nDuring the 55 nomination years, 193 authors have had works nominated; 41 of these have won, including co-authors and ties. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] has received the most Nebula Awards for Best Novel with four wins out of six nominations. [[Joe Haldeman]] has received three awards out of four nominations, while nine other authors have won twice. [[Jack McDevitt]] has the most nominations at twelve, with one win, while [[Poul Anderson]] and [[Philip K. Dick]] have the most nominations without winning an award at five.\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\n\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners and joint winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"28%\" scope=\"col\"|Author\n! width=\"35%\" scope=\"col\"|Novel\n! width=\"26%\" scope=\"col\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"13\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1965 in literature|1966]]\n| {{sortname|Frank|Herbert}}* || ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' || [[Chilton Company]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Clifford D.|Simak}} || ''[[All Flesh is Grass (novel)|All Flesh is Grass]]'' || [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Theodore L.|Thomas}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| {{sort|Clone|''The Clone''}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Berkley Books]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Kate|Wilhelm}}\n|-\n| {{sortname|Philip K.|Dick}} || ''[[Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb]]'' || [[Ace Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|James|White|James White (author)}} || {{sort|Escape Orbit|''[[The Escape Orbit]]''}} || [[Ace Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Thomas M.|Disch}} || {{sort|Genocides|''[[The Genocides]]''}} || [[Berkley Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|William S.|Burroughs}} || ''[[Nova Express]]'' || [[Grove Press]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Keith|Laumer}} || {{sort|Plague of Demons|''A Plague of Demons''}} || [[Berkley Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|Avram|Davidson}} || ''Rogue Dragon'' || [[Ace Books]]\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Loc66\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|G.

Several [[Hindu temple |temples]], ancient and new, are along the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh. [[Shatrughna |Shatrughna Mandir]], Shri Hrishikesh Narayan Bharat Mandir ([[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu's avatar]]), Lakshman Mandir are the ancient temples established by [[Adi Shankaracharya]]. Shatrughna Temple is near [[Ram Jhula, Rishikesh|Ram Jhula]] and Lakshman Mandir is near Lakshman Jhula. Rishikesh derives its name from Hrishikesh, the prime deity of the town and possibly one of the oldest temples in the region. This temple was re-established by Adi Guru Shankracharya. As per ''puranas'' a pilgrim who takes 108 ''parikramas'' at Shri Hrishikesh Narayan Bharat Temple (Lord Vishnu incarnated here in this avatar; no relation to Bharat from Ramayana or Mahabharat) on the day of ''Akshaya Tritya'' (annual spring festival) gets the same spiritual blessing as they would get on visiting Badrinath Temple, the revered Hindu shrine in the Himalayas dedicated to Lord Vishnu.\n\nRishikesh has in recent decades shifted from a pilgrim to a tourist town. The International Yoga Festival introduced in 2000 has brought new influx of tourists.

In 1947 he was reverted to chief petty officer, eventually rising to [[lieutenant]] before his 1956 retirement. In his later years he made many appearances at events celebrating veterans.

Finn recalled how a neighbor was the first to alert him, when she knocked on his door saying, \"They want you down at the squadron right away!\" He drove to the hangars, catching sight of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] planes in the sky on the way, and found that the airbase was being attacked, with most of the PBYs already on fire.<ref name=\"collier\"/><ref name=\"PerryLAT\"/><ref name=\"cnn20090915\"/>\n\nFinn's men were trying to fight back by using the machine guns mounted in the PBYs, either by firing from inside the flaming planes or by detaching the guns and mounting them on improvised stands. Finn later explained that one of the first things he did was to take control of a machine gun from his squadron's painter. \"I said, 'Alex, let me take that gun'&nbsp;... knew that I had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter.\"<ref name=\"PerryLAT\"/><ref name=\"cnn20090915\"/>\n\nFinding a movable tripod platform used for gunnery training, Finn attached the [[.50 caliber machine gun]] and pushed the platform into an open area, from which he had a clear view of the attacking aircraft. He fired on the Japanese planes for the next two hours, even after being seriously wounded, until the attack had ended. In total, he received 21 distinct wounds, including a bullet through his right foot and an injury to his left shoulder, which caused him to lose feeling in his left arm.<ref name=\"collier\"/>\n\n\"I got that gun and I started shooting at Jap planes,\" Finn said in a 2009 interview. \"I was out there shooting the Jap planes and just every so often I was a target for some,\" he said, \"In some cases, I could see their [the Japanese pilots'] faces.\"<ref name=\"cnn20090915\"/>\n\nDespite his wounds, Finn returned to the hangars later that day.

During the first attack by Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, he promptly secured and manned a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on an instruction stand in a completely exposed section of  the parking  ramp, which was under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire.  Although painfully wounded many times, he continued to man this gun and to return the enemy's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety. It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention. Following first-aid treatment, although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes.

During the first attack by Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, he promptly secured and manned a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on an instruction stand in a completely exposed section of  the parking  ramp, which was under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire.  Although painfully wounded many times, he continued to man this gun and to return the enemy's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety. It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention. Following first-aid treatment, although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes.
