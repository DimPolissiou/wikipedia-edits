Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]].

An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s.

Classic cases include Jewish merchants and tradespeople in large U.S. cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as Chinese and Japanese small business owners (restaurants, farmers, shop owners) on the West Coast.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Out Of Print : Ethnic Enterprise in America: Business and Welfare Among Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks : Ivan Light - University of California Press|url = http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|website = www.ucpress.edu|access-date = 2016-01-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161020162025/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|archivedate = 2016-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 2010s, ethnic entrepreneurship has been studied in the case of Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in [[Chinatown]]s across the United States. While entrepreneurship offers these groups many opportunities for economic advancement, self-employment and business ownership in the United States remain unevenly distributed along racial/ethnic lines.<ref name=\"Chaudhary 318\u2013354\">{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318\u2013354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}</ref> Despite numerous success stories of Asian entrepreneurs, a recent statistical analysis of U.S. census data shows that whites are more likely than Asians, African-Americans and Latinos to be self-employed in high prestige, lucrative industries.<ref name=\"Chaudhary 318\u2013354\"/>\n\n=== Institutional ===\nThe American-born British economist [[Edith Penrose]] has highlighted the collective nature of entrepreneurship. She mentions that in modern organizations, human resources need to be combined to better capture and create business opportunities.<ref>Penrose, Edith T. (1959). The Theory of the Growth of the Firm. New York: John Wiley.</ref> The sociologist [[Paul DiMaggio]] (1988:14) has expanded this view to say that \"new institutions arise when organized actors with sufficient resources [institutional entrepreneurs] see in them an opportunity to realize interests that they value highly\".<ref>DiMaggio, P. 1988 'Interest and agency in institutional theory'.

In their book ''[https://www.ubcpress.ca/the-business-of-culture The Business of Culture]'' (2015), Rea and Volland identify three types of cultural entrepreneur: \"cultural personalities\", defined as \"individuals who buil[d] their own personal brand of creativity as a cultural authority and leverage it to create and sustain various cultural enterprises\"; \"tycoons\", defined as \"entrepreneurs who buil[d] substantial clout in the cultural sphere by forging synergies between their industrial, cultural, political, and philanthropic interests\"; and \"collective enterprises\", organizations which may engage in cultural production for profit or not-for-profit purposes.<ref>Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, \"The Business of Culture\" (UBC Press, 2015), pp. 4-7.

At times, profit-making [[social enterprise]]s may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in itself. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the [[homelessness|homeless]] may operate a [[restaurant]], both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless people.\n\n===Nascent===\nA nascent [[entrepreneur]] is someone in the process of establishing a business venture.<ref>Reynolds, P. D. and White, S. (1997). The Entrepreneurial Process. Westport, CT: Quorum Books.</ref> In this observation, the nascent entrepreneur can be seen as pursuing an [[Business opportunity|opportunity]], i.e. a possibility to introduce new services or products, serve new markets, or develop more efficient production methods in a profitable manner.<ref>Casson, M., 1982.

In this sense, over time, the nascent venture can move towards being discontinued or towards emerging successfully as an operating entity.\n\nThe distinction between the novice, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs is an example of behavior-based categorization.<ref>Ucbasaran, D., Westhead, P. and Wright, M., 2009.

Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.\n\nScholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,<ref name=\"Delmar, F 2004\"/><ref>Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015.

B. 2007\"/> Indeed, nascent entrepreneurs undertake numerous [[entrepreneurial]] activities, including actions that make their businesses more concrete to themselves and others. For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business<ref>Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996. Exploring start-up event sequences. Journal of business venturing, 11(3), pp.151-166.</ref>\n\n=== Project-based ===\nProject entrepreneurs are individuals who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations.<ref name=\"Ferriani2009\">Ferriani, S., Cattani, G., C. Baden-Fuller (2009) \"The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance\", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545\u20131558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]</ref> These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.<ref name=\"Faulkner1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R.

A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.\n\nProject entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.<ref name=\"DeFillippi2004\">DeFillippi, R., & Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.</ref> Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher. The reason for this is because they have grown up in a different generation and attitude than their elders. Some of the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are the economy, debt from schooling and the challenges of regulatory compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Millenial_IB.pdf|title=The Missing Millennial Entrepreneurs|last=Wilmouth|first=Daniel|website=U.S. Small Business Administration|access-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Entrepreneurial behaviors ==\nThe entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator\u2014a designer of new ideas and business processes.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp ''Investopedia'']; Investopedia.com; access date.</ref> Management skills and strong team building abilities are often perceived as essential leadership attributes for successful entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | title=Top 10 Qualities That Make A Great Leader | first=Tanya | last=Prive | work=[[Forbes]] | date=19 December 2012 | accessdate=1 August 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020062832/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | archivedate = 20 October 2017 | url-status = dead}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Non-staff contributor article from Forbes.com.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.\n\n===Strategies===\nStrategies that entrepreneurs may use include:\n* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Continuous process improvement (CPI)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Exploration of new business models\n* Use of technology<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Use of [[business intelligence]]\n* Use of economical strategics\n* Development of future products and services<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Optimized talent management<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===\nAccording to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both \"enterprising individuals\" and \"entrepreneurial opportunities\", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217\u2013226 | first=S. | last=Shane| title=The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research }}</ref> On the other hand, Reynolds et al.<ref>Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al.

While some entrepreneurs assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking, the [[mass media]] plays a crucial role in shaping views and demand.{{sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} Ramoglou argues that entrepreneurs are not that distinctive and that it is essentially poor conceptualizations of \"non-entrepreneurs\" that maintain laudatory portraits of \"entrepreneurs\" as exceptional innovators or leaders <ref>{{cite journal | last1=Ramoglou | first1=S. | year=2013 | title=Who is a 'non-entrepreneur'?

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|author1=Anna Grandori |author2=Laura Gaillard Giordani |publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}</ref> Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|author1=Charles W.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]]. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in [[endogenous growth theory]]{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term \"entrepreneur\" may be more closely associated with the term \"[[Startup company|startup]]\".

Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.\n\nScholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,<ref name=\"Delmar, F 2004\"/><ref>Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015.

For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business<ref>Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996.

Baden-Fuller (2009) \"The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance\", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545\u20131558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]</ref> These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.<ref name=\"Faulkner1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R.

A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.\n\nProject entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.<ref name=\"DeFillippi2004\">DeFillippi, R., & Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.</ref> Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.\n\n===Strategies===\nStrategies that entrepreneurs may use include:\n* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Continuous process improvement (CPI)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Exploration of new business models\n* Use of technology<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Use of [[business intelligence]]\n* Use of economical strategics\n* Development of future products and services<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Optimized talent management<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===\nAccording to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both \"enterprising individuals\" and \"entrepreneurial opportunities\", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217\u2013226 | first=S. | last=Shane| title=The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research }}</ref> On the other hand, Reynolds et al.<ref>Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al.

''Academy of Management Review.''</ref> Words like \"leadership\" and \"entrepreneurship\" do not always translate well into other cultures and languages. For example, in North America a leader is often thought of as charismatic, but German culture frowns on such charisma due to the charisma of [[Nazi Party | Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] (1889-1945).

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|author1=Anna Grandori |author2=Laura Gaillard Giordani |publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}</ref> Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|author1=Charles W.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

on a wall in Clacton which showed five grey pigeons holding three placards. They held the words \"go back to Africa\"  \"migrants not welcome\", and \"keep off our worms\". They were directed towards a more colourful migratory swallow perched further along the same wire.  The mural was removed by [[Tendring District Council]] who had  received a complaint that \"offensive and racist remarks\" had appeared on a wall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/01/banksy-mural-clacton-racist |title=Council removes Banksy artwork after complaints of racism |last=Johnston |first=Chris |date=1 October 2014 |work=The Guardian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422110701/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/01/banksy-mural-clacton-racist |url-status=live |archive-date=22 April 2020 |access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Polling==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:95%;line-height:14px\"\n|-\n!!

The 59.7% increase in the percentage vote achieved by UKIP since the previous general election (when they did not field a candidate) is the greatest ever in British parliamentary elections, although the percentage swing remains 0.1% less than the record 44.2% swing to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] at the [[1983 Bermondsey by-election]].  The 28.4% reduction in Conservative votes is the 16th worst for any party since the Second World War, while the 1.4% of the vote achieved by the Liberal Democrats was, at the time, the third smallest vote ever obtained by a major party, and the worst since [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Curtice |first=John |subject-link=John Curtice |interviewer=[[Andrew Neil]] |title=Clacton by-election: Statistics of Douglas Carswell's win |type=Video |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29563847 |publisher=BBC News |date=10 October 2014 |access-date = 22 April 2014}}</ref> Since then, however, the Liberal Democrats received an even smaller proportion of the vote at the [[2014 Rochester and Strood by-election|Rochester and Strood by-election]] later in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rochester-byelection-lib-dems-blame-tactical-voting-for-partys-worst-ever-result-9876694.html |title=Rochester by-election: Lib Dems blame tactical voting for party\u2019s worst ever result |last=McSmith |first=Andy |work=The Independent |date=21 November 2014  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221093022/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rochester-byelection-lib-dems-blame-tactical-voting-for-partys-worst-ever-result-9876694.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 December 2014 |access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Previous result==\n{{Election box begin|title=[[2010 United Kingdom general election|General election 2010]]: Clacton<ref name=2010result>{{cite news |title=Clacton |first= |last= |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=7 May 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/b14.stm }}</ref>}}\n\nUKIP did not stand a candidate against Douglas Carswell in 2010, citing his Eurosceptic views.\n\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n|party      = Conservative Party (UK)\n|candidate  = [[Douglas Carswell]]\n|votes      = 22,867\n|percentage = 53.0\n|change     = {{increase}} 8.6\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n|party      = Labour Party (UK)\n|candidate  = [[Ivan Henderson]]\n|votes      = 10,799\n|percentage = 25.0\n|change     = {{decrease}} 10.9\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n|party      = Liberal Democrats (UK)\n|candidate  = Michael Green\n|votes      = 5,577\n|percentage = 12.9\n|change     = {{decrease}} 0.6\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n|party      = British National Party\n|candidate  = Jim Taylor\n|votes      = 1,975\n|percentage = 4.6\n|change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n|party      = Tendring First\n|candidate  = Terry Allen\n|votes      = 1,078\n|percentage = 2.5\n|change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n|party      = Green Party of England and Wales\n|candidate  = Chris Southall\n|votes      = 535\n|percentage = 1.2\n|change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n|party      = Independent (politician)\n|candidate  = Chris Humphrey\n|votes      = 292\n|percentage = 0.7\n|change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n|votes      = 12,068\n|percentage = 28.0\n|change     = \n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n|votes      = 43,123\n|percentage = 64.2\n|change     = {{increase}} 1.6\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n|winner = Conservative Party (UK)\n|swing  = {{increase}} 9.7\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom}}\n*[[2015 United Kingdom general election]]\n*[[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of United Kingdom by-elections (2010\u2013present)]]\n*[[Opinion polling for the 2015 United Kingdom general election]]\n*[[Opinion polling for the 2015 United Kingdom general election in individual constituencies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{By-elections to the 55th UK Parliament}}\n{{Brexit topics|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:2014 in England|Clacton by-election]]\n[[Category:2014 elections in the United Kingdom|Clacton by-election]]\n[[Category:October 2014 events in the United Kingdom|Clacton by-election]]\n[[Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Essex constituencies]]\n[[Category:Tendring]]\n[[Category:2010s in Essex]]\n[[Category:UK Independence Party]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Clacton_by-election"}
