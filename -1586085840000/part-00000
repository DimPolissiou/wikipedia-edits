Funding for the year ending August 2012 totals some $508,762,274. This is broken down by 18 major funding lines including Pupil Foundation Grant (252.5 M), School Foundation Grant (34.4 M), Special Education Grant (66.7 M), Language Grant (6.5 M), FNMI Grant (1.2 M), Learning Opportunities Grant (4.0 M), Safe School Supplement (0.9 M), Program Enhancement Grant (1.0 M), Continuing Education Grant (2.6 M), Cost Adjustment/ Teacher Qualifications (38.8 M), Student Transportation Grant (18.8 M), Declining Enrolment Adjustment (2.6 M), School Board Administration and Governance (13.1 M), School Operations Allocation (44.7 M), School Renewal Allocation (6.7), Interest Expense (11.8 M), Non-Permanently Financed Capital Debt (2.0 M). These amounts are further broken down by the Ministry of Education, many with restrictions on their use, and others that are locally managed. Funding for the 2012-13 school year is projected to be approximately 2.4 million dollars less than 2011-12, due to the province's focus on containing costs in order to address a 16 billion dollar deficit.

King Edward was designated as \u201cprohibitive to repair\u201d by the Ministry of Education after province-wide inspections in 2003.\n\nIn response to a request by individuals in the King Edward community, the Ministry of Education appointed [[Dave Cooke]], an independent facilitator, to review the three-year process that led to the Board\u2019s closure decision. The facilitator met with the King Edward Accommodations Review Task Force members, other community members, trustees, and staff during the summer.\n\nA Ministry of Education press release noted that the facilitator \u201cdetermined that the board did follow its board-approved accommodation review policy as well as the intent of the [[Dalton McGuinty|McGuinty]] government\u2019s Good Places to Learn initiative.\u201d  In addition, the release states that the facilitator \u201cmade recommendations for the board to improve its accommodation review process, but also determined that the outcome of the review of King Edward would not have changed under a different process.\u201d\n\nSCDSB Associate Director Lou Brandes agreed that it is time to proceed with next steps. \u201cDavid Cooke's review has validated our Accommodation Task Force Review process as well as the integrity and the inclusiveness of the work of the committee members,\u201d he says. \u201cTransition teams made up of principals, staff and parents from King Edward, Allandale Heights Public School and Assikinack Public School communities will be continuing to work with their communities over the next two years in preparation of the transfer of students to their new locations in September 2008.\u201d\n\nThe decision to close the school was made on April 26, 2006, nearly three years after the Ministry of Education conducted province-wide school inspections and deemed the school to be \u201cprohibitive to repair\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cprohibitive to repair\u201d designation is made when the cost of renewing the school building surpasses 65% of the cost of the replacement value of the existing building.\n\nAs a result of receiving this designation, the Simcoe County District School Board followed the procedures set out in Board Policy 2313, School Closure and Consolidation. The King Edward Accommodations Review Task Force Committee was formed in November 2003 to begin the accommodations review process and make recommendations for Board consideration.\n\n==Schools==\n{{SCDSBSchools|state=expanded}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]]\n*[[List of school districts in Ontario]]\n*[[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.scdsb.on.ca/ Simcoe County District School Board website]\n\n{{Barrie}}\n\n[[Category:School districts in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Education in Simcoe County]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Barrie]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox school district\n| name                  = Simcoe County District School Board (SCDSB)\n| logo                  = File:SCDSB_logo.svg\n| region                = [[Simcoe County]], Ontario\n| country               = Canada\n| location              = 1170 Highway 26 West<br>[[Midhurst, Ontario]]<br>L9X 1N6\n| coordinates           = {{coord|44.44642|N|79.74853|W|type:edu_region:CA-ON|display=inline,title}}\n| chair_of_the_board    = Jodi Lloyd\n| director_of_education = Steve Blake<ref>{{cite web|title=SCDSB announces Steve Blake as new Director of Education|url=http://www.scdsb.on.ca/About%20Us/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=1558|publisher=Simcoe County District School Board|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=February 8, 2017}}</ref>\n| free_label1           = Elected trustees\n| free_text1            = '''David O'Brien ''' (Barrie, Wards 1-3) <br>\n'''Donna Armstrong ''' (Innisfil & Bradford West Gwillimbury) <br>\n'''Peter Beacock ''' (Oro-Medonte & Springwater (Chairperson)) <br>\n'''Lisa-Marie Wilson ''' (Barrie Wards 7-10) <br>\n'''Tanya Snell''' (Collingwood and Wasaga Beach) <br>\n'''Rob North''' (Adjala-Tosorontio Clearview, Essa & CFB Borden) <br>\n'''Sarah Beitz''' (New Tecumseth) <br>\n'''Jodi Lloyd''' (Orillia, Ramara) <br>\n'''Vacant''' (Midland, Tay, Severn) <br>\n'''Beth Mouratidis''' (Barrie Wards 4-6)<br>\n'''P.J Sandy''' (First Nation Communities)\n| schools               = 116 (14 Secondary, 87 Elementary, 9 Alternative Secondary, 6 Learning Centres)\n| budget                = CA$508.7 million (2011-12)\n| students              = 50,000 (approx.)\n| staff                 = 6,000+\n| website               = {{Official website}}\n| motto                 = Your Future...

King Edward was designated as \u201cprohibitive to repair\u201d by the Ministry of Education after province-wide inspections in 2003.\n\nIn response to a request by individuals in the King Edward community, the Ministry of Education appointed [[Dave Cooke]], an independent facilitator, to review the three-year process that led to the Board\u2019s closure decision. The facilitator met with the King Edward Accommodations Review Task Force members, other community members, trustees, and staff during the summer.\n\nA Ministry of Education press release noted that the facilitator \u201cdetermined that the board did follow its board-approved accommodation review policy as well as the intent of the [[Dalton McGuinty|McGuinty]] government\u2019s Good Places to Learn initiative.\u201d  In addition, the release states that the facilitator \u201cmade recommendations for the board to improve its accommodation review process, but also determined that the outcome of the review of King Edward would not have changed under a different process.\u201d\n\nSCDSB Associate Director Lou Brandes agreed that it is time to proceed with next steps. \u201cDavid Cooke's review has validated our Accommodation Task Force Review process as well as the integrity and the inclusiveness of the work of the committee members,\u201d he says. \u201cTransition teams made up of principals, staff and parents from King Edward, Allandale Heights Public School and Assikinack Public School communities will be continuing to work with their communities over the next two years in preparation of the transfer of students to their new locations in September 2008.\u201d\n\nThe decision to close the school was made on April 26, 2006, nearly three years after the Ministry of Education conducted province-wide school inspections and deemed the school to be \u201cprohibitive to repair\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cprohibitive to repair\u201d designation is made when the cost of renewing the school building surpasses 65% of the cost of the replacement value of the existing building.\n\nAs a result of receiving this designation, the Simcoe County District School Board followed the procedures set out in Board Policy 2313, School Closure and Consolidation. The King Edward Accommodations Review Task Force Committee was formed in November 2003 to begin the accommodations review process and make recommendations for Board consideration.\n\n==Schools==\n{{SCDSBSchools|state=expanded}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board]]\n*[[List of school districts in Ontario]]\n*[[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.scdsb.on.ca/ Simcoe County District School Board website]\n\n{{Barrie}}\n\n[[Category:School districts in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Education in Simcoe County]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Barrie]]\n", "name_user": "PKT", "label": "safe", "comment": "merged references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County_District_School_Board"}

This was because Bowyer's racing simulator was located in the Fox studio, meaning he raced there instead of at his house, which allowed him to contribute to the broadcast as often as he wanted to. Joy mentioned during the broadcast that Bowyer was in a room down the hall from him and Gordon.\n\nFox broadcasters [[Michael Waltrip]] and [[Regan Smith]] also contributed to the broadcasts, interviewing drivers [[Denny Hamlin]] and [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] (for the Homestead race) and [[Garrett Smithley]] and [[Kyle Larson]] (for the Texas race) at each of their houses before the start of the race. [[Jamie Little]], [[Vince Welch]], and [[Matt Yocum]], the other Fox pit reporters, were not on either broadcast.\n\nFor the O'Reilly Auto Parts 125 qualifying race and the Saturday Night Thunder race, normal iRacing booth announcers Evan Posocco, Tim Terry, and Justin Prince called both of those races, which were not televised by Fox and were instead livestreamed on NASCAR's YouTube channel.\n\n====Television viewership====\n903,000 viewers watched the first race at Homestead, while 1,339,000 watched the second race at Texas.

The work is scored for two [[SATB]] choirs, two [[trumpet]]s, [[bassoon]], [[string section|strings]] and [[basso continuo]]. Its music opens with an instrumental introduction ([[sinfonia]]). Most of the composition's [[movement (music)|movements]] are either choral movements, in which all singers and instruments participate, or [[duet]]s for two singers and a more limited instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe Magnificat in C&nbsp;major, [[BWV&nbsp;Anh.]]&nbsp;30, is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. In Bach's version of the work, which originated around 1742, there are an additional trumpet and [[timpani]]. Both Torri's original and Bach's arrangement were recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. Shortly after the second of these recordings was released in 2012, it was discovered that BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;30 was an arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. Before that, Bach's version had been attributed to various composers, including [[Antonio Lotti]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nPietro Torri likely wrote his Magnificat in the 1690s, when he was in the service of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Thielemann|2012|p=218}} In that period Torri followed his employer to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1692) and was later deputized to [[Hanover]] (1696), only returning to [[Bavaria]] in 1701.{{sfn|Sadie|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rskiYf4mn7wC&pg=PA245 245]}} In the early 1790s Torri wrote scenic works such as ''L'ambizione fulminata'' and ''Gli amori di Titone e d'Aurora'' for [[Munich]], and ''I Preggi della primavera'' for [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]], [[Electress Palatine]] at [[Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Champlin|1888\u201390|loc=III:[https://archive.org/details/cyclopediaofmusi03cham/page/489 489]}}<ref name=operone>[http://www.operone.de/komponist/torri.html Torri, Pietro] at {{url|www.operone.de}}.</ref><ref>{{RISM|450022127}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2020-01-10}}.</ref>\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Wening Residenz M\u00fcnchen.jpg\n|height  = 275\n|width   = \n|alt     = \n|caption = [[Munich Residenz]], the palace of Torri's employer [[Max Emanuel]], around the time when Torri worked there.\n|dir     = \n}}\n''S.

The work is scored for two [[SATB]] choirs, two [[trumpet]]s, [[bassoon]], [[string section|strings]] and [[basso continuo]]. Its music opens with an instrumental introduction ([[sinfonia]]). Most of the composition's [[movement (music)|movements]] are either choral movements, in which all singers and instruments participate, or [[duet]]s for two singers and a more limited instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe Magnificat in C&nbsp;major, [[BWV&nbsp;Anh.]]&nbsp;30, is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. In Bach's version of the work, which originated around 1742, there are an additional trumpet and [[timpani]]. Both Torri's original and Bach's arrangement were recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. Shortly after the second of these recordings was released in 2012, it was discovered that BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;30 was an arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. Before that, Bach's version had been attributed to various composers, including [[Antonio Lotti]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nPietro Torri likely wrote his Magnificat in the 1690s, when he was in the service of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Thielemann|2012|p=218}} In that period Torri followed his employer to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1692) and was later deputized to [[Hanover]] (1696), only returning to [[Bavaria]] in 1701.{{sfn|Sadie|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rskiYf4mn7wC&pg=PA245 245]}} In the early 1790s Torri wrote scenic works such as ''L'ambizione fulminata'' and ''Gli amori di Titone e d'Aurora'' for [[Munich]], and ''I Preggi della primavera'' for [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]], [[Electress Palatine]] at [[Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Champlin|1888\u201390|loc=III:[https://archive.org/details/cyclopediaofmusi03cham/page/489 489]}}<ref name=operone>[http://www.operone.de/komponist/torri.html Torri, Pietro] at {{url|www.operone.de}}.</ref><ref>{{RISM|450022127}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2020-01-10}}.</ref>\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Wening Residenz M\u00fcnchen.jpg\n|height  = 275\n|width   = \n|alt     = \n|caption = [[Munich Residenz]], the palace of Torri's employer [[Max Emanuel]], around the time when Torri worked there.\n|dir     = \n}}\n''S.
