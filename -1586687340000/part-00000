The lead character is a stripper named Erotica Jones who is secretly the [[superhero]]/[[secret agent]] Stripperella.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=602-603}}</ref> The series was produced by The Firm and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studios|Spike Animation Studios]]. It is rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States.\n\n==Background==\nStripperella's powers include enhanced reflexes and senses, an astonishing intelligence, superhuman strength, jumping extremely high, \"sexy\" martial arts and \"killer\" moves. She has twice claimed to be impervious to all temperatures and weather conditions, but this has only been casually tested on screen. She generally has access to a number of [[James Bond|Bond]]-esque, super-technological devices of questionable usefulness. She is also able to use her extravagant blonde hair as an effective parachute.\n\nShe has a brother named Chipperella ([[Jon Cryer]]), who also happened to be a stripper living the double life as a superhero and secret agent. He was briefly mentioned when Stripperella temporarily lost faith in her crime fighting abilities after having been shrunken by Small Fry. He appears in a flashback as a hunky blonde and is affectionately referred to by Erotica and Chief Stroganoff as \"Chip.\" In a humorous anecdote, Stroganoff tells Stripperella that her brother's memory was erased, later being mostly restored except for the word 'quit' which was forever erased from his memory.\n\n''Stripperella'' debuted on [[Paramount Network|Spike TV]] in the spring of 2003 and lasted one season with 13 episodes. Anderson described it as not being a raunchy show, despite obvious [[double entendre]]s and [[Toplessness|topless]] [[nudity]] (which was blurred out when shown on Spike TV).\n\nThe animation style changed halfway through the show's run, becoming brighter and revamping the looks of many of the show's major characters. Stripperella, for example, was now drawn with a [[cowl]] having larger [[Human eye|eye]]holes, similar to [[Batgirl]]'s. Fellow stripper Persephone now had a darker complexion and an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] that inexplicably changed from episode to episode.\n\nIn [[Australia]], ''Stripperella'' began airing uncensored on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] TV, starting Monday March 13, 2006 at 21:00 local time (9:00PM), after having previously been restricted to early-morning airings on the [[Nine Network]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''Stripperella'' is aired uncensored as part of the U.K. incarnation of the [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming block. In [[Germany]], the show aired uncensored on [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Germany]] available for all audiences. In [[Italy]], it is aired on [[FX (Italy)|FX Italia]], uncensored and unrated; in [[Latin America]] is transmitted by [[MTV Latin America]]; and in [[Brazil]] was transmitted by [[Multishow]].\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* Erotica's workplace TenderLoins features the wishy-washy owner Kevin (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]), [[Swish (slang)|swishy]] bartender Leonard (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]), and dancers Persephone (voiced by [[Sirena Irwin]]) who is promiscuous and switches accents, and naive and good-natured country girl Giselle (voiced by [[Jill Talley]]). The newest member, the antagonistic Catt (voiced by [[Joey Lauren Adams]]), gets hired in TenderLoins under false pretenses of being an [[Amish]] virgin.\n* The main competition of TenderLoins is SiliCones, a strip club owned by Dirk McMahon (voiced by [[Vince McMahon]]) who openly admits his obsession for Erotica to work at his club.\n* Stripperella works for the agency FUGG under Chief Stroganoff (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]). Other recurring FUGG members include technicians Hal and Bernard (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] and [[Greg Proops]]), and Special Agent 14 (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]).\n* There are two recurring villains: Cheapo (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]), the world's cheapest bad guy, and Queen Clitoris (pronounced kli-TOR-is) (voiced by [[Sirena Irwin]]), a woman who lashes out on society for her facial appearance.\n* Reporters Skip Withers (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) and Margo Van Winkle (voiced by Jill Talley) appearing when TV news coverage is needed.  [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic|Weird Al]] has appeared twice without any lines.\n\n==Episodes==\nNote: What follows is the chronology according to the DVD release.

F. W. Schimper]] was the first to provide a clear definition. Plastids are the site of manufacture and storage of important chemical compounds used by the cells of [[autotroph]]ic [[eukaryote]]s. They often contain [[Biological pigment|pigments]] used in [[photosynthesis]], and the types of pigments in a plastid determine the cell's color. They have a common evolutionary origin and possess a [[DNA#Base pairing|double-stranded DNA]] molecule that is circular, like that of the [[circular prokaryote chromosome|circular chromosome]] of [[prokaryotic cells]].\n\n== In plants ==\n[[File:010-Sol-tub-40xHF-Gewebe.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|[[Leucoplast]]s in plant cells.]]\nPlastids that contain [[chlorophyll]] can carry out [[photosynthesis]] and are called [[chloroplasts]]. Plastids can also store products like [[starch]] and can synthesize [[fatty acids]] and [[terpenes]], which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, the components of the [[plant cuticle]] and its [[epicuticular wax]] are synthesized by the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] from [[palmitic acid]], which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the [[mesophyll tissue]].<ref name=Kolattukudy>Kolattukudy, P.E.

Kerstiens (ed.), BIOS Scientific publishers Ltd., Oxford</ref> All plastids are derived from proplastids, which are present in the [[meristem]]atic regions of the plant. Proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by [[binary fission]], but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity.\n{{Clear}}\n[[Image:Plastids types.svg|right|300px]]\n\nIn [[plant]]s, undifferentiated plastids (proplastids) may [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into several forms, depending upon which function they perform in the cell.

The number of genome copies per plastid is variable, ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly [[cell division|dividing cells]], which, in general, contain few plastids, to 100 or fewer in mature cells, where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids. The plastome contains about 100 [[gene]]s encoding ribosomal and transfer [[ribonucleic acid]]s ([[rRNA]]s and [[tRNA]]s) as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. However, these proteins only represent a small fraction of the total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain the structure and function of a particular type of plastid. Plant [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins, and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to [[cell differentiation]].\n\nPlastid DNA exists as large protein-DNA complexes associated with the inner envelope [[Inner nuclear membrane|membrane]] and called 'plastid nucleoids'. Each nucleoid particle may contain more than 10 copies of the plastid DNA. The proplastid contains a single nucleoid located in the centre of the plastid. The developing plastid has many nucleoids, localized at the periphery of the plastid, bound to the inner envelope membrane. During the development of proplastids to chloroplasts, and when plastids convert from one type to another, nucleoids change in morphology, size and location within the organelle. The remodelling of nucleoids is believed to occur by modifications to the composition and abundance of nucleoid proteins.\n\nMany plastids, particularly those responsible for photosynthesis, possess numerous internal membrane layers.\n\nIn [[plant cell]]s, long thin protuberances called [[stromule]]s sometimes form and extend from the main plastid body into the [[cytosol]] and interconnect several plastids. Proteins, and presumably smaller molecules, can move within stromules. Most cultured cells that are relatively large compared to other plant cells have very long and abundant stromules that extend to the cell periphery.\n\nIn 2014, evidence of possible plastid genome loss was found in ''[[Rafflesia]] lagascae'', a non-photosynthetic [[Parasitism|parasitic]] flowering plant, and in ''[[Polytomella]]'', a genus of non-photosynthetic [[green algae]].

In some cases these plastids may be reduced in their metabolic and/or photosynthetic capacity.  Algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the [[heterokont]]s, [[haptophyte]]s, [[cryptomonads]], and most [[dinoflagellate]]s (= rhodoplasts). Those that endosymbiosed a green alga include the [[euglenid]]s and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s (= chloroplasts). The [[Apicomplexa]], a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria (''[[Plasmodium]]'' spp.), [[toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''), and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'', which causes [[cryptosporidiosis]]).  The '[[apicoplast]]' is no longer capable of photosynthesis, but is an essential organelle, and a promising target for antiparasitic drug development.\n\nSome [[dinoflagellates]] and sea slugs, in particular of the genus ''[[Elysia (gastropod)|Elysia]]'', take up algae as food and keep the plastid of the digested alga to profit from the photosynthesis; after a while, the plastids are also digested.

They often contain [[Biological pigment|pigments]] used in [[photosynthesis]]B, and the types of pigments in a plastid determine the cell's color.

Plastids can also store products like [[starch]] and can synthesize [[fatty acids]] and [[terpenes]], which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, the components of the [[plant cuticle]] and its [[epicuticular wax]] are synthesized by the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] from [[palmitic acid]], which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the [[mesophyll tissue]].<ref name=Kolattukudy>Kolattukudy, P.E.

The number of genome copies per plastid is variable, ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly [[cell division|dividing cells]], which, in general, contain few plastids, to 100 or fewer in mature cells, where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids. The plastome contains about 100 [[gene]]s encoding ribosomal and transfer [[ribonucleic acid]]s ([[rRNA]]s and [[tRNA]]s) as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. However, these proteins only represent a small fraction of the total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain the structure and function of a particular type of plastid. Plant [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins, and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to [[cell differentiation]].\n\nPlastid DNA exists as large protein-DNA complexes associated with the inner envelope [[Inner nuclear membrane|membrane]] and called 'plastid nucleoids'. Each nucleoid particle may contain more than 10 copies of the plastid DNA. The proplastid contains a single nucleoid located in the centre of the plastid. The developing plastid has many nucleoids, localized at the periphery of the plastid, bound to the inner envelope membrane. During the development of proplastids to chloroplasts, and when plastids convert from one type to another, nucleoids change in morphology, size and location within the organelle. The remodelling of nucleoids is believed to occur by modifications to the composition and abundance of nucleoid proteins.\n\nMany plastids, particularly those responsible for photosynthesis, possess numerous internal membrane layers.\n\nIn [[plant cell]]s, long thin protuberances called [[stromule]]s sometimes form and extend from the main plastid body into the [[cytosol]] and interconnect several plastids. Proteins, and presumably smaller molecules, can move within stromules. Most cultured cells that are relatively large compared to other plant cells have very long and abundant stromules that extend to the cell periphery.\n\nIn 2014, evidence of possible plastid genome loss was found in ''[[Rafflesia]] lagascae'', a non-photosynthetic [[Parasitism|parasitic]] flowering plant, and in ''[[Polytomella]]'', a genus of non-photosynthetic [[green algae]].

All these primary plastids are surrounded by two membranes.\n\nIn contrast to primary plastids derived from primary endosymbiosis of a prokaryoctyic cyanobacteria, complex plastids originated by secondary [[endosymbiosis]] in which a  eukaryotic organism engulfed another eukaryotic organism that contained a primary plastid. <ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Origin of Plastids |url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-plastids-14125758|journal=Nature Education|page=84|volume=3|issue=9|year=2010| vauthors = Chan CX, Bhattachary D }}</ref> When a [[eukaryote]] engulfs a red or a green alga and retains the algal plastid, that plastid is typically surrounded by more than two membranes. In some cases these plastids may be reduced in their metabolic and/or photosynthetic capacity.  Algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the [[heterokont]]s, [[haptophyte]]s, [[cryptomonads]], and most [[dinoflagellate]]s (= rhodoplasts). Those that endosymbiosed a green alga include the [[euglenid]]s and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s (= chloroplasts). The [[Apicomplexa]], a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria (''[[Plasmodium]]'' spp.), [[toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''), and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'', which causes [[cryptosporidiosis]]).  The '[[apicoplast]]' is no longer capable of photosynthesis, but is an essential organelle, and a promising target for antiparasitic drug development.\n\nSome [[dinoflagellates]] and sea slugs, in particular of the genus ''[[Elysia (gastropod)|Elysia]]'', take up algae as food and keep the plastid of the digested alga to profit from the photosynthesis; after a while, the plastids are also digested. This process is known as [[kleptoplasty]], from the Greek, ''kleptes'', thief.\n\n== Paulinella chromatophora ==\n[[Paulinella]] has a similar organelle which does not belong to the plastids discussed in this text. It is a chromatophore, which is a more recently acquired endosymbiotic \u03b2-Cyanobacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marin|first=Birger|last2=Nowack|first2=Eva CM|last3=Gl\u00f6ckner|first3=Gernot|last4=Melkonian|first4=Michael|date=2007|title=The ancestor of the Paulinella chromatophore obtained a carboxysomal operon by horizontal gene transfer from a Nitrococcus-like \u03b3-proteobacterium|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=85|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-85|pmc=1904183|pmid=17550603}}</ref> This endosymbiosis event occurred much more recent, and is only the second known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mitochondrion]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web | first = Maureen R. | last1 = Hanson | first2 = Rainer H. | last2 = K\u00f6hler | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=e&id=122 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050614082020/http://www.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=e&id=122 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2005-06-14 | title = A Novel View of Chloroplast Structure | work = Plant Physiology Online }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Wycliffe P, Sitbon F, Wernersson J, Ezcurra I, Ellerstr\u00f6m M, Rask L | title = Continuous expression in tobacco leaves of a Brassica napus PEND homologue blocks differentiation of plastids and development of palisade cells | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201315 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16167891 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02482.x }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Birky CW | title = The inheritance of genes in mitochondria and chloroplasts: laws, mechanisms, and models | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 35 | issue =  | pages = 125\u201348 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11700280 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.090231 | url = http://www.hos.ufl.edu/ctdcweb/Birky01.pdf | access-date = 2009-03-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100622141202/http://www.hos.ufl.edu/ctdcweb/Birky01.pdf | archive-date = 2010-06-22 | url-status = dead }}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan CX, Bhattacharya D |title=The origins of plastids |journal=Nature Education |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=84 |year=2010 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-plastids-14125758}}\n* {{cite book | veditors = Bhattacharya D |title=Origins of Algae and their Plastids |publisher=Springer-Verlag/Wein |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-3-211-83036-9 }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Gould SB, Waller RF, McFadden GI | title = Plastid evolution | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 491\u2013517 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18315522 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092915 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9e1e451bad28d9088b90cd55777d74358977f048 }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Keeling PJ | title = The endosymbiotic origin, diversification and fate of plastids | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The victims appear to have died from toxic shock, but their medical records have been deleted and closer examination by Owen and Martha reveals that all have been murdered. Further investigation shows that the victims have previously suffered from incurable diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[HIV]], but were cured of them prior to their deaths. All were participants in clinical drug trials at a secure medical research facility called The Pharm, run by the well respected medical researcher, Professor Copley. One victim, still alive when Torchwood find her, dies while being questioned and fly-like creatures erupt from her mouth.\n\nJack and Owen confront the professor who claims only to use human subjects for advanced clinical trials of disease curing drugs, but Jack detects a strong presence of alien life forms within The Pharm, and the facility's security system proves to be beyond the ability of Torchwood to hack from the outside. Martha offers to infiltrate the facility disguised as a human test subject and is accepted after claiming to be infected with hepatitis. Once inside, Martha discovers that The Pharm uses a substance called \"Reset\" that releases alien parasites called Mayflies into the host's body. The parasites cure the patient of any diseases and restores them to \"factory settings\", but at the price of infecting the patient with the parasite. When the eggs hatch, the creatures destroy the host. Copley determines that Martha's body has experienced the effects of time travel and further connects Martha to Jack and Torchwood. Feeling that she would be a remarkable test subject, Copley injects her with multiple doses of Reset, curious to determine the effect of Mayflies on her immune system.\n\nWith The Pharm's computer systems compromised by Martha, Torchwood discover the assassin employed by The Pharm to dispose of research subjects and realise he is about to kill the last living test subject. Ianto and Gwen apprehend the killer and return him to the Hub for questioning. He agrees (under duress) to help Torchwood to infiltrate The Pharm and rescue Martha, but it becomes clear that he is infected with Mayflies, likely contracted from one of his previous victims, and is about to die. Owen attempts to remove the creature with the [[List of Torchwood items#Singularity Scalpel|singularity scalpel]], but fails to operate the device correctly, leaving the Mayfly alive and killing the man. The team rushes to the Pharm hidden in the assassin's vehicle, using the dead man in the driver's seat to fool the security guards into letting them inside the compound.\n\nWithin the Pharm, they find numerous tormented aliens being used to produce various test substances, including the mature Mayfly that is the source of Reset. They also find Martha near death in the professor's laboratory and Owen this time is able to successfully use the singularity scalpel to neutralise the Mayfly within her. Jack orders Tosh to shut down the Pharm, euthanizing all of the trapped aliens and crashing all computer systems. Before the team can depart, though, they are stopped at gunpoint by Professor Copley. Owen places himself between Martha and the gun while attempting to reason with the professor. Copley fires, hitting Owen in the chest and Jack responds by firing and killing Copley.
