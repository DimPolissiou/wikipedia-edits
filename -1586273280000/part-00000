{"title_page": "Igor J. Koralnik", "text_new": "[[File:Koralnik Igor MD 20191106 MPP1093 1770525578-1.jpg|thumb|Igor Koralnik, MD]]\n'''Igor Koralnik''' is an American physician, neurologist and scientist. He is one of the first physicians to study the neurologic complications caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]])<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\"/> and is a leading researcher<ref name=ectrims-bio/> in the investigation of the [[Polyomaviridae|polyomavirus]] JC (JC virus), which causes [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML), a disease of the central nervous system that occurs in immunosuppressed individuals. He worked as an acting fill-in anchor for the [[WGN-TV]] in Chicago. \n\n==Education and training==\nKoralnik was born in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] on July 20, 1962. He moved to the United States in 1990 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He received his medical degree at the [[University of Geneva]] Medical School, Switzerland, in 1987. While a medical student, he became interested in a new disease \u2013 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), whose origin in the HIV virus was discovered in 1983.\n\nKoralnik's doctoral dissertation focused on the early neurological complications of AIDS. He used magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography and other electrophysiologic diagnostic technology to track damage to the brain and nerve cells. He continued these studies during his internship and residency in Internal medicine at [[Geneva University Hospital]], under the mentorship of Dr. Bernard Hirschel. This work formed the basis of a 1990 article,<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\"/> which Koralnik lead-authored, in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], and it won him a 1991 award<ref name=rushu-bio/> from the Swiss Society of Internal Medicine.\n\nIn 1990, Koralnik came to the United States for a postdoctoral fellowship on molecular biology of retroviruses<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> at the laboratory of  [[Robert C. Gallo]], MD, a leading AIDS researcher, at the [[National Cancer Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. During three years at the Gallo laboratory, Koralnik performed molecular studies on the [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1|Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I]] (HTLV-I). Upon completion of the fellowship in 1993, he moved to Boston to enter the Harvard-Longwood residency program in neurology at [[Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital]]  and [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] (BIDMC).<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/>\n\nDuring his neurology residency, Koralnik began studying the polyomavirus JC, the agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), under the mentorship of Norman Letvin, MD,<ref name=\"Haynes & Permar 2012\"/> professor of medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]] and chief of the Division of Viral Pathogenesis at BIDMC. After graduating from the neurology residency in 1996, Koralnik had to retake an internship year in internal medicine, which he had already completed in Switzerland, to be eligible for board certification in neurology in the United States. He received his certificate in neurology from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1998.\n\n==Clinical career==\nIn 1997, Koralnik became assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. He founded and directed the HIV/Neurology Center at BIDMC,<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> which is an outpatient treatment center for patients with neurologic problems due to HIV infection. He also opened a research laboratory at BIDMC studying the pathogenesis of JC virus in PML.<ref name=ectrims-bio/>\n\nDuring 19 years in Boston, he was the director of the neuro-HIV fellowship program at BIDMC. He rose through the ranks and became a full professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in 2009 and chief of the Division of Neuro-Immunology at BIDMC in 2012.<ref name=ectrims-bio/> Koralnik became deeply engaged in mentoring young physicians and scientists at BIDMC and other Harvard-affiliated hospitals. Together with a BIDMC mentee, Dr. Omar Siddiqi, Koralnik founded<ref name=rushu-bio/> in 2010 the Global Neurology research program at the University Teaching Hospital in [[Lusaka, Zambia]].\n\nIn July 2016, he moved to Chicago to become chairperson of the Department of Neurological Sciences and the Jean Schweppe Armour professor of neurology and medicine at [[Rush University Medical Center]] (RUMC)<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> and created the Section of Neuro-infectious Diseases<ref name=\"Rush U Neuroinfectious Disease Services\"/> at RUMC.\n\nKoralnik developed a neuro-immunology fellowship at BIDMC<ref name=ectrims-bio/> and then one at RUMC.<ref name=\"Rush U Neuroimmunology Fellowship\"/> Fellows rotate in the [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) clinic, the neuro-HIV clinic and the neuro-infectious disease clinic at RUMC and learn to care for patients over the entire immunologic spectrum.\n\nKoralnik currently serves as the Chief of the Division of Neuroinfectious Diseases and Global Neurology at Northwestern University and the Neuroinfectious Diseases Program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=46650|title=Faculty Profile|website=www.feinberg.northwestern.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nHe has also worked as an acting fill-in anchor for the WGN-TV in Chicago. Most recently, Koralnik offered insight on COVID-19, leveraging his expertise from the AIDS epidemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wgntv.com/news/coronavirus/your-questions-about-novel-coronavirus-answered/|title=Your questions about novel coronavirus \u2014 answered|date=2020-03-03|website=WGN-TV|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/5891712/|title=Coronavirus spreads from Chicago woman to husband in 1st US human-to-human transmission, CDC says|date=2020-01-31|website=ABC7 Chicago|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/30/coronavirus-chicago-man-first-us-case-person-person-spread/2857083001/|title=Chicago man is first US case of person-to-person coronavirus spread|last=Hauck|first=Grace|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Memberships and editorial activities==\nKoralnik joined the American Neurological Association in 2004 and was elected member of the prestigious American Society for Clinical Investigation in 2008.<ref name=\"ASCI-bio\"/> He is a founding member of the Neuro-infectious Disease Section and Global Health Section of the American Academy of Neurology.<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> He has been a member of the International Society for NeuroVirology since its inception in 1998 and became its president in 2016.<ref name=\"ISNV Governance\"/>\n\nKoralnik is also a member of the American Neurological Association, the American Association of Immunologists, and of the American Society for Microbiology.<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> He has been on the editorial board of the Journal of NeuroVirology since 2008<ref name=\"NeuroVirology Editorial Board\"/> and he was associate editor of the Annals of Neurology from 2013-2016.<ref name=\"Annals of Neurology Editoral Board\"/>\n\n==Major accomplishments==\nKoralnik started his career studying early neurological aspects of HIV/AIDS.<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\"/> Neurological complications occur in 30% to 50% of HIV-infected persons, and they can present as the initial symptom, throughout the course of the disease or in the advanced stage.<ref name=\"BIDMC HIV Neurology Center\"/>\n\nHe then focused his research on JC virus (JCV) and PML.<ref name=ectrims-bio/> Koralnik and colleagues have characterized the cellular immune response against JCV, and showed that it was a key aspect to survival in PML patients.<ref name=pmid15215217/><ref name=pmid19901246/> He is now studying the development of epilepsy, which occurs in 44% of patients with PML.<ref name=pmid26676826/>\n\nKoralnik is credited<ref name=pmid23092189/> for demonstrating that JCV can infect not only glial cells (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) but also neurons. He and his colleagues have identified two novel clinical entities distinct from PML \u2013 JCV-granule cell neuronopathy<ref name=pmid15786466/> and JCV-encephalopathy<ref name=pmid19557867/> \u2013 that are caused by JCV deletion variants. He and his colleagues also demonstrated<ref name=pmid24895208/> that JCV can infect meningeal and choroid plexus cells and cause JCV meningitis. They are studying the development of epilepsy in PML patients as well. Koralnik has also been studying the determinants of latency and reactivation of JCV in patients with MS who have been treated with natalizumab (Tysabri) or dimethylfumarate (Tecfidera). Natalizumab, an immuno-modulatory medication, was associated with 563 cases of PML in MS patients worldwide as of June 2015.<ref name=pmid26150206/>\n\nKoralnik has written book chapters<ref name=Bennet/><ref name=Koralnik/> on JCV and PML and on the neurologic complications of HIV infection. He has been an invited speaker on those topics across the US, as well as in England, Israel, Italy, France, Switzerland, Zambia and Malaysia. He has also delivered lectures and continuing medical education courses at medical society meetings and medical conferences.\n\nIn addition, Koralnik has been active in expanding global health, which involves striving to achieve equity in the health of all people in the world. At the Global Neurology research program in Lusaka, Zambia, he and his colleagues have studied<ref name=pmid25740861/> central nervous system opportunistic infections and new onset seizures in HIV-infected patients. There are currently only four neurologists<ref name=\"RUSH U Zambia\"/> in all of Zambia, which has a population of 14.3 million. Starting in 2017,<ref name=\"RUSH U Zambia\"/> neuro-immunology fellows and selected neurology residents from RUMC will spend a month-long elective in Zambia.\n\n==Personal life==\nKoralnik is married and has three children.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199009273231303 |pmid=1975637 |title=A Controlled Study of Early Neurologic Abnormalities in Men with Asymptomatic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=323 |issue=13 |pages=864\u201370 |year=1990 |last1=Koralnik |first1=Igor J. |last2=Beaumanoir |first2=Anne |author-link2=Anne Beaumanoir|last3=H\u00e4usler |first3=Rudolf |last4=Kohler |first4=Andr\u00e9 |last5=Safran |first5=Avinoam B. |last6=Delacoux |first6=R\u00e9gine |last7=Vibert |first7=Dominique |last8=Mayer |first8=Eugene |last9=Burkhard |first9=Pierre |last10=Nahory |first10=Albert |last11=Magistris |first11=Michel R. |last12=Sanches |first12=Joao |last13=Myers |first13=Peter |last14=Paccolat |first14=Fabienne |last15=Quo\u00ebx |first15=Fran\u00e7ois |last16=Gabriel |first16=Victor |last17=Perrin |first17=Luc |last18=Mermillod |first18=B. |last19=Gauthier |first19=G\u00e9rard |last20=Waldvogel |first20=Francis A. |last21=Hirschel |first21=Bernard }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ectrims-bio>European Commission for Treatment and Research on Multiple Sclerosis.

Koralnik in front of the hospital tower at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.]]\n\n'''Igor Koralnik''' is an American physician, neurologist and scientist. He is one of the first physicians to study the neurologic complications caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]])<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\"/> and is a leading researcher<ref name=ectrims-bio/> in the investigation of the [[Polyomaviridae|polyomavirus]] JC (JC virus), which causes [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML), a disease of the central nervous system that occurs in immunosuppressed individuals. He worked as an acting fill-in anchor for the [[WGN-TV]] in Chicago.\n\n==Education and training==\nKoralnik was born in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] on July 20, 1962. He moved to the United States in 1990 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He received his medical degree at the [[University of Geneva]] Medical School, Switzerland, in 1987. While a medical student, he became interested in a new disease \u2013 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), whose origin in the HIV virus was discovered in 1983.\n\nKoralnik's doctoral dissertation focused on the early neurological complications of AIDS. He used magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography and other electrophysiologic diagnostic technology to track damage to the brain and nerve cells. He continued these studies during his internship and residency in Internal medicine at [[Geneva University Hospital]], under the mentorship of Dr. Bernard Hirschel. This work formed the basis of a 1990 article,<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\"/> which Koralnik lead-authored, in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], and it won him a 1991 award<ref name=rushu-bio/> from the Swiss Society of Internal Medicine.\n\nIn 1990, Koralnik came to the United States for a postdoctoral fellowship on molecular biology of retroviruses<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> at the laboratory of  [[Robert C. Gallo]], MD, a leading AIDS researcher, at the [[National Cancer Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. During three years at the Gallo laboratory, Koralnik performed molecular studies on the [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1|Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I]] (HTLV-I). Upon completion of the fellowship in 1993, he moved to Boston to enter the Harvard-Longwood residency program in neurology at [[Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital]]  and [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] (BIDMC).<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/>\n\nDuring his neurology residency, Koralnik began studying the polyomavirus JC, the agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), under the mentorship of Norman Letvin, MD,<ref name=\"Haynes & Permar 2012\"/> professor of medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]] and chief of the Division of Viral Pathogenesis at BIDMC. After graduating from the neurology residency in 1996, Koralnik had to retake an internship year in internal medicine, which he had already completed in Switzerland, to be eligible for board certification in neurology in the United States. He received his certificate in neurology from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1998.\n\n==Clinical career==\nIn 1997, Koralnik became assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. He founded and directed the HIV/Neurology Center at BIDMC,<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> which is an outpatient treatment center for patients with neurologic problems due to HIV infection. He also opened a research laboratory at BIDMC studying the pathogenesis of JC virus in PML.<ref name=ectrims-bio/>\n\nDuring 19 years in Boston, he was the director of the neuro-HIV fellowship program at BIDMC. He rose through the ranks and became a full professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in 2009 and chief of the Division of Neuro-Immunology at BIDMC in 2012.<ref name=ectrims-bio/> Koralnik became deeply engaged in mentoring young physicians and scientists at BIDMC and other Harvard-affiliated hospitals. Together with a BIDMC mentee, Dr. Omar Siddiqi, Koralnik founded<ref name=rushu-bio/> in 2010 the Global Neurology research program at the University Teaching Hospital in [[Lusaka, Zambia]].\n\nIn July 2016, he moved to Chicago to become chairperson of the Department of Neurological Sciences and the Jean Schweppe Armour professor of neurology and medicine at [[Rush University Medical Center]] (RUMC)<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> and created the Section of Neuro-infectious Diseases<ref name=\"Rush U Neuroinfectious Disease Services\"/> at RUMC.\n\nKoralnik developed a neuro-immunology fellowship at BIDMC<ref name=ectrims-bio/> and then one at RUMC.<ref name=\"Rush U Neuroimmunology Fellowship\"/> Fellows rotate in the [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) clinic, the neuro-HIV clinic and the neuro-infectious disease clinic at RUMC and learn to care for patients over the entire immunologic spectrum.\n\n==Memberships and editorial activities==\nKoralnik joined the American Neurological Association in 2004 and was elected member of the prestigious American Society for Clinical Investigation in 2008.<ref name=\"ASCI-bio\"/> He is a founding member of the Neuro-infectious Disease Section and Global Health Section of the American Academy of Neurology.<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> He has been a member of the International Society for NeuroVirology since its inception in 1998 and became its president in 2016.<ref name=\"ISNV Governance\"/>\n\nKoralnik is also a member of the American Neurological Association, the American Association of Immunologists, and of the American Society for Microbiology.<ref name=\"Rush U PR March 7, 2016\"/> He has been on the editorial board of the Journal of NeuroVirology since 2008<ref name=\"NeuroVirology Editorial Board\"/> and he was associate editor of the Annals of Neurology from 2013-2016.<ref name=\"Annals of Neurology Editoral Board\"/>\n\n==Major accomplishments==\nKoralnik started his career studying early neurological aspects of HIV/AIDS.<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\"/> Neurological complications occur in 30% to 50% of HIV-infected persons, and they can present as the initial symptom, throughout the course of the disease or in the advanced stage.<ref name=\"BIDMC HIV Neurology Center\"/>\n\nHe then focused his research on JC virus (JCV) and PML.<ref name=ectrims-bio/> Koralnik and colleagues have characterized the cellular immune response against JCV, and showed that it was a key aspect to survival in PML patients.<ref name=pmid15215217/><ref name=pmid19901246/> He is now studying the development of epilepsy, which occurs in 44% of patients with PML.<ref name=pmid26676826/>\n\nKoralnik is credited<ref name=pmid23092189/> for demonstrating that JCV can infect not only glial cells (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) but also neurons. He and his colleagues have identified two novel clinical entities distinct from PML \u2013 JCV-granule cell neuronopathy<ref name=pmid15786466/> and JCV-encephalopathy<ref name=pmid19557867/> \u2013 that are caused by JCV deletion variants. He and his colleagues also demonstrated<ref name=pmid24895208/> that JCV can infect meningeal and choroid plexus cells and cause JCV meningitis. They are studying the development of epilepsy in PML patients as well. Koralnik has also been studying the determinants of latency and reactivation of JCV in patients with MS who have been treated with natalizumab (Tysabri) or dimethylfumarate (Tecfidera). Natalizumab, an immuno-modulatory medication, was associated with 563 cases of PML in MS patients worldwide as of June 2015.<ref name=pmid26150206/>\n\nKoralnik has written book chapters<ref name=Bennet/><ref name=Koralnik/> on JCV and PML and on the neurologic complications of HIV infection. He has been an invited speaker on those topics across the US, as well as in England, Israel, Italy, France, Switzerland, Zambia and Malaysia. He has also delivered lectures and continuing medical education courses at medical society meetings and medical conferences.\n\nIn addition, Koralnik has been active in expanding global health, which involves striving to achieve equity in the health of all people in the world. At the Global Neurology research program in Lusaka, Zambia, he and his colleagues have studied<ref name=pmid25740861/> central nervous system opportunistic infections and new onset seizures in HIV-infected patients. There are currently only four neurologists<ref name=\"RUSH U Zambia\"/> in all of Zambia, which has a population of 14.3 million. Starting in 2017,<ref name=\"RUSH U Zambia\"/> neuro-immunology fellows and selected neurology residents from RUMC will spend a month-long elective in Zambia.\n\n==Personal life==\nKoralnik is married and has three children.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Koralnik  et al 1990\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199009273231303 |pmid=1975637 |title=A Controlled Study of Early Neurologic Abnormalities in Men with Asymptomatic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=323 |issue=13 |pages=864\u201370 |year=1990 |last1=Koralnik |first1=Igor J. |last2=Beaumanoir |first2=Anne |author-link2=Anne Beaumanoir|last3=H\u00e4usler |first3=Rudolf |last4=Kohler |first4=Andr\u00e9 |last5=Safran |first5=Avinoam B. |last6=Delacoux |first6=R\u00e9gine |last7=Vibert |first7=Dominique |last8=Mayer |first8=Eugene |last9=Burkhard |first9=Pierre |last10=Nahory |first10=Albert |last11=Magistris |first11=Michel R. |last12=Sanches |first12=Joao |last13=Myers |first13=Peter |last14=Paccolat |first14=Fabienne |last15=Quo\u00ebx |first15=Fran\u00e7ois |last16=Gabriel |first16=Victor |last17=Perrin |first17=Luc |last18=Mermillod |first18=B. |last19=Gauthier |first19=G\u00e9rard |last20=Waldvogel |first20=Francis A. |last21=Hirschel |first21=Bernard }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ectrims-bio>European Commission for Treatment and Research on Multiple Sclerosis.

Uttar Pradesh is one of the six states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the [[Vidhan Sabha]] (Legislative Assembly) and the [[Vidhan Parishad]] (Legislative Council). The Vidhan Parishad is a permanent House, consisting of 100 members.\n\n==History==\nThe Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad came into existence by the Government of India Act of 1935. The former and previous Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Anandiben Patel, was previously an elected member of it. The Legislative Council consisted of 60 members. The term of a member of the Council was nine years with one-third of its members retiring after every three years. The Houses enjoyed the right of electing their Presiding Officers known as the President. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was held on 29 July 1937. Sir Sitaram and Begum Aijaz Rasul were elected the President and the Vice-President of the Legislative Council respectively. Sir Sitaram was in office until 9 March 1949. Chandra Bhal became the next Chairman on 10 March 1949.\n\nAfter the independence and adoption of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] on 26 January 1950 Chandra Bhal was re-elected the Chairman of the Legislative Council and served until 5 May 1958. Sri Nizamuddin was elected the Deputy Chairman of the Council on 27 May 1952. He served until 1964.\n\n==Nominations and election==\nWhen, under the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Legislative Council came into existence in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], it comprised 60 members. On 26 January 1950, the total membership of the Vidhan Parishad (legislative council) of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state was increased from 60 to 72.  With the Constitution  (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956, the strength of the Council was enhanced to 108. After the reorganisation of Uttar Pradesh state in November 2000 and the creation of [[Uttarakhand]] state, this strength has now reduced to 100.\n\nThe present composition of the Vidhan Parishad is as follows: \n* 10 members are nominated by the governor of Uttar Pradesh.\n* 38 members are elected by the [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] members.\n* 36 members are elected by the Local bodies.\n* 8 members are elected by the teachers.\n* 8 members are elected by the graduates.\n\n==Term==\nMembers are now elected or nominated for six years and one-third of them retire on the expiration of every second year, so a member continues as such for six years. The vacant seats are filled up by fresh elections and nominations (by Governor) at the beginning of every third year. The retiring members are also eligible for re-election and re-nomination any number of times. The Presiding Officers of Vidhan Parishad are Chairman and Deputy Chairman. [[Ramesh Yadav]] is the current Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council.\n\n==Constituencies and members==\n''See here the [[List of members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council]]''\n\nThe following are the constituencies of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|title=The Delimitation of Council Constituencies (Uttar Pradesh) Order, 1951|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India|access-date=2009-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619084058/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|archive-date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Elected from Graduates Constituencies===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Uttar Pradesh is one of the six states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the [[Vidhan Sabha]] (Legislative Assembly) and the [[Vidhan Parishad]] (Legislative Council). The Vidhan Parishad is a permanent House, consisting of 100 members.\n\n==History==\nThe Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad came into existence by the Government of India Act of 1935. The former and previous Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Anandiben Patel, was previously an elected member of it. The Legislative Council consisted of 60 members. The term of a member of the Council was nine years with one-third of its members retiring after every three years. The Houses enjoyed the right of electing their Presiding Officers known as the President. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was held on 29 July 1937. Sir Sitaram and Begum Aijaz Rasul were elected the President and the Vice-President of the Legislative Council respectively. Sir Sitaram was in office until 9 March 1949. Chandra Bhal became the next Chairman on 10 March 1949.\n\nAfter the independence and adoption of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] on 26 January 1950 Chandra Bhal was re-elected the Chairman of the Legislative Council and served until 5 May 1958. Sri Nizamuddin was elected the Deputy Chairman of the Council on 27 May 1952. He served until 1964.\n\n==Nominations and election==\nWhen, under the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1935]], the Legislative Council came into existence in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], it comprised 60 members. On 26 January 1950, the total membership of the Vidhan Parishad (legislative council) of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state was increased from 60 to 72.  With the Constitution  (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956, the strength of the Council was enhanced to 108. After the reorganisation of Uttar Pradesh state in November 2000 and the creation of [[Uttarakhand]] state, this strength has now reduced to 100.\n\nThe present composition of the Vidhan Parishad is as follows: \n* 10 members are nominated by the governor of Uttar Pradesh.\n* 38 members are elected by the [[Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] members.\n* 36 members are elected by the Local bodies.\n* 8 members are elected by the teachers.\n* 8 members are elected by the graduates.\n\n==Term==\nMembers are now elected or nominated for six years and one-third of them retire on the expiration of every second year, so a member continues as such for six years. The vacant seats are filled up by fresh elections and nominations (by Governor) at the beginning of every third year. The retiring members are also eligible for re-election and re-nomination any number of times. The Presiding Officers of Vidhan Parishad are Chairman and Deputy Chairman. [[Ramesh Yadav]] is the current Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council.\n\n==Constituencies and members==\n''See here the [[List of members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council]]''\n\nThe following are the constituencies of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|title=The Delimitation of Council Constituencies (Uttar Pradesh) Order, 1951|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India|access-date=2009-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619084058/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/delup.htm|archive-date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Elected from Graduates Constituencies===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

On 20 October the 2nd Dublins took part in the first major battle of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]]. The Boers had appeared on Talana Hill in the early morning and after they launched a few shells at Dundee, the garrison responded and attacked the hill. The 2nd Dublins took part in the attack and, after some fierce fighting, removed the Boers. They suffered heavy casualties in the process, losing, amongst others, Captain George Anderson Weldon, the first officer of the Dublins to be killed in the war. The British had to abandon Dundee soon afterwards, withdrawing to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]]. The Boers besieged the town in late October. On 30 October the garrison's commander, Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] VC, ordered an attack on [[Battle of Ladysmith#Lombard's Kop|Lombard's Kop]] which the Dublin Fusiliers took part in.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 22-28</ref>\n\nOn 15 November 1899, a detachment of Dubliners and the [[Durban Light Infantry]] were garrisoning an [[armoured train]] operating from [[Estcourt]] with the objective of monitoring Boer movements. The Boers ambushed them on their return and a section of the train was de-railed in the chaos. Among the passengers was [[Winston Churchill]], then a war correspondent accompanying the detachment, who helped load the train engine with wounded before it made an escape attempt, pushing through the de-railed section that blocked its path and making it through safely. The remaining troops put up a stout defence until they were eventually compelled to surrender, including Churchill who had returned to the remaining defenders. Churchill later made a successful escape attempt from his prison in [[Pretoria]]. He wrote glowingly of the gallantry displayed by the Dublin Fusiliers and the other troops that were present during the ambush. The Dublins lost three men during the ambush.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talana Hill Memorial|url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=646048|publisher=The Genealogical Society of South Africa|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the [[Siege of Ladysmith]], which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900. On 15 December the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Colenso]]. The Dublins were part of the 5th Brigade (known as the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|Irish Brigade]]) who crossed the wrong part of the [[Tugela River]] and suffered heavy casualties in the process. The battle was a defeat for the British forces and became part of a notorious period for the British in the war, known as \"[[Black Week]]\". The defeat, however, did not discourage further attempts being made. The Dublins did not participate in any more attempts until January 1900 when they took part in the Tugela campaign, collectively known as the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]]. February saw the Dublins take part in heavy fighting before, on 27 February, they supported the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] in their final charge on Pieters Hill, suffering heavy casualties though taking the position. This victory led to the siege of Ladysmith being lifted the following day by cavalry, with the main force of infantry arriving on 3 March. On 10 March 1900 [[Queen Victoria]] decreed that a sprig of [[shamrock]] be adorned on the headdress of Irish units on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] to commemorate their actions in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Royal Irish|url=https://www.royal-irish.com/events/saint-patrick%E2%80%99s-day-and-the-sprig-of-shamrock|title=Saint Patrick\u2019s Day and the Sprig of Shamrock|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> This tradition remains in existence with Irish units of the British Army.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Irish Guards in Kenya  |author= Amanda Dellor  |author2= Faye Harland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8580000/8580437.stm  |publisher=[[BBC]]  |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn May, the British began their advance towards the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], one of the Boer republics, and early the following month the Dublins took part in the effort against [[Battle of Laing's Nek|Laing's Nek]] during the attempt to achieve an entry into the Transvaal. This was successfully achieved and the capital, [[Pretoria]], was captured on 5 June. The war, however, did not end and the Boers began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the British. During this phase of the war, many [[blockhouse]]s were constructed to help restrict the movement of the Boer guerrillas and men of the Dublin Fusiliers helped to garrison them. This phase of the war also saw the [[mounted infantry]] companies, among which were Dublin Fusiliers MI, in their element, hunting the (now small) groups of Boers. The Dublin Fusiliers also took part in the hunt for [[Christiaan de Wet]], a prominent Boer officer.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 121-141</ref>\n\nThe last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902, the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] formally ending the conflict. During the war, volunteers from the three [[militia]] battalions of the Dublins had been used to provide reinforcements for the two regular battalions fighting in South Africa. The 2nd Dublins had left South Africa in January 1902. The Dublins suffered nearly 700 casualties (killed, wounded, missing) during the conflict, many of whom died of disease, indeed the vast majority of British Army casualties were from disease.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe 4th ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) battalion, formed from the Royal Dublin City Militia in 1881, was one of the reserve battalions. It was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in December the same year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War.

The 2nd Dublins took part in the retreat following the [[Battle of Mons]], taking part in their first engagement on 26 August 1914 at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]<ref name=igws/> that helped delay the German advance towards [[Paris]], inflicting such heavy casualties that the Germans thought they faced more machine-guns than they actually did. The BEF then resumed their retreat, but many men, including from the Dublin Fusiliers, were stranded behind German lines, and many were taken prisoner by the Germans. The Battalion, badly depleted, later took part in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] (5\u20139 September) that finally halted the German advance just on the outskirts of Paris, forcing the Germans to retreat to the [[Aisne]].<ref name=igws/> There, the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] and later took part in their last major engagement of the war, at the [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Battle of Messines]], which began on 12 October and ended on 2 November.<ref name=igws/>\n\nThe 2nd Dublins took part in all but one of the subsidiary battles during [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]] that took place between 22 April&nbsp;\u2013 24 May 1915.

They had no respite, taking part in the next two subsidiary battles at [[Battle of Frezenberg|Frezenberg]] and [[Battle of Bellewaarde|Bellewaarde]].<ref name=igws/> On 24 May the Battalion was subject to a German [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] attack near [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of St Julien (24 April \u2013 5 May)|Saint-Julien]] and effectively disintegrated as a fighting unit.<ref name=igws/> The British at that time had no defences against gas attack; indeed the large-scale use of gas by the Germans on the Western Front had begun at Second Ypres. The 2nd Dublins' commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Loveband of [[Naas]], died the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everymanremembered.org/profiles/soldier/1619386/|title=Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Loveband|publisher=Every man remembered|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> The Battalion did not take part in any more major battles for the rest of the year.<ref name=igws/>\n\n[[File:The Official Visits To the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q6153.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal Francis Bourne, the Head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, and Major-General William Hickie, the Commander of the 16th Irish Division, inspecting troops of the 8/9th Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers (48th Brigade, 16th Division) at Ervillers, 27 October 1917 (IWM Q6153)]]\n\nThe 8th and 9th Dublins, who had arrived in France in December 1915 as part of the [[48th Brigade (United Kingdom)|48th Brigade]] in the [[16th (Irish) Division]],<ref name=trail/> were also subject to a German gas attack at the [[Gas attacks at Hulluch|Battle of Hulluch]], near [[Loos, Nord|Loos]], on 27 April 1916, suffering heavy casualties.<ref name=igws/> There had been trouble at home that month in Dublin when the [[Easter Rising]] had taken place though, in spite of this, the Dublin Fusiliers still performed with dedication to their duty. The British launched the Somme offensive on 1 July and the 1st and 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First day on the Somme]] that saw the British forces sustain horrific casualties, some 60,000, about 20,000 of which were killed. The 8th and 9th Dublins took part in their first major battle during the Somme Offensive, taking part in the capture of [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]] on 9 September, in which Lieutenant [[Tom Kettle]] fell in action.<ref name=igws/> The Dublins also took part in the last major battle of the offensive, at the [[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre]] that took place between 13\u201318 November. The Dublins, once again, had suffered large numbers of casualties during the Somme offensive.<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn March 1917 the Germans retreated to the [[Hindenburg Line]] which was a formidable series of defences that the Germans had constructed. In April the British launched the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] and the Dublin Fusiliers took part in the two battles of the Scarpe that took place in April. The 10th Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Arleux]] (28\u201329 April) that saw the Dublins last involvement in a major battle of the Arras offensive. Half of the [[French Army]], exhausted and angry at the enormous losses it had sustained, mutinied, refusing to fight unless it was to defend against German attacks. This compelled the British Army to take the leading role, and this would see the Dublin Fusiliers take part in further offensives before the year ended. In June, the Dublins took part in the capture of [[Heuvelland|Wytschaete]] during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. The Regiment's battalions subsequently took part in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July&nbsp;\u201310 November), being involved in several of its subsidiary battles, including at [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Langemarck]]. As during Second Ypres, the Regiment suffered heavily, indeed the 9th Dublins had sustained such losses that they effectively ceased to be a fighting unit, and were amalgamated with the 8th Dublins in October, forming the 8th/9th Dublins. The Regiment's last major action of 1917 was a diversionary attack during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (28 November&nbsp;\u2013 3 December).<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn February 1918, due to the heavy losses that had been sustained, the 8th/9th and 10th Dublins were disbanded and its men were transferred to the 1st and 2nd Dublins. On 21 March the Regiment was on the defensive during the [[Operation Michael#Battle of St. Quentin (21\u201323 March 1918)|Battle of St. Quentin]] when the Germans began an immense bombardment as part of their last-gasp major offensive known as [[Operation Michael]] against British and [[Allies of World War I|Empire]] forces in the [[Picardy]] area. The 1st and 2nd Dublins suffered heavily from the intense bombardment (which included poison gas) and when the Germans attacked shortly afterwards, the Germans broke through the shattered remnants. The Germans made significant gains but their offensive gradually lost momentum and the Germans were pushed back by April. During that month, on 14 April, the 1st and 2nd Dublins had to briefly amalgamate due to the losses it had sustained during the German offensive, forming the 1st/2nd Dublins. The 1st Battalion was reconstituted a few days later with drafts from the 2nd Battalion, which was reduced to [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] strength.<ref name=trail/> On 26 April the 1st Dublins left the 16th (Irish) and rejoined the 86th Brigade, 29th Division. In June the 2nd Dublins transferred to the [[31st Division (United Kingdom)|31st Division]] and was reconstituted.<ref name=trail/> It was transferred to the Lines of Communication (LoC) before moving to [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th Division]] in July. In August the Allies launched their counter-offensive against the Germans and eventually reached the Hindenburg Line. The Allies launched their offensive against the Line in September, and the 1st, 2nd, and 7th Dublins, took part in the battles of the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|St Quentin Canal]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]] and [[Battle of Beaurevoir|Beaurevoir]], and the Hindenburg Line was successfully breached by the Allies. The Dublins took part in the last offensives of the war, taking part in, among others, the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Fourth Battle of Ypres]], [[Battle of Courtrai (1918)|Battle of Courtrai]] and the [[Battle of the Selle]] during September and October.

It was an effort to support [[Russia]] by keeping the [[Dardanelles|Dardanelles Strait]] open. The 1st Dublins, as part of [[86th Brigade (United Kingdom)|86th Brigade]] of the [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]], landed at V Beach, [[Landing at Cape Helles|Cape Helles]] on 25 April.<ref name=trail/> The 1st Dublins were the first to land, landing via boats that were either towed or rowed, and suffered heavy casualties from a withering hail of machine-gun fire from the Turkish defenders, most not even getting out of their boats, while others drowned in the attempt, most due to the equipment they carried. The [[Royal Munster Fusiliers|1st Royal Munsters]], two companies of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|2nd Royal Hampshires]] and a company of the 1st Dublins, landed from the [[SS River Clyde|SS ''River Clyde'']] soon afterwards and were also decimated by machine-gun fire.<ref>Steel and Hart, pp. 90\u201396</ref> In spite of the severe casualties, the British forces managed to land large numbers of troops by nightfall.

On 7 June the division left the UK under the command of Irish General [[Bryan Mahon]], arriving in [[Lemnos]] by late July in preparation for the landings at [[Suvla Bay]], Gallipoli. The Dublins landed at Suvla on 7 August; a day after the first landings there had taken place. Unlike at V Beach at Helles, Suvla was barely defended but incompetence at the higher echelons of command led to the British troops not exploiting their early advantage, ensuring that the Suvla landings became static and allowing the Turks to reinforce their defences. The Dublins took part in the effort to capture a position known as Chocolate Hill (7\u20138 August),<ref name=igws/> which was successfully taken, though at a heavy cost. On 9 August the Dublins took part in the attempt to recapture [[Battle of Scimitar Hill|Scimitar Hill]],<ref name=igws/> and managed to gain some ground but experienced ferocious resistance from the Turks that eventually forced the British to withdraw. The 1st Dublins and the rest of the 29th Division were moved to Suvla to reinforce the British force there. On 21 August the Dublins took part in another attempt to take Scimitar Hill and after the battle, the Suvla front-line became static, with no more major attacks being attempted. In September, the 6th and 7th Dublins and the rest of their division left Suvla, arriving in [[Mudros]] on [[Lemnos]] later that month.<ref name=trail/>\n\nOn 1 January 1916, the 1st Dublins left Gallipoli for Egypt with the rest of the 29th Division and the last remaining British troops left Gallipoli on 9 January.<ref name=trail/> The ironic thing was that the evacuation of Gallipoli by the Allies was, arguably, the most successful part of the campaign.

On 20 October the 2nd Dublins took part in the first major battle of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]]. The Boers had appeared on Talana Hill in the early morning and after they launched a few shells at Dundee, the garrison responded and attacked the hill. The 2nd Dublins took part in the attack and, after some fierce fighting, removed the Boers. They suffered heavy casualties in the process, losing, amongst others, Captain George Anderson Weldon, the first officer of the Dublins to be killed in the war. The British had to abandon Dundee soon afterwards, withdrawing to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]]. The Boers besieged the town in late October. On 30 October the garrison's commander, Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] VC, ordered an attack on [[Battle of Ladysmith#Lombard's Kop|Lombard's Kop]] which the Dublin Fusiliers took part in.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 22-28</ref>\n\nOn 15 November 1899, a detachment of Dubliners and the [[Durban Light Infantry]] were garrisoning an [[armoured train]] operating from [[Estcourt]] with the objective of monitoring Boer movements. The Boers ambushed them on their return and a section of the train was de-railed in the chaos. Among the passengers was [[Winston Churchill]], then a war correspondent accompanying the detachment, who helped load the train engine with wounded before it made an escape attempt, pushing through the de-railed section that blocked its path and making it through safely. The remaining troops put up a stout defence until they were eventually compelled to surrender, including Churchill who had returned to the remaining defenders. Churchill later made a successful escape attempt from his prison in [[Pretoria]]. He wrote glowingly of the gallantry displayed by the Dublin Fusiliers and the other troops that were present during the ambush. The Dublins lost three men during the ambush.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talana Hill Memorial|url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=646048|publisher=The Genealogical Society of South Africa|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the [[Siege of Ladysmith]], which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900. On 15 December the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Colenso]]. The Dublins were part of the 5th Brigade (known as the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|Irish Brigade]]) who crossed the wrong part of the [[Tugela River]] and suffered heavy casualties in the process. The battle was a defeat for the British forces and became part of a notorious period for the British in the war, known as \"[[Black Week]]\". The defeat, however, did not discourage further attempts being made. The Dublins did not participate in any more attempts until January 1900 when they took part in the Tugela campaign, collectively known as the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]]. February saw the Dublins take part in heavy fighting before, on 27 February, they supported the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] in their final charge on Pieters Hill, suffering heavy casualties though taking the position. This victory led to the siege of Ladysmith being lifted the following day by cavalry, with the main force of infantry arriving on 3 March. On 10 March 1900 [[Queen Victoria]] decreed that a sprig of [[shamrock]] be adorned on the headdress of Irish units on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] to commemorate their actions in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Royal Irish|url=https://www.royal-irish.com/events/saint-patrick%E2%80%99s-day-and-the-sprig-of-shamrock|title=Saint Patrick\u2019s Day and the Sprig of Shamrock|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> This tradition remains in existence with Irish units of the British Army.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Irish Guards in Kenya  |author= Amanda Dellor  |author2= Faye Harland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8580000/8580437.stm  |publisher=[[BBC]]  |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn May, the British began their advance towards the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], one of the Boer republics, and early the following month the Dublins took part in the effort against [[Battle of Laing's Nek|Laing's Nek]] during the attempt to achieve an entry into the Transvaal. This was successfully achieved and the capital, [[Pretoria]], was captured on 5 June. The war, however, did not end and the Boers began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the British. During this phase of the war, many [[blockhouse]]s were constructed to help restrict the movement of the Boer guerrillas and men of the Dublin Fusiliers helped to garrison them. This phase of the war also saw the [[mounted infantry]] companies, among which were Dublin Fusiliers MI, in their element, hunting the (now small) groups of Boers. The Dublin Fusiliers also took part in the hunt for [[Christiaan de Wet]], a prominent Boer officer.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 121-141</ref>\n\nThe last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902, the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] formally ending the conflict. During the war, volunteers from the three [[militia]] battalions of the Dublins had been used to provide reinforcements for the two regular battalions fighting in South Africa. The 2nd Dublins had left South Africa in January 1902. The Dublins suffered nearly 700 casualties (killed, wounded, missing) during the conflict, many of whom died of disease, indeed the vast majority of British Army casualties were from disease.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe 4th ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) battalion, formed from the Royal Dublin City Militia in 1881, was one of the reserve battalions. It was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in December the same year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War.

The 2nd Dublins took part in the retreat following the [[Battle of Mons]], taking part in their first engagement on 26 August 1914 at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]<ref name=igws/> that helped delay the German advance towards [[Paris]], inflicting such heavy casualties that the Germans thought they faced more machine-guns than they actually did. The BEF then resumed their retreat, but many men, including from the Dublin Fusiliers, were stranded behind German lines, and many were taken prisoner by the Germans. The Battalion, badly depleted, later took part in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] (5\u20139 September) that finally halted the German advance just on the outskirts of Paris, forcing the Germans to retreat to the [[Aisne]].<ref name=igws/> There, the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] and later took part in their last major engagement of the war, at the [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Battle of Messines]], which began on 12 October and ended on 2 November.<ref name=igws/>\n\nThe 2nd Dublins took part in all but one of the subsidiary battles during [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]] that took place between 22 April&nbsp;\u2013 24 May 1915.

They had no respite, taking part in the next two subsidiary battles at [[Battle of Frezenberg|Frezenberg]] and [[Battle of Bellewaarde|Bellewaarde]].<ref name=igws/> On 24 May the Battalion was subject to a German [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] attack near [[Second Battle of Ypres#Battle of St Julien (24 April \u2013 5 May)|Saint-Julien]] and effectively disintegrated as a fighting unit.<ref name=igws/> The British at that time had no defences against gas attack; indeed the large-scale use of gas by the Germans on the Western Front had begun at Second Ypres. The 2nd Dublins' commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Loveband of [[Naas]], died the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everymanremembered.org/profiles/soldier/1619386/|title=Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Loveband|publisher=Every man remembered|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> The Battalion did not take part in any more major battles for the rest of the year.<ref name=igws/>\n\n[[File:The Official Visits To the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q6153.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal Francis Bourne, the Head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, and Major-General William Hickie, the Commander of the 16th Irish Division, inspecting troops of the 8/9th Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers (48th Brigade, 16th Division) at Ervillers, 27 October 1917 (IWM Q6153)]]\n\nThe 8th and 9th Dublins, who had arrived in France in December 1915 as part of the [[48th Brigade (United Kingdom)|48th Brigade]] in the [[16th (Irish) Division]],<ref name=trail/> were also subject to a German gas attack at the [[Gas attacks at Hulluch|Battle of Hulluch]], near [[Loos, Nord|Loos]], on 27 April 1916, suffering heavy casualties.<ref name=igws/> There had been trouble at home that month in Dublin when the [[Easter Rising]] had taken place though, in spite of this, the Dublin Fusiliers still performed with dedication to their duty. The British launched the Somme offensive on 1 July and the 1st and 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First day on the Somme]] that saw the British forces sustain horrific casualties, some 60,000, about 20,000 of which were killed. The 8th and 9th Dublins took part in their first major battle during the Somme Offensive, taking part in the capture of [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]] on 9 September, in which Lieutenant [[Tom Kettle]] fell in action.<ref name=igws/> The Dublins also took part in the last major battle of the offensive, at the [[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre]] that took place between 13\u201318 November. The Dublins, once again, had suffered large numbers of casualties during the Somme offensive.<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn March 1917 the Germans retreated to the [[Hindenburg Line]] which was a formidable series of defences that the Germans had constructed. In April the British launched the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] and the Dublin Fusiliers took part in the two battles of the Scarpe that took place in April. The 10th Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Arleux]] (28\u201329 April) that saw the Dublins last involvement in a major battle of the Arras offensive. Half of the [[French Army]], exhausted and angry at the enormous losses it had sustained, mutinied, refusing to fight unless it was to defend against German attacks. This compelled the British Army to take the leading role, and this would see the Dublin Fusiliers take part in further offensives before the year ended. In June, the Dublins took part in the capture of [[Heuvelland|Wytschaete]] during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. The Regiment's battalions subsequently took part in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July&nbsp;\u201310 November), being involved in several of its subsidiary battles, including at [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Langemarck]]. As during Second Ypres, the Regiment suffered heavily, indeed the 9th Dublins had sustained such losses that they effectively ceased to be a fighting unit, and were amalgamated with the 8th Dublins in October, forming the 8th/9th Dublins. The Regiment's last major action of 1917 was a diversionary attack during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (28 November&nbsp;\u2013 3 December).<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn February 1918, due to the heavy losses that had been sustained, the 8th/9th and 10th Dublins were disbanded and its men were transferred to the 1st and 2nd Dublins. On 21 March the Regiment was on the defensive during the [[Operation Michael#Battle of St. Quentin (21\u201323 March 1918)|Battle of St. Quentin]] when the Germans began an immense bombardment as part of their last-gasp major offensive known as [[Operation Michael]] against British and [[Allies of World War I|Empire]] forces in the [[Picardy]] area. The 1st and 2nd Dublins suffered heavily from the intense bombardment (which included poison gas) and when the Germans attacked shortly afterwards, the Germans broke through the shattered remnants. The Germans made significant gains but their offensive gradually lost momentum and the Germans were pushed back by April. During that month, on 14 April, the 1st and 2nd Dublins had to briefly amalgamate due to the losses it had sustained during the German offensive, forming the 1st/2nd Dublins. The 1st Battalion was reconstituted a few days later with drafts from the 2nd Battalion, which was reduced to [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] strength.<ref name=trail/> On 26 April the 1st Dublins left the 16th (Irish) and rejoined the 86th Brigade, 29th Division. In June the 2nd Dublins transferred to the [[31st Division (United Kingdom)|31st Division]] and was reconstituted.<ref name=trail/> It was transferred to the Lines of Communication (LoC) before moving to [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th Division]] in July. In August the Allies launched their counter-offensive against the Germans and eventually reached the Hindenburg Line. The Allies launched their offensive against the Line in September, and the 1st, 2nd, and 7th Dublins, took part in the battles of the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|St Quentin Canal]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]] and [[Battle of Beaurevoir|Beaurevoir]], and the Hindenburg Line was successfully breached by the Allies. The Dublins took part in the last offensives of the war, taking part in, among others, the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Fourth Battle of Ypres]], [[Battle of Courtrai (1918)|Battle of Courtrai]] and the [[Battle of the Selle]] during September and October.

It was an effort to support [[Russia]] by keeping the [[Dardanelles|Dardanelles Strait]] open. The 1st Dublins, as part of [[86th Brigade (United Kingdom)|86th Brigade]] of the [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]], landed at V Beach, [[Landing at Cape Helles|Cape Helles]] on 25 April.<ref name=trail/> The 1st Dublins were the first to land, landing via boats that were either towed or rowed, and suffered heavy casualties from a withering hail of machine-gun fire from the Turkish defenders, most not even getting out of their boats, while others drowned in the attempt, most due to the equipment they carried. The [[Royal Munster Fusiliers|1st Royal Munsters]], two companies of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|2nd Royal Hampshires]] and a company of the 1st Dublins, landed from the [[SS River Clyde|SS ''River Clyde'']] soon afterwards and were also decimated by machine-gun fire.<ref>Steel and Hart, pp. 90\u201396</ref> In spite of the severe casualties, the British forces managed to land large numbers of troops by nightfall.

On 7 June the division left the UK under the command of Irish General [[Bryan Mahon]], arriving in [[Lemnos]] by late July in preparation for the landings at [[Suvla Bay]], Gallipoli. The Dublins landed at Suvla on 7 August; a day after the first landings there had taken place. Unlike at V Beach at Helles, Suvla was barely defended but incompetence at the higher echelons of command led to the British troops not exploiting their early advantage, ensuring that the Suvla landings became static and allowing the Turks to reinforce their defences. The Dublins took part in the effort to capture a position known as Chocolate Hill (7\u20138 August),<ref name=igws/> which was successfully taken, though at a heavy cost. On 9 August the Dublins took part in the attempt to recapture [[Battle of Scimitar Hill|Scimitar Hill]],<ref name=igws/> and managed to gain some ground but experienced ferocious resistance from the Turks that eventually forced the British to withdraw. The 1st Dublins and the rest of the 29th Division were moved to Suvla to reinforce the British force there. On 21 August the Dublins took part in another attempt to take Scimitar Hill and after the battle, the Suvla front-line became static, with no more major attacks being attempted. In September, the 6th and 7th Dublins and the rest of their division left Suvla, arriving in [[Mudros]] on [[Lemnos]] later that month.<ref name=trail/>\n\nOn 1 January 1916, the 1st Dublins left Gallipoli for Egypt with the rest of the 29th Division and the last remaining British troops left Gallipoli on 9 January.<ref name=trail/> The ironic thing was that the evacuation of Gallipoli by the Allies was, arguably, the most successful part of the campaign.

Three soldiers were killed outright, while a further four died later from their wounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishmedals.org/gpage43.html |title=Irish Medals |accessdate=29 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810083111/http://irishmedals.org/gpage43.html |archivedate=10 August 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B9743.jpg|thumb|Men of the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment, part of the [[231st Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Brigade]] of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Division]], crossing the Seine at Vernon, 28 August 1944.]]\nIn the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Hampshire Regiment had six battalions that fought abroad (the 1st, 2nd, 1/4th, 2/4th, 5th and 7th), whilst more battalions stayed at home. By the end of the Second World War, 2,094 officers and men of the Hampshire Regiment had lost their lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1rhamps.com/hampshireR/hamps.html|title=1st and 2nd Battalions The Hampshire Regiment|work=1rhamps.com|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n====The 1st Battalion====\nThe 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment was a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] unit that was deployed on Garrison duties in El Daba, Egypt at the beginning of the war.<ref name=scott46>Scott Daniell, p. 46</ref> It moved to Palestine on peace keeping duties in December 1939 and then moved to Moascar in Egypt, then to Mearsa Matruh in Summer 1940. One of its duties was to look after the large number of Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] after the fall of Sidi Barrani.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 50</ref>\n\nIn February 1941, the 1st Battalion arrived in [[Malta]], where it became part of the 1st (Malta) Infantry Brigade (with 1st [[Dorset Regiment]] and 2nd [[Devonshire Regiment]]). This later became the [[231st Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Infantry Brigade]]. Duties in Malta included airfield repair and working as stevedores in the docks. Malta was subjected to a [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|prolonged siege]] and, by July 1942, the food situation had become serious, but the situation eased as the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' fortunes improved in the [[North African Campaign]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 55</ref>\n\nIn April 1943, the 231st Brigade, including the 1st Hampshires, was moved to Alexandria, then subsequently to Cairo and Suez, where it trained as an [[Brigade group|independent assault brigade]]. Then, in July 1943, the 1st Battalion invaded [[Sicily]] as part of the first wave of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The beach landing went smoothly, but the 1st Battalion ran into resistance at [[Vizzini]] on 13 July when it ran into the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Herman Goring Parachute Panzer Division]]. On 22 July, the 1st Battalion was engaged in hard fighting for Agria, which only fell on 29 July. The 1st Battalion was reduced to three companies after the battle. There was further hard fighting to capture the Regalbuto Ridge, which ended the Sicilian Campaign. The 1st Battalion suffered 18 Officers and 286 Other Ranks killed or wounded in action in Sicily.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 128</ref>\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the 231st Brigade [[Allied invasion of Italy|landed in Italy]], coming ashore at Potro San Venere near Pizzo. The 1st Battalion was involved in fighting as the Germans withdrew northwards. By October 1943, the 1st Battalion was back in Sicily waiting for transport back to the United Kingdom and, by November, the battalion was back in the United Kingdom for the first time in 22 years.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe battalion was allocated to the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], one of the assault divisions for the [[Invasion of Normandy|invasion of North West Europe]], which had an excellent reputation after fighting in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]]. On 6 June 1944, the 1st Battalion came ashore as part of [[Operation Overlord]] without any supporting tanks. Despite facing machine gun fire, the men captured Le Hamel and Arromanches after a hard fight. By the end of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] , the 1st Battalion had suffered 182 casualties, 64 of them being killed in action.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 219</ref>\n\nThe Battalion started a three-week fight for the village of Hottot, against the German [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]], in June 1944. This culminated in a major assault on 11 July. The 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line the next day, testimony to the hard fighting. The Battalion was in the vanguard of the assault towards Villiers Bocage later in the month. There were stiff fights at St Germain d\u2019Ectot and Launay. Villiers Bocage was taken on 4 August, following which the 50th Division was taken out of the line.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 228</ref>\nIn August 1944, a brigade attack was launched towards Conde, and the Battalion attacked St Pierre la Vielle. The fighting was particularly hard and, after the 11-hour battle, three of its [[Rifle company|Rifle companies]] were severely reduced \u2013 \u2018B\u2019 Company had 25 men, \u2018C\u2019 Company had 35 men, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was down to just 12 men; as \u2018A\u2019 Company was only lightly engaged, it was not so depleted. On 12 August, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line. The Battalion was [[Motorized infantry|motorised]] and joined with the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] for the breakout attack later in the month. There was no fighting and, on 31 August, the 1st Battalion crossed the river Seine at Vernon and swept on to Amiens.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was then placed under command of the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and swept into Brussels on 3 September. The Battalion, still under command of the Guards Armoured, then started the attack towards Eindhoven, which was the attack designed to relieve the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|Polish]] [[Airborne forces|airborne troops]] [[Battle of Arnhem|fighting at Arnhem]], who had dropped as part of [[Operation Market Garden]], which ended in a failure. The Battalion, as part of 231st Infantry Brigade, was charged with defending the \"Corridor\" formed by the armoured advance. In October, the 1st Battalion moved up to Nijmegen and moved onto \"The Island\", the bridgehead over the river Waal but behind the river Lek.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 242</ref>\n\nIn October 1944, the Battalion attacked north of Bemmel, and expanded the bridgehead up to the Wettering Canal. The Battalion then went onto the defensive until the end of November. The Battalion then moved back to Ypres in Belgium, and subsequently was moved back to the United Kingdom with the rest of the 50th Division, and the men were mainly used as replacements for other infantry battalions, with the exception of a small training [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] consisting of 12 officers and 100 other ranks. The battalion ended the war in Louth, Lincolnshire.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 244</ref> Since D-Day, the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment had suffered over 1,281 casualties, including 231 officers and men killed in action, the rest being either wounded or missing in action.<ref>Monty's Northern Legions: 50th Northumbrian and 15th Scottish Divisions at War 1939-1945: Patrick Delaforce</ref>\n\n====The 2nd Battalion====\nThe 2nd Battalion was also a [[Regular army|Regular Army]] battalion and started the war in Aldershot, Hampshire, England.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 59</ref> In September 1939, the 2nd Battalion moved to Cherbourg, France with the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]], alongside the 3rd Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]] and the 2nd Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]], attached to [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]]. It then moved to Sille-le-Guillaume, and from there 250 miles north to take its allocated place on the \"Gort Line\", which it reached on 3 October. Later that month, the Battalion moved to the Belgian/French border and, in February 1940, the Battalion spent three weeks on the Maginot Line before returning to Metz.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 61</ref>\n\nThe Battalion crossed into Belgium in response to the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]] and, by 14 May, was digging into a defensive position. While an attack never came, with the retreat of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch]] and the [[Ninth Army (France)|French Ninth Army]], the 1st Division was ordered to retreat on 16 May. A slow retreat then commenced, ending at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. The Battalion began to be embarked from Dunkirk for the United Kingdom (some were evacuated on 2 June). The battalion managed to carry away 100% of their small-arms, mortars and anti-tank rifles. It was congratulated by the Minister for War, Mr [[Anthony Eden]]. The battalion then spent two years on home defence, training and preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] that never arrived.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, the Battalion, Hampshire Regiment sailed for [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], taking part in [[Operation Torch]] with the 1st Guards Brigade, which was now part of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Division]]. They disembarked at Algiers on 21 November and joined the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]]. Later that month, the Battalion moved to Tebourba.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 89</ref> The following day the 2nd Battalion were attacked by heavy shelling and, on 1 December, the Battalion was attacked by a force four times its size, which was able to outflank it and rake it with enfilading fire. This was the start of three days of fierce close combat, fought at close quarters and featuring bayonet charges and counter-charges. The battalion was forced back a mile and a half and, on 3 December, [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Wallace Le Patourel]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his gallantry in leading counter-attacks against the enemy. After three days, the Battalion retreated through Tebourba, only to find all other troops had been withdrawn and the road behind them was cut. The battalion broke into small groups and attempted to break through to allied lines, reuniting at Medjez-el-Bab; many, including the [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], were captured. The Battalion, which had started the battle with 689 men, was down to 194 men. The battalion was withdrawn from the line and in December, nine officers and 260 other ranks joined the 2nd Battalion.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 99</ref> After the fall of Tunis on 13 May 1943, the 2nd Battalion joined the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] attached to [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th (West Riding) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 118</ref>\n\n====The 128th Infantry Brigade====\nThe Hampshire Regiment had a number of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) battalions, whose ranks were swelled throughout 1939 when the TA was ordered to be doubled in size. During 1939, due to the number of new recruits, the 5/7th Battalion was split into the 5th Battalion and the 7th Battalion, and the 4th Battalion was split into the 1/4th Battalion and the 2/4th Battalion. The 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th Battalions were all grouped into the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th Infantry Brigade]] (the \"Hampshire Brigade\") and the 7th Battalion was part of the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]]. Both brigades were part of the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 75</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H16713.jpg|thumb|left|Men of the 2/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment scale an obstacle during 'toughening up' training in wintry conditions at [[Wateringbury]] in [[Kent]], 20 January 1942.]]\n\nHowever, on 6 June 1942, the 128th Brigade was detached from the 43rd Division until 15 August, when it was transferred to the [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Division]], where it would remain for the rest of the war. In January 1943, the brigade left Britain with the rest of the 46th Infantry Division, for North Africa, as part of [[Operation Torch]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 76</ref> The brigade disembarked at Algiers on 17 January, moving to Bone, where it remained until the end of January, when the brigade moved to Hunts Gap.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 102</ref>\n\n{{Further|Operation Ochsenkopf}}\n\nThe 5th Battalion was sent 12 miles further ahead to Sidi Nsir. The 5th Battalion at Sidi N'sir was attacked in overwhelming strength in February 1943 as the Germans began Operation \"Ox Head\", a Corps level assault by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|German Paratroopers]], elements of [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] and the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion. The 5th Battalion was supported by 155th Battery, [[Royal Artillery]]. The Germans had to take the Hampshires' hilltop positions before they could attack the artillery, knocking out all the guns, whose crews stood and died firing over open sights at the German tanks. Only nine gunners survived. At 5pm, \u2018B\u2019 Company of the 5th Battalion, reduced to 30 men, was overrun. At dusk, the battalion considered its position untenable, and it withdrew to a feature known as \"Hampshire Farm\". Of the four [[Company (military unit)|Rifle Companies]], only \u2018C\u2019 Company, less a single [[platoon]], and 30 men of \u2018D\u2019 Company, remained. The German force was delayed for one critical day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 107</ref>\n\nLater in the month, the Hampshire Brigade was attacked at Hunt's Gap by the German force that had been delayed at Sidi N'sir. 2/4th was the main Battalion engaged, with 1/4th Battalion in support. The 2/5th [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicesters]] was attached to the brigade as well. The situation was so precarious that the 2nd Hampshires, still training its new recruits, was put into the line alongside 1/4th Battalion. The brigade was supported by plenty of artillery and the [[Churchill tank]]s of the [[North Irish Horse]]. Extensive minefields and heavy dive bombing kept the German tanks at bay. On 28 February, a pre-dawn attack penetrated the 2/4th battalion's \u2018B\u2019 Company positions, but heroic resistance and the tanks of the North Irish Horse kept the Germans at bay until dusk, when \u2018B\u2019 Company was overrun. \u2018C\u2019 Company was overrun by German infantry. On 1 March, the Germans attacked again, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun, but 2/4th Battalion hung on to their remaining positions. On 2 March, the Germans withdrew, and on 5 March the 2/4th Battalion was relieved by the 8th Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] of [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Brigade]] of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th ''Battleaxe'' Division]]. The 2/4th Battalion had suffered 243 men killed or missing.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring March, the brigade was engaged on defensive patrolling, under heavy shelling. 1/4th Battalion lost 100 casualties during March, but 5th Battalion received 5 Officers and 150 men as replacements. On 5 April, the brigade handed over its positions and moved 100 miles south to El Ala. The 128th Brigade subsequently captured the Fondouk Gap, allowing the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]] to pass through and debouche onto the Kairouan Plain.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 114</ref> In April 1943, the 128th Infantry Brigade attacked Bou Arada. The 16th Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]] was added to the brigade for the attack. Five Field regiments and two Medium regiments of the Royal Artillery supported the 128th Brigade. Early progress was good, but when the mist cleared all four battalions were caught in the open under heavy fire, and losses mounted. The rifle companies of 1/4th Battalion only had 3 Officers and 80 men left between them and the 2/4th Battalion had to reorganise onto a three-company basis.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 117</ref>\n\nTunis fell and the [[North African Campaign]] was over in May 1943. The 128th Infantry Brigade was reconstituted to consist of 2nd Battalion, 1/4th Battalion and 5th Battalion. The 2/4th Battalion was split into two to form two Defence Units of two [[Beach groups|Beach Groups]]. Their role was to protect the maintenance area of a Beach Group when it made a landing where no port was available.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 119</ref>\n\nThe 128th Infantry Brigade was one of three British brigades that made an assault landing at [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] in Italy as part of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] under command of [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]], led by [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] in September 1943. The landing was opposed by shore batteries firing shrapnel, and the beaches were raked by machine gun fire. 2nd Battalion and 1/4th Battalion made steady progress, but 5th Battalion had been landed in the wrong place and suffered heavily. A German counter-attack overran \u2018B\u2019 Company and the Battalion HQ of 5th Battalion. The 5th Battalion lost 40 men killed and over 300 were wounded or taken prisoner.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn 12 September, the Germans started a general assault against the Salerno bridgehead, which made good progress; the [[VI Corps (United States)|US VI Corps]] were almost driven into the sea. However, the arrival of [[82nd Airborne Division|US paratroops]] and the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 7th Armoured Division]] turned the tide. The 128th Brigade was in the hills above Salerno, and the fighting was hard, but on 20 September the Germans began to withdraw northwards, and the pressure eased.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 144</ref> All three battalions had suffered \u2013 2nd Battalion suffered 304 casualties, 1/4th Battalion suffered 159 casualties and the 5th Battalion suffered 29 officer and over 400 other rank casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade, still part of the X Corps, moved up to the River Volturno, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. On 10 October, the 1/4th Battalion captured the town of Castel Volturno, alongside the river, and on 12 October the 1/4th made a night assault across the river, establishing a small bridgehead. The 2nd and 5th battalions moved across the river in support, but the entire 128th Brigade was soon engaged in a stiff fire-fight. The brigade advanced some 2,500 yards, and then dug in behind a canal as the Germans bought up tanks. The brigade remained in the low-lying, swampy, mosquito-ridden land between the river and the canal until the Germans withdrew due to a breakthrough elsewhere. The brigade then advanced along Route 7, meeting little resistance. The 128th Brigade was then taken out of the line for [[R&R (military)|R&R]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 151</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the Hampshire Brigade moved up to the River Garigliano. It was relieved on 11 January, and moved back to the River Volturno. They were selected as the Assault Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, and trained in river crossings. Then, in January 1944, the Hampshire Brigade made a night assault across the swift flowing River Garigliano. The brigade had severe problems getting the boats through the minefields down to the river, and in the darkness confusion reigned. Only a few men managed to get across, and these were withdrawn at daylight. The Hampshire Brigade then assaulted Monte Damiano, a bare, razor-backed feature, already strewn with British dead from [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]]. The assault was made by the 1/4th and 2nd battalions in daylight, and immediately came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. The attack was made with great dash, but it failed, with heavy casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th Battalion was put under the command of the [[138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade|138th Infantry Brigade]], part of the 46th Division, to assault Mounts Ornito and Cerasola in February 1944. The assault met little opposition, although the Germans put in spirited counter-attacks on Mount Ornito, which were all driven off. However, as the days passed, the casualties mounted from heavy shelling; the bare rock made cover difficult. In eight days, the 5th Battalion suffered 200 casualties. Supply was particularly difficult, as supplies had to be carried up by mules and porters for 3 to 4 hours from the nearest road. On 7 February, the 5th Battalion attacked Mount Cerasola, a successful assault. On 10 February, the 5th Battalion was relieved.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Brigade was relieved later in the month. It moved south to Naples and, on 16 March, sailed for Egypt, and subsequently moved to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and back to Egypt. All battalions were brought up to strength, largely from gunners from disbanded Middle-East Anti-Aircraft units who were retrained as infantrymen. On 27 June, the 128th Brigade sailed from Alexandria, and subsequently landed in Taranto. The move north through Italy was at an easy pace.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 185</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the 128th Brigade started its assault on the \"[[Gothic Line]]\", a line of German defences across the Etruscan Apennines. The Hampshire brigade, with the North Irish Horse under command, led the 46th Division's assault (along with the [[Reconnaissance Corps#Units|46th Reconnaissance Regiment]]). The brigade's first target was to cross the River Metauro and take Monte Bartolo. The assault went to plan against little opposition, and Mount Bartolo was captured by the morning of 29 August. The brigade had marched 25 miles to cover 12 miles as the crow flies, and climbed 1,500 feet. Only the 1/4th Battalion had come across serious opposition, engaging in heavy fighting around Montegaudio. Later in the month the brigade assaulted the Gothic Line proper, crossing the River Foglia and assaulting Monte Gridolfo. This was heavily defended, with all cover cleared from its bare slopes. Nevertheless, the men of the 2nd Battalion assaulted them with great vigour, and by dawn on 31 August they had captured the first crest. The 1/4th Battalion passed through, driving deeper into Gothic Line. During this assault, [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] [[Gerard Ross Norton|Gerard Norton]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. On 1 September, the 5th Battalion took the lead, and by 2 September had captured Meleto. The Gothic Line had been breached. A fighting advance continued northwards. On 5 September the 128th Brigade was relieved, and sent to the rear for rest, but they were back in the line by 11 September.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 191</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade began an assault on Montescudo in September 1944. Montescudo was defended by the German 100th Mountain Regiment, and they put up a desperate resistance. Other elements of the Brigade assaulted Trarivi, which was captured by 16 September. On 18 September, the brigade was relieved. All three battalions were short of men, even after replacements were received from the 1st Battalion, [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)]]. The Hampshire Brigade crossed the River Fiumicino, and then the Rubicon. The weather was atrocious, and movement was slowed by deep mud, and supply was difficult. Fighting continued until 9 October. A steady advance was made, and by 12 November the River Montone was crossed; on 26 November the [[Lamone (river)|River Lamone]] was reached. This was crossed on 3 December in the face of stiff opposition, and by 6 December the Brigade had captured Casa Nova. The Brigade was relieved the following day, and moved well to the rear. From 24 August (when the 128th Brigade moved up to the Gothic Line) to 7 December, when they were relieved, the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade had suffered 1,276 casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 203</ref>\n\nIn January 1945 the 2nd Battalion and the 5th Battalion embarked from Taranto and disembarked in Piraeus, Greece, two days later. 1/4th Battalion arrived on 22 January. The 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (now known as \"Tigerforce\") split its battalions, and set about disarming the [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S Army]]. The troops were welcomed everywhere, and there was no fighting. Then, in April 1945, the brigade began to return to Italy for the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|final offensive]]. By 1 May, the brigade was back in the line around Forlimpopoli; but the war ended before the brigade was in action again.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 210</ref>\n\n====The 2/4th Battalion====\nThe 20th [[Beach groups|Beach Group]] (\"A\" and \"B\" companies) invaded Sicily as part of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] in July 1943. The role of the Beach Group was to land supplies until a harbour could be captured. On 12 July, 20 Beach Group moved inland, behind the advancing infantry, but by 22 July the half-battalion was in the line, capturing Mount Scalpello. On 4 August, the half-battalion moved to Catania, where it remained on garrison duty.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 133</ref>\n\nIn September 1943, the 21st Beach Group (\"C\" and \"D\" companies) invaded Salerno. The assault went in at dawn against stiff opposition and, rather than take its allotted role, the half-battalion was moved straight into the line. However, there was little action until 13 September, when the half-battalion was attacked by armoured half-tracks. This happened again on 15 September when \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun. However, the half-tracks didn\u2019t assault \u2018D\u2019 Company as such, they ran over the slit trenches until picked off by [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|6pdr anti-tank guns]]. On 17 September, the half-battalion was moved back into reserve and, by 23 September, it was back on the beaches unloading cargo.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 136</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the two halves of the 2/4th Battalion were re-united at Pontecagnano near Salerno. However, there was no immediate employment, and orders were received to send cadres to the three battalions in the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] (this was rescinded after protests). However, six officers and 77 other ranks were posted away to form the \"2/4th Hampshire Training Centre\", three officers and 188 other ranks were assigned to \u2018porterage duties\u2019 and a detachment of 50 men was assigned to help the Provost Corps with traffic duties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 137</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was back in the line in Italy, near Garigliano, as part of [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Infantry Brigade]], in [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] in February 1944. This was the same ground where the Hampshire Brigade had suffered through the Italian winter. The battalion was relieved for short periods on a regular basis before returning to the line. In May 1944, the Battalion assisted the Brigade's two other battalions (2nd [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's]] and 2nd [[Somerset Light Infantry|Somersets]]) in crossing the River Rapido as part of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|assault on Monte Cassino]]. The river and bank were under intense enemy fire, and the river so swift that swimmers from 2/4th had to cross with lines to enable the boats to get across. Troops got across the river, but could make little headway against the storm of machine gun fire. The 2/4th could not get across to join their fellow battalions, and so, on 12 May, it came under command of [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th Infantry Brigade]] and crossed via a bridge on 13 May. Supported by the [[17th/21st Lancers]]'s [[Sherman tank]]s, the 2/4th Battalion attacked along the river, taking 200 prisoners. On 14 May, back in ther 28th Brigade, the 2/4th attempted to cross the River Pioppeta. The tank bridge sank in the mud, and the battalion took 100 casualties in two minutes. The 2/4th waded the river and, in spite of heavy casualties and fierce resistance, the advance continued. During this advance, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Richard Wakeford]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. By 6.30pm, all objectives had been captured, and the 2/4th reorganised on a three-company basis. On 16 May, the battalion was relieved. Two days later, Cassino was captured by the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 171</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, the Battalion was back in the line near the village of Villastrada, between Lake Chiusi and Lake Trasimeno to north of Rome. On 24 June, a major attack was launched on that section of the Trasimene Line by 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry supported by the tanks of the [[12e R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada|12th Canadian Armoured Regiment]]. 2/4th Hampshires was to follow on, but its entry into battle was delayed until the next day. Having passed through the village of Vaiano, which was unoccupied, an attack was launched on a ridge being held by the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]]. Although \"C\" Company established a foothold on the ridge, occupying a farmhouse, that night a fierce German counter-attack was made by the Germans, who overran the company headquarters. Fighting was close and confused, and the company ran low on ammunition. It was forced back to literally the last ditch, but hung on. At dawn the next day, 26 June, the battalion counter-attacked and managed to recapture its previous positions; the Germans were withdrawing to the Arezzo Line. The 2/4th Battalion followed up, coming into action again on 21 July. Supported by the [[North Irish Horse]], a steady advance was made. The 2/4th Battalion was then taken out of the line again \u2013 some platoons were down to ten men each with no officer.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 176</ref>\n\nThe Battalion then attacked Santa Lucia, which was captured on 30 July 1944 after a small but fierce battle. The enemy then withdrew, and the Battalion moved up to the River Arno. On 10 August, the battalion was withdrawn. In September 1944, the Battalion began its assault on the Gothic Line, attacking across the River Marano and capturing Casa Bagli. All the first day objectives were achieved, and the 2/4th defended them on 16 September against German counter-attacks. On 17 September, the battalion captured Cerasola; it was relieved the following day. The battalion then moved north behind the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]\u2019s advance, arriving in time to stand by to support the Hampshire Brigade's assault on Forli during November. During 22 November, the 2/4th attacked and captured a bridgehead over the River Cosina against heavy shelling; this was the battalion's last action in Italy.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 183</ref>\n\nIn December 1944, the Battalion was flown to Greece in the bomb-bays of Wellington and Liberator bombers in response to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]], arriving on 12 December. The [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S. Army]], armed and trained by the British, was trying to overthrow the [[Greek Government]]. On arrival, the 2/4th Battalion was split up, primarily defending the airfield, then clearing E.L.A.S. forces from Athens. This did involve some fighting, and the 2/4th Battalion lost three men killed. The 2/4th Battalion then settled down to peace-keeping duties. In May 1945, the Battalion was moved to Crete to take charge of the Germans, who had surrendered, and they ended the war there.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 209</ref>\n\n====The 7th Battalion====\nThe 7th Battalion was a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit, originally the 5/7th Battalion until it was split into the 5th and 7th battalions when the Territorial Army was doubled in size in the spring and summer of 1939. The 7th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom training long and hard for many years until after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\">Scott Daniell, p. 78</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was sent to Normandy as reinforcements with the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]] attached to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]. In June 1944, the Battalion landed near Le Hamel. They were with 130th Brigade (with 4th and 5th [[Dorset Regiment|Dorsets]]) and were initially held in reserve. The Battalion [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|attacked Maltot]], supported by tanks of [[9th Royal Tank Regiment]] (9th RTR) in July 1944. The village was defended by [[Waffen-SS]] troops supported by [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]]s. Both the 7th Battalion and 9th RTR suffered severe casualties, and although the 7th Battalion managed to fight its way into the village it was withdrawn. The 7th Battalion suffered 18 officer and 208 other rank casualties, including 4 officers and 12 other ranks killed, but was back in the line two days later.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 233</ref>\n\nThe Battalion attacked the village of Cahagnes later in the month. This was fought in typical \u2018[[bocage]]\u2019 countryside, but after the initial attack by the brigade ran into difficulties, 7th Battalion deployed from reserves and captured Cahagnes, beating off several [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] counter-attacks. On 2 August, the battalion moved up to Jurques, and after a short stiff fight advanced to \"Point 132\", close to [[Mont Pin\u00e7on|Mount Pincon]]. On 6 August, the battalion put in a deceptive attack on Mount Pincon, making a diversion whilst [[129th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|129th Infantry Brigade]] made a flank attack. During heavy fighting, 'C' Company incurred many casualties, including all the officers. Following the successful flank attack by the 129th Brigade, the 7th Battalion mopped up and concentrated near Mauny by 10 August.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 237</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the Battalion captured St Denis de Mere after a bombardment by nine artillery regiments. The Battalion took 74 prisoners and then prepared for \"The Breakout\". The Battalion then moved 50 miles north-east to Conches and, by 27 August, the 7th Battalion was across the River Seine. The battalion then participated in the capture of Tilly, and thereafter spent 11 days taking in replacements and resting. In September 1944, the Battalion started to move to Brussels for temporary garrison duty, arriving the next day. This easy duty was welcome; since landing in Normandy in June, the 7th Hampshires had lost (including wounded) 35 officers and 450 other ranks.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe Battalion fought in [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944. On 20 September, the battalion moved through Eindhoven to Grave. The battalion was tasked with defending the southern end of the two large bridges over the Waal. On 23 September, the 7th was sent into the line, fighting west of the bridges in the Valburg-Elst area. It then moved to the \"Island\" and stayed there until 4 October, before moving to the Groesbeek-Mook area on the Dutch-German border.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn November 1944, the Battalion was moved to Maastricht, and then moved around as divisional reserve. On 19 December, the German launched their [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]], which caused the 7th Battalion to move north of Liege to guard the bridges over the Meuse. On 26 December, the 7th Battalion moved to Aachen, and on 12 January moved again to Teveren. Then, in January 1945, the Battalion captured Putt, then Waldenrath, and on 25 January captured Dremmen and Porselen. The Battalion advanced south-east from Cleves as part of the big [[Operation Veritable|Reichwald offensive]]. Over two days fighting for Berkhofel, the 7th lost 70 casualties. It was relieved on 17 February.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 250</ref>\n\nThe Battalion [[Operation Plunder|crossed the Rhine]] in assault craft, consolidating on the far bank and then advancing across the IJssel Canal to Milligen, which was captured on 26 March. German resistance was collapsing, and the 7th moved over the Twente Canal on 1 April, liberating Hengelo. In April 1945, the 7th Battalion took part in operation \"Forward On\", sweeping through Germany against minimal resistance. However, on 13 April, the Battalion had a hard fight for Cloppenburg, a fight that was as hard as any they had fought, vicious hand-to-hand fighting from street to street. Luckily, they were supported by tanks, sappers of the [[Royal Engineers]] and a single [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]], which demolished several buildings with its petard. Cloppenburg was captured the next day. Then, in April, the Battalion embarked on its final advance, moving through Bahlum, Bremen, then Bremerhavan, capturing hundreds then thousands of prisoners. The 7th Battalion reached Gnarrenburg on 3 May, and were still there when the Germans surrendered the following day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 272</ref>\n\n====The Home Based Battalions====\nAlthough the Hampshire Regiment sent six battalions overseas, many more stayed at home as training units or were converted to other roles. Before the war, the 6th Battalion (Duke of Connaught's Own), Hampshire Regiment was converted into the 59th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, and upon the Territorial Army being doubled in size in 1939, formed a 2nd Line duplicate. The 59th Anti-Tank Regiment served with the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] and went with them to [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\"/>\n\nThe original [[Isle of Wight Rifles|8th Battalion (Isle of Wight Rifles)]], Hampshire Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and made into an artillery battery in 1937. However, a new 8th Battalion was formed, shortly after the war began, at Southampton in December 1939. It subsequently split into the 1/8th and 2/8th Battalions, before the 2/8th Battalion was renamed the 13th Battalion, and then both battalions were re-formed into the 8th Battalion again, which was subsequently renumbered the 30th Battalion and was disbanded in September 1942.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 79</ref>\n\nThe 9th Battalion was formed on the Isle of Wight in July 1940 and was later assigned to the [[201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]]. In 1942, the battalion was converted to armour as the 157th Regiment [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and assigned to [[36th Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Army Tank Brigade]]. Units converted in this way continued to wear their infantry cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.<ref>George Forty (1998), \"British Army Handbook 1939\u20131945\", Stoud: Sutton Publishing, pp. 50\u20131.</ref> However, the brigade was disbanded in July 1943 and 157 RAC was broken up in August, without having seen active service.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 81</ref>\n\nThe 10th Battalion was formed in Aldershot in July 1940; it was assigned to the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), alongside the 9th Battalion. In 1941, the 10th Hampshire was also transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, becoming the [[147th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]], and was assigned to the [[34th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|34th Army Tank Brigade]].<ref>Forty pp. 50\u20131.</ref> Its [[Churchill tank]]s were named after Hampshire Regiment battles (the [[Commanding officer|CO]]\u2019s tank was called \"Minden\"). The regiment went to serve with distinction with 34th Tank Brigade in the [[North West Europe Campaign]] at Normandy, [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]], the [[Operation Veritable|Reichswald Forest]] and [[Operation Plunder]] from 1944 to 1945 .<ref>Forty p. 345.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Britain, 1941 H10633.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 12th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment in training at Hengistbury Head near Bournemouth, Dorset. Wearing his gas mask, a soldier advances through a smoke screen.]]\n\nThe 50th (Holding) Battalion, which was formed on the Isle of Wight in June 1940, absorbed the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]]. The Jersey Militia subsequently became the 11th Battalion, whilst the rest of the 50th Battalion became the 12th Battalion. The 11th Battalion stayed in the United Kingdom as a training battalion until the war ended, first with the [[209th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|209th Brigade]] and later with the [[135th (2/1st South Western) Brigade|135th Brigade]], [[45th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|45th (Holding) Division]]. The 12th Battalion also stayed in the United Kingdom, with the [[136th (2/1st Devon and Cornwall) Brigade|136th Brigade]], but was disbanded in September 1944 after sending a large final draft to the 7th Battalion serving in North-west Europe.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 84</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was formed in Southampton, but soon moved to Basingstoke. It was raised for those soldiers around the age of 18 or 19 who had volunteered for the Army but were not old enough to be [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripted]], the age being 20 at the time. However, the battalion was disbanded in July 1943 as the British government lowered the age of conscription for the [[British Armed Forces]] from 20 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://16dli.awardspace.com/page305.html|title=The Officers of the 70th Young Soldiers Battalion, DLI, October 1941|accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Regiment's Depot had been in Winchester since long before the Second World War. However, in September 1939, it moved to Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, where it stayed for the rest of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dalyhistory.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/portsmouths-ww2-dead-the-hampshire-regiment-in-focus/|title=Portsmouth\u2019s World War II dead: The Hampshire Regiment in Focus|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Post war and amalgamation===\nIn 1946, the regiment was awarded the title of '''Royal Hampshire Regiment''' in recognition of its service during the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal corps and regiments - war service honours |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=10 December 1946}}</ref><ref>Army Order 167/1946</ref> The regiment was in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) in 1972 and undertook a further eight tours over the next two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-hampshire-regiment|title=Royal Hampshire Regiment|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> In 1992, as part of the [[Options for Change]] reorganisations, the regiment was merged with the [[Queen's Regiment]] to become the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/23994.aspx|title=The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Regimental museum==\nThe [[Lower Barracks#Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum|Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum]] is based at [[Lower Barracks]] in [[Winchester]].

One of its duties was to look after the large number of Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] after the fall of Sidi Barrani.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 50</ref>\n\nIn February 1941, the 1st Battalion arrived in [[Malta]], where it became part of the 1st (Malta) Infantry Brigade (with 1st [[Dorset Regiment]] and 2nd [[Devonshire Regiment]]). This later became the [[231st Brigade (United Kingdom)|231st Infantry Brigade]]. Duties in Malta included airfield repair and working as stevedores in the docks. Malta was subjected to a [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|prolonged siege]] and, by July 1942, the food situation had become serious, but the situation eased as the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' fortunes improved in the [[North African Campaign]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 55</ref>\n\nIn April 1943, the 231st Brigade, including the 1st Hampshires, was moved to Alexandria, then subsequently to Cairo and Suez, where it trained as an [[Brigade group|independent assault brigade]]. Then, in July 1943, the 1st Battalion invaded [[Sicily]] as part of the first wave of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The beach landing went smoothly, but the 1st Battalion ran into resistance at [[Vizzini]] on 13 July when it ran into the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Herman Goring Parachute Panzer Division]]. On 22 July, the 1st Battalion was engaged in hard fighting for Agria, which only fell on 29 July. The 1st Battalion was reduced to three companies after the battle. There was further hard fighting to capture the Regalbuto Ridge, which ended the Sicilian Campaign. The 1st Battalion suffered 18 Officers and 286 Other Ranks killed or wounded in action in Sicily.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 128</ref>\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the 231st Brigade [[Allied invasion of Italy|landed in Italy]], coming ashore at Potro San Venere near Pizzo. The 1st Battalion was involved in fighting as the Germans withdrew northwards. By October 1943, the 1st Battalion was back in Sicily waiting for transport back to the United Kingdom and, by November, the battalion was back in the United Kingdom for the first time in 22 years.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 131</ref>\n\nThe battalion was allocated to the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]], one of the assault divisions for the [[Invasion of Normandy|invasion of North West Europe]], which had an excellent reputation after fighting in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]]. On 6 June 1944, the 1st Battalion came ashore as part of [[Operation Overlord]] without any supporting tanks. Despite facing machine gun fire, the men captured Le Hamel and Arromanches after a hard fight. By the end of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] , the 1st Battalion had suffered 182 casualties, 64 of them being killed in action.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 219</ref>\n\nThe Battalion started a three-week fight for the village of Hottot, against the German [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]], in June 1944. This culminated in a major assault on 11 July. The 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line the next day, testimony to the hard fighting. The Battalion was in the vanguard of the assault towards Villiers Bocage later in the month. There were stiff fights at St Germain d\u2019Ectot and Launay. Villiers Bocage was taken on 4 August, following which the 50th Division was taken out of the line.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 228</ref>\nIn August 1944, a brigade attack was launched towards Conde, and the Battalion attacked St Pierre la Vielle. The fighting was particularly hard and, after the 11-hour battle, three of its [[Rifle company|Rifle companies]] were severely reduced \u2013 \u2018B\u2019 Company had 25 men, \u2018C\u2019 Company had 35 men, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was down to just 12 men; as \u2018A\u2019 Company was only lightly engaged, it was not so depleted. On 12 August, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn from the line. The Battalion was [[Motorized infantry|motorised]] and joined with the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] for the breakout attack later in the month. There was no fighting and, on 31 August, the 1st Battalion crossed the river Seine at Vernon and swept on to Amiens.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was then placed under command of the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and swept into Brussels on 3 September. The Battalion, still under command of the Guards Armoured, then started the attack towards Eindhoven, which was the attack designed to relieve the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|Polish]] [[Airborne forces|airborne troops]] [[Battle of Arnhem|fighting at Arnhem]], who had dropped as part of [[Operation Market Garden]], which ended in a failure. The Battalion, as part of 231st Infantry Brigade, was charged with defending the \"Corridor\" formed by the armoured advance. In October, the 1st Battalion moved up to Nijmegen and moved onto \"The Island\", the bridgehead over the river Waal but behind the river Lek.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 242</ref>\n\nIn October 1944, the Battalion attacked north of Bemmel, and expanded the bridgehead up to the Wettering Canal. The Battalion then went onto the defensive until the end of November. The Battalion then moved back to Ypres in Belgium, and subsequently was moved back to the United Kingdom with the rest of the 50th Division, and the men were mainly used as replacements for other infantry battalions, with the exception of a small training [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] consisting of 12 officers and 100 other ranks. The battalion ended the war in Louth, Lincolnshire.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 244</ref> Since D-Day, the 1st Battalion, Hampshire Regiment had suffered over 1,281 casualties, including 231 officers and men killed in action, the rest being either wounded or missing in action.<ref>Monty's Northern Legions: 50th Northumbrian and 15th Scottish Divisions at War 1939-1945: Patrick Delaforce</ref>\n\n====The 2nd Battalion====\nThe 2nd Battalion was also a [[Regular army|Regular Army]] battalion and started the war in Aldershot, Hampshire, England.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 59</ref> In September 1939, the 2nd Battalion moved to Cherbourg, France with the [[1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Guards Brigade]], alongside the 3rd Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]] and the 2nd Battalion, [[Coldstream Guards]], attached to [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Infantry Division]]. It then moved to Sille-le-Guillaume, and from there 250 miles north to take its allocated place on the \"Gort Line\", which it reached on 3 October. Later that month, the Battalion moved to the Belgian/French border and, in February 1940, the Battalion spent three weeks on the Maginot Line before returning to Metz.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 61</ref>\n\nThe Battalion crossed into Belgium in response to the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]] and, by 14 May, was digging into a defensive position. While an attack never came, with the retreat of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch]] and the [[Ninth Army (France)|French Ninth Army]], the 1st Division was ordered to retreat on 16 May. A slow retreat then commenced, ending at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. The Battalion began to be embarked from Dunkirk for the United Kingdom (some were evacuated on 2 June). The battalion managed to carry away 100% of their small-arms, mortars and anti-tank rifles. It was congratulated by the Minister for War, Mr [[Anthony Eden]]. The battalion then spent two years on home defence, training and preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] that never arrived.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn November 1942, the Battalion, Hampshire Regiment sailed for [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], taking part in [[Operation Torch]] with the 1st Guards Brigade, which was now part of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Division]]. They disembarked at Algiers on 21 November and joined the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]]. Later that month, the Battalion moved to Tebourba.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 89</ref> The following day the 2nd Battalion were attacked by heavy shelling and, on 1 December, the Battalion was attacked by a force four times its size, which was able to outflank it and rake it with enfilading fire. This was the start of three days of fierce close combat, fought at close quarters and featuring bayonet charges and counter-charges. The battalion was forced back a mile and a half and, on 3 December, [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Wallace Le Patourel]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his gallantry in leading counter-attacks against the enemy. After three days, the Battalion retreated through Tebourba, only to find all other troops had been withdrawn and the road behind them was cut. The battalion broke into small groups and attempted to break through to allied lines, reuniting at Medjez-el-Bab; many, including the [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]], were captured. The Battalion, which had started the battle with 689 men, was down to 194 men. The battalion was withdrawn from the line and in December, nine officers and 260 other ranks joined the 2nd Battalion.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 99</ref> After the fall of Tunis on 13 May 1943, the 2nd Battalion joined the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] attached to [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th (West Riding) Infantry Division]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 118</ref>\n\n====The 128th Infantry Brigade====\nThe Hampshire Regiment had a number of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) battalions, whose ranks were swelled throughout 1939 when the TA was ordered to be doubled in size. During 1939, due to the number of new recruits, the 5/7th Battalion was split into the 5th Battalion and the 7th Battalion, and the 4th Battalion was split into the 1/4th Battalion and the 2/4th Battalion. The 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th Battalions were all grouped into the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th Infantry Brigade]] (the \"Hampshire Brigade\") and the 7th Battalion was part of the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]].

The 5th Battalion at Sidi N'sir was attacked in overwhelming strength in February 1943 as the Germans began Operation \"Ox Head\", a Corps level assault by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|German Paratroopers]], elements of [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] and the 501st Heavy Tank Battalion. The 5th Battalion was supported by 155th Battery, [[Royal Artillery]]. The Germans had to take the Hampshires' hilltop positions before they could attack the artillery, knocking out all the guns, whose crews stood and died firing over open sights at the German tanks. Only nine gunners survived. At 5pm, \u2018B\u2019 Company of the 5th Battalion, reduced to 30 men, was overrun. At dusk, the battalion considered its position untenable, and it withdrew to a feature known as \"Hampshire Farm\". Of the four [[Company (military unit)|Rifle Companies]], only \u2018C\u2019 Company, less a single [[platoon]], and 30 men of \u2018D\u2019 Company, remained. The German force was delayed for one critical day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 107</ref>\n\nLater in the month, the Hampshire Brigade was attacked at Hunt's Gap by the German force that had been delayed at Sidi N'sir. 2/4th was the main Battalion engaged, with 1/4th Battalion in support. The 2/5th [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|Leicesters]] was attached to the brigade as well. The situation was so precarious that the 2nd Hampshires, still training its new recruits, was put into the line alongside 1/4th Battalion. The brigade was supported by plenty of artillery and the [[Churchill tank]]s of the [[North Irish Horse]]. Extensive minefields and heavy dive bombing kept the German tanks at bay. On 28 February, a pre-dawn attack penetrated the 2/4th battalion's \u2018B\u2019 Company positions, but heroic resistance and the tanks of the North Irish Horse kept the Germans at bay until dusk, when \u2018B\u2019 Company was overrun. \u2018C\u2019 Company was overrun by German infantry. On 1 March, the Germans attacked again, and \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun, but 2/4th Battalion hung on to their remaining positions. On 2 March, the Germans withdrew, and on 5 March the 2/4th Battalion was relieved by the 8th Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] of [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Brigade]] of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th ''Battleaxe'' Division]]. The 2/4th Battalion had suffered 243 men killed or missing.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring March, the brigade was engaged on defensive patrolling, under heavy shelling. 1/4th Battalion lost 100 casualties during March, but 5th Battalion received 5 Officers and 150 men as replacements. On 5 April, the brigade handed over its positions and moved 100 miles south to El Ala. The 128th Brigade subsequently captured the Fondouk Gap, allowing the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured Division]] to pass through and debouche onto the Kairouan Plain.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 114</ref> In April 1943, the 128th Infantry Brigade attacked Bou Arada. The 16th Battalion, [[Durham Light Infantry]] was added to the brigade for the attack. Five Field regiments and two Medium regiments of the Royal Artillery supported the 128th Brigade. Early progress was good, but when the mist cleared all four battalions were caught in the open under heavy fire, and losses mounted. The rifle companies of 1/4th Battalion only had 3 Officers and 80 men left between them and the 2/4th Battalion had to reorganise onto a three-company basis.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 117</ref>\n\nTunis fell and the [[North African Campaign]] was over in May 1943. The 128th Infantry Brigade was reconstituted to consist of 2nd Battalion, 1/4th Battalion and 5th Battalion. The 2/4th Battalion was split into two to form two Defence Units of two [[Beach groups|Beach Groups]]. Their role was to protect the maintenance area of a Beach Group when it made a landing where no port was available.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 119</ref>\n\nThe 128th Infantry Brigade was one of three British brigades that made an assault landing at [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] in Italy as part of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] under command of [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]], led by [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] in September 1943. The landing was opposed by shore batteries firing shrapnel, and the beaches were raked by machine gun fire. 2nd Battalion and 1/4th Battalion made steady progress, but 5th Battalion had been landed in the wrong place and suffered heavily. A German counter-attack overran \u2018B\u2019 Company and the Battalion HQ of 5th Battalion. The 5th Battalion lost 40 men killed and over 300 were wounded or taken prisoner.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 142</ref>\n\nOn 12 September, the Germans started a general assault against the Salerno bridgehead, which made good progress; the [[VI Corps (United States)|US VI Corps]] were almost driven into the sea. However, the arrival of [[82nd Airborne Division|US paratroops]] and the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 7th Armoured Division]] turned the tide. The 128th Brigade was in the hills above Salerno, and the fighting was hard, but on 20 September the Germans began to withdraw northwards, and the pressure eased.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 144</ref> All three battalions had suffered \u2013 2nd Battalion suffered 304 casualties, 1/4th Battalion suffered 159 casualties and the 5th Battalion suffered 29 officer and over 400 other rank casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 146</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade, still part of the X Corps, moved up to the River Volturno, behind which the Germans had withdrawn. On 10 October, the 1/4th Battalion captured the town of Castel Volturno, alongside the river, and on 12 October the 1/4th made a night assault across the river, establishing a small bridgehead. The 2nd and 5th battalions moved across the river in support, but the entire 128th Brigade was soon engaged in a stiff fire-fight. The brigade advanced some 2,500 yards, and then dug in behind a canal as the Germans bought up tanks. The brigade remained in the low-lying, swampy, mosquito-ridden land between the river and the canal until the Germans withdrew due to a breakthrough elsewhere. The brigade then advanced along Route 7, meeting little resistance. The 128th Brigade was then taken out of the line for [[R&R (military)|R&R]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 151</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the Hampshire Brigade moved up to the River Garigliano. It was relieved on 11 January, and moved back to the River Volturno. They were selected as the Assault Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division, and trained in river crossings. Then, in January 1944, the Hampshire Brigade made a night assault across the swift flowing River Garigliano. The brigade had severe problems getting the boats through the minefields down to the river, and in the darkness confusion reigned. Only a few men managed to get across, and these were withdrawn at daylight. The Hampshire Brigade then assaulted Monte Damiano, a bare, razor-backed feature, already strewn with British dead from [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]]. The assault was made by the 1/4th and 2nd battalions in daylight, and immediately came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. The attack was made with great dash, but it failed, with heavy casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 157</ref>\n\nThe 5th Battalion was put under the command of the [[138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade|138th Infantry Brigade]], part of the 46th Division, to assault Mounts Ornito and Cerasola in February 1944. The assault met little opposition, although the Germans put in spirited counter-attacks on Mount Ornito, which were all driven off. However, as the days passed, the casualties mounted from heavy shelling; the bare rock made cover difficult. In eight days, the 5th Battalion suffered 200 casualties. Supply was particularly difficult, as supplies had to be carried up by mules and porters for 3 to 4 hours from the nearest road. On 7 February, the 5th Battalion attacked Mount Cerasola, a successful assault. On 10 February, the 5th Battalion was relieved.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 161</ref>\n\nThe Hampshire Brigade was relieved later in the month. It moved south to Naples and, on 16 March, sailed for Egypt, and subsequently moved to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and back to Egypt. All battalions were brought up to strength, largely from gunners from disbanded Middle-East Anti-Aircraft units who were retrained as infantrymen. On 27 June, the 128th Brigade sailed from Alexandria, and subsequently landed in Taranto. The move north through Italy was at an easy pace.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 185</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the 128th Brigade started its assault on the \"[[Gothic Line]]\", a line of German defences across the Etruscan Apennines. The Hampshire brigade, with the North Irish Horse under command, led the 46th Division's assault (along with the [[Reconnaissance Corps#Units|46th Reconnaissance Regiment]]). The brigade's first target was to cross the River Metauro and take Monte Bartolo. The assault went to plan against little opposition, and Mount Bartolo was captured by the morning of 29 August. The brigade had marched 25 miles to cover 12 miles as the crow flies, and climbed 1,500 feet. Only the 1/4th Battalion had come across serious opposition, engaging in heavy fighting around Montegaudio. Later in the month the brigade assaulted the Gothic Line proper, crossing the River Foglia and assaulting Monte Gridolfo. This was heavily defended, with all cover cleared from its bare slopes. Nevertheless, the men of the 2nd Battalion assaulted them with great vigour, and by dawn on 31 August they had captured the first crest. The 1/4th Battalion passed through, driving deeper into Gothic Line. During this assault, [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] [[Gerard Ross Norton|Gerard Norton]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. On 1 September, the 5th Battalion took the lead, and by 2 September had captured Meleto. The Gothic Line had been breached. A fighting advance continued northwards. On 5 September the 128th Brigade was relieved, and sent to the rear for rest, but they were back in the line by 11 September.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 191</ref>\n\nThe 128th Brigade began an assault on Montescudo in September 1944. Montescudo was defended by the German 100th Mountain Regiment, and they put up a desperate resistance. Other elements of the Brigade assaulted Trarivi, which was captured by 16 September. On 18 September, the brigade was relieved. All three battalions were short of men, even after replacements were received from the 1st Battalion, [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)]]. The Hampshire Brigade crossed the River Fiumicino, and then the Rubicon. The weather was atrocious, and movement was slowed by deep mud, and supply was difficult. Fighting continued until 9 October. A steady advance was made, and by 12 November the River Montone was crossed; on 26 November the [[Lamone (river)|River Lamone]] was reached. This was crossed on 3 December in the face of stiff opposition, and by 6 December the Brigade had captured Casa Nova. The Brigade was relieved the following day, and moved well to the rear. From 24 August (when the 128th Brigade moved up to the Gothic Line) to 7 December, when they were relieved, the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade had suffered 1,276 casualties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 203</ref>\n\nIn January 1945 the 2nd Battalion and the 5th Battalion embarked from Taranto and disembarked in Piraeus, Greece, two days later. 1/4th Battalion arrived on 22 January. The 128th (Hampshire) Brigade (now known as \"Tigerforce\") split its battalions, and set about disarming the [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S Army]]. The troops were welcomed everywhere, and there was no fighting. Then, in April 1945, the brigade began to return to Italy for the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|final offensive]]. By 1 May, the brigade was back in the line around Forlimpopoli; but the war ended before the brigade was in action again.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 210</ref>\n\n====The 2/4th Battalion====\nThe 20th [[Beach groups|Beach Group]] (\"A\" and \"B\" companies) invaded Sicily as part of [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Operation Husky]] in July 1943. The role of the Beach Group was to land supplies until a harbour could be captured. On 12 July, 20 Beach Group moved inland, behind the advancing infantry, but by 22 July the half-battalion was in the line, capturing Mount Scalpello. On 4 August, the half-battalion moved to Catania, where it remained on garrison duty.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 133</ref>\n\nIn September 1943, the 21st Beach Group (\"C\" and \"D\" companies) invaded Salerno. The assault went in at dawn against stiff opposition and, rather than take its allotted role, the half-battalion was moved straight into the line. However, there was little action until 13 September, when the half-battalion was attacked by armoured half-tracks. This happened again on 15 September when \u2018D\u2019 Company was overrun. However, the half-tracks didn\u2019t assault \u2018D\u2019 Company as such, they ran over the slit trenches until picked off by [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|6pdr anti-tank guns]]. On 17 September, the half-battalion was moved back into reserve and, by 23 September, it was back on the beaches unloading cargo.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 136</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the two halves of the 2/4th Battalion were re-united at Pontecagnano near Salerno. However, there was no immediate employment, and orders were received to send cadres to the three battalions in the [[128th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|128th (Hampshire) Brigade]] (this was rescinded after protests). However, six officers and 77 other ranks were posted away to form the \"2/4th Hampshire Training Centre\", three officers and 188 other ranks were assigned to \u2018porterage duties\u2019 and a detachment of 50 men was assigned to help the Provost Corps with traffic duties.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 137</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was back in the line in Italy, near Garigliano, as part of [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th Infantry Brigade]], in [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]] in February 1944. This was the same ground where the Hampshire Brigade had suffered through the Italian winter. The battalion was relieved for short periods on a regular basis before returning to the line. In May 1944, the Battalion assisted the Brigade's two other battalions (2nd [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's]] and 2nd [[Somerset Light Infantry|Somersets]]) in crossing the River Rapido as part of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|assault on Monte Cassino]]. The river and bank were under intense enemy fire, and the river so swift that swimmers from 2/4th had to cross with lines to enable the boats to get across. Troops got across the river, but could make little headway against the storm of machine gun fire. The 2/4th could not get across to join their fellow battalions, and so, on 12 May, it came under command of [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th Infantry Brigade]] and crossed via a bridge on 13 May. Supported by the [[17th/21st Lancers]]'s [[Sherman tank]]s, the 2/4th Battalion attacked along the river, taking 200 prisoners. On 14 May, back in ther 28th Brigade, the 2/4th attempted to cross the River Pioppeta. The tank bridge sank in the mud, and the battalion took 100 casualties in two minutes. The 2/4th waded the river and, in spite of heavy casualties and fierce resistance, the advance continued. During this advance, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] [[Richard Wakeford]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. By 6.30pm, all objectives had been captured, and the 2/4th reorganised on a three-company basis. On 16 May, the battalion was relieved. Two days later, Cassino was captured by the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]].<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 171</ref>\n\nIn June 1944, the Battalion was back in the line near the village of Villastrada, between Lake Chiusi and Lake Trasimeno to north of Rome. On 24 June, a major attack was launched on that section of the Trasimene Line by 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry supported by the tanks of the [[12e R\u00e9giment blind\u00e9 du Canada|12th Canadian Armoured Regiment]]. 2/4th Hampshires was to follow on, but its entry into battle was delayed until the next day. Having passed through the village of Vaiano, which was unoccupied, an attack was launched on a ridge being held by the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]]. Although \"C\" Company established a foothold on the ridge, occupying a farmhouse, that night a fierce German counter-attack was made by the Germans, who overran the company headquarters. Fighting was close and confused, and the company ran low on ammunition. It was forced back to literally the last ditch, but hung on. At dawn the next day, 26 June, the battalion counter-attacked and managed to recapture its previous positions; the Germans were withdrawing to the Arezzo Line. The 2/4th Battalion followed up, coming into action again on 21 July. Supported by the [[North Irish Horse]], a steady advance was made. The 2/4th Battalion was then taken out of the line again \u2013 some platoons were down to ten men each with no officer.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 176</ref>\n\nThe Battalion then attacked Santa Lucia, which was captured on 30 July 1944 after a small but fierce battle. The enemy then withdrew, and the Battalion moved up to the River Arno. On 10 August, the battalion was withdrawn. In September 1944, the Battalion began its assault on the Gothic Line, attacking across the River Marano and capturing Casa Bagli. All the first day objectives were achieved, and the 2/4th defended them on 16 September against German counter-attacks. On 17 September, the battalion captured Cerasola; it was relieved the following day. The battalion then moved north behind the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]\u2019s advance, arriving in time to stand by to support the Hampshire Brigade's assault on Forli during November. During 22 November, the 2/4th attacked and captured a bridgehead over the River Cosina against heavy shelling; this was the battalion's last action in Italy.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 183</ref>\n\nIn December 1944, the Battalion was flown to Greece in the bomb-bays of Wellington and Liberator bombers in response to the outbreak of the [[Greek Civil War]], arriving on 12 December. The [[Greek People's Liberation Army|E.L.A.S. Army]], armed and trained by the British, was trying to overthrow the [[Greek Government]]. On arrival, the 2/4th Battalion was split up, primarily defending the airfield, then clearing E.L.A.S. forces from Athens. This did involve some fighting, and the 2/4th Battalion lost three men killed. The 2/4th Battalion then settled down to peace-keeping duties. In May 1945, the Battalion was moved to Crete to take charge of the Germans, who had surrendered, and they ended the war there.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 209</ref>\n\n====The 7th Battalion====\nThe 7th Battalion was a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit, originally the 5/7th Battalion until it was split into the 5th and 7th battalions when the Territorial Army was doubled in size in the spring and summer of 1939. The 7th Battalion remained in the United Kingdom training long and hard for many years until after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\">Scott Daniell, p. 78</ref>\n\nThe Battalion was sent to Normandy as reinforcements with the [[130th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|130th Infantry Brigade]] attached to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]]. In June 1944, the Battalion landed near Le Hamel. They were with 130th Brigade (with 4th and 5th [[Dorset Regiment|Dorsets]]) and were initially held in reserve. The Battalion [[Operation Jupiter (1944)|attacked Maltot]], supported by tanks of [[9th Royal Tank Regiment]] (9th RTR) in July 1944. The village was defended by [[Waffen-SS]] troops supported by [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]]s. Both the 7th Battalion and 9th RTR suffered severe casualties, and although the 7th Battalion managed to fight its way into the village it was withdrawn. The 7th Battalion suffered 18 officer and 208 other rank casualties, including 4 officers and 12 other ranks killed, but was back in the line two days later.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 233</ref>\n\nThe Battalion attacked the village of Cahagnes later in the month. This was fought in typical \u2018[[bocage]]\u2019 countryside, but after the initial attack by the brigade ran into difficulties, 7th Battalion deployed from reserves and captured Cahagnes, beating off several [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] counter-attacks. On 2 August, the battalion moved up to Jurques, and after a short stiff fight advanced to \"Point 132\", close to [[Mont Pin\u00e7on|Mount Pincon]]. On 6 August, the battalion put in a deceptive attack on Mount Pincon, making a diversion whilst [[129th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|129th Infantry Brigade]] made a flank attack. During heavy fighting, 'C' Company incurred many casualties, including all the officers. Following the successful flank attack by the 129th Brigade, the 7th Battalion mopped up and concentrated near Mauny by 10 August.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 237</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, the Battalion captured St Denis de Mere after a bombardment by nine artillery regiments. The Battalion took 74 prisoners and then prepared for \"The Breakout\". The Battalion then moved 50 miles north-east to Conches and, by 27 August, the 7th Battalion was across the River Seine. The battalion then participated in the capture of Tilly, and thereafter spent 11 days taking in replacements and resting. In September 1944, the Battalion started to move to Brussels for temporary garrison duty, arriving the next day. This easy duty was welcome; since landing in Normandy in June, the 7th Hampshires had lost (including wounded) 35 officers and 450 other ranks.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe Battalion fought in [[Operation Market Garden]] in September 1944. On 20 September, the battalion moved through Eindhoven to Grave. The battalion was tasked with defending the southern end of the two large bridges over the Waal. On 23 September, the 7th was sent into the line, fighting west of the bridges in the Valburg-Elst area. It then moved to the \"Island\" and stayed there until 4 October, before moving to the Groesbeek-Mook area on the Dutch-German border.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn November 1944, the Battalion was moved to Maastricht, and then moved around as divisional reserve. On 19 December, the German launched their [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]], which caused the 7th Battalion to move north of Liege to guard the bridges over the Meuse. On 26 December, the 7th Battalion moved to Aachen, and on 12 January moved again to Teveren. Then, in January 1945, the Battalion captured Putt, then Waldenrath, and on 25 January captured Dremmen and Porselen. The Battalion advanced south-east from Cleves as part of the big [[Operation Veritable|Reichwald offensive]]. Over two days fighting for Berkhofel, the 7th lost 70 casualties. It was relieved on 17 February.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 250</ref>\n\nThe Battalion [[Operation Plunder|crossed the Rhine]] in assault craft, consolidating on the far bank and then advancing across the IJssel Canal to Milligen, which was captured on 26 March. German resistance was collapsing, and the 7th moved over the Twente Canal on 1 April, liberating Hengelo. In April 1945, the 7th Battalion took part in operation \"Forward On\", sweeping through Germany against minimal resistance. However, on 13 April, the Battalion had a hard fight for Cloppenburg, a fight that was as hard as any they had fought, vicious hand-to-hand fighting from street to street. Luckily, they were supported by tanks, sappers of the [[Royal Engineers]] and a single [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]], which demolished several buildings with its petard. Cloppenburg was captured the next day. Then, in April, the Battalion embarked on its final advance, moving through Bahlum, Bremen, then Bremerhavan, capturing hundreds then thousands of prisoners. The 7th Battalion reached Gnarrenburg on 3 May, and were still there when the Germans surrendered the following day.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 272</ref>\n\n====The Home Based Battalions====\nAlthough the Hampshire Regiment sent six battalions overseas, many more stayed at home as training units or were converted to other roles. Before the war, the 6th Battalion (Duke of Connaught's Own), Hampshire Regiment was converted into the 59th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, and upon the Territorial Army being doubled in size in 1939, formed a 2nd Line duplicate. The 59th Anti-Tank Regiment served with the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] and went with them to [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]].<ref name=\"Scott Daniell, p. 78\"/>\n\nThe original [[Isle of Wight Rifles|8th Battalion (Isle of Wight Rifles)]], Hampshire Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and made into an artillery battery in 1937. However, a new 8th Battalion was formed, shortly after the war began, at Southampton in December 1939. It subsequently split into the 1/8th and 2/8th Battalions, before the 2/8th Battalion was renamed the 13th Battalion, and then both battalions were re-formed into the 8th Battalion again, which was subsequently renumbered the 30th Battalion and was disbanded in September 1942.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 79</ref>\n\nThe 9th Battalion was formed on the Isle of Wight in July 1940 and was later assigned to the [[201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home)]]. In 1942, the battalion was converted to armour as the 157th Regiment [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and assigned to [[36th Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Army Tank Brigade]]. Units converted in this way continued to wear their infantry cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.<ref>George Forty (1998), \"British Army Handbook 1939\u20131945\", Stoud: Sutton Publishing, pp. 50\u20131.</ref> However, the brigade was disbanded in July 1943 and 157 RAC was broken up in August, without having seen active service.<ref>Scott Daniell, p. 81</ref>\n\nThe 10th Battalion was formed in Aldershot in July 1940; it was assigned to the 201st Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), alongside the 9th Battalion. In 1941, the 10th Hampshire was also transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, becoming the [[147th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]], and was assigned to the [[34th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|34th Army Tank Brigade]].<ref>Forty pp. 50\u20131.</ref> Its [[Churchill tank]]s were named after Hampshire Regiment battles (the [[Commanding officer|CO]]\u2019s tank was called \"Minden\"). The regiment went to serve with distinction with 34th Tank Brigade in the [[North West Europe Campaign]] at Normandy, [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]], the [[Operation Veritable|Reichswald Forest]] and [[Operation Plunder]] from 1944 to 1945 .<ref>Forty p. 345.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Britain, 1941 H10633.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 12th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment in training at Hengistbury Head near Bournemouth, Dorset. Wearing his gas mask, a soldier advances through a smoke screen.]]\n\nThe 50th (Holding) Battalion, which was formed on the Isle of Wight in June 1940, absorbed the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]]. The Jersey Militia subsequently became the 11th Battalion, whilst the rest of the 50th Battalion became the 12th Battalion. The 11th Battalion stayed in the United Kingdom as a training battalion until the war ended, first with the [[209th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|209th Brigade]] and later with the [[135th (2/1st South Western) Brigade|135th Brigade]], [[45th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|45th (Holding) Division]].
