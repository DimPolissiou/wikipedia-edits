Logan was a [[WAMPAS Baby Stars|WAMPAS Baby Star]] of 1922.\n\n==Early life==\nLogan was born in [[Corsicana, Texas]],<ref name=hr/> on November 30, 1904.

Her childhood was spent in [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]] where she briefly worked as a journalist for the ''[[Scottsbluff Republican]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Even a Movie Star Can't Always Get an Airplane|work=Morning World-Herald|location=Omaha|publication-date=March 19, 1926}}</ref>\n\n==Stage career and Broadway==\nLogan traveled to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], for her health{{Citation needed |date=June 2019}} and acted in [[Repertory theatre|stock theater]] there.<ref>{{cite news |title=Newest Star Tells How to 'Short Cut' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33216635/jacqueline_logan/ |accessdate=25 June 2019 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=February 22, 1921 |location=Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh |page=6|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> While there she took a course in journalism from [[Ford Frick]], who later became commissioner of Major League Baseball. Setting out to Chicago, Logan found employment dancing in a stage production of a theater. Her family believed she intended to visit an uncle in the windy city and also attend college. To get the job she lied about her age, and when her uncle found out, he was irate. She was let go from the stage job as a result.{{Citation needed |date=June 2019}} \n\nShe left Chicago and set out for New York City. Again Logan was untruthful regarding her intentions. With her on her trip to New York was a theatrical troupe.

She replaced Billie Donovan who was leaving to act in films in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Together with the Ziegfeld venture, Logan modeled as a Dobbs Girl in [[Alfred Cheney Johnston]] photographs. She also had a part in a Johnny Hines' comedy short.{{Citation needed |date=June 2019}} Her other Broadway credits included ''Two Strange Women'' (1933) and ''Merrily We Roll Along'' (1934).<ref name=ibdb/>\n\n==Motion pictures==\nLogan was awarded a screen test with the then unknown actor [[Ben Lyon]]. Lyon was the husband of Hollywood actress [[Bebe Daniels]] and became a prominent figure in the movies. Later he furthered the careers of such stars as [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Working for Associated Producers, Logan was featured opposite Jane Peters, the future [[Carole Lombard]] in the film ''The Perfect Crime'' (1921). Peters was only a youth, appearing as a pretty blonde child actress. The same year she played with [[Mabel Normand]] in ''[[Molly O (1921 film)|Molly O']]'' (1921).\n\n[[File:Jacqueline Logan The Blue Book of the Screen.jpg|thumb|right|Publicity photo of Logan from ''The Blue Book of the Screen'' by Ruth Wing (1923)]]\nOther features she starred in during the early 1920s include ''Burning Sands'' (1922), ''[[A Blind Bargain]]'' (1922), ''Sixty Cents an Hour'' (1923), ''[[Java Head (1923 film)|Java Head]]'' (1923), and ''A Man Must Live'' (1924). Among her co-stars were [[Thomas Meighan]], [[Milton Sills]], [[Ricardo Cortez]], [[Leatrice Joy]], [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]], [[Lon Chaney Sr.]], and [[William Powell]].

The movie broke records for audience attendance. It was shown somewhere in the world each day for decades after its release. When talking pictures began, Logan's voice was recorded to accompany her acting part in the original silent film.\n\nThe actress of silent films was largely unsuccessful in the new medium of ''[[talkies]]''. In an early musical, ''Show of Shows'' (1929), Logan was a member of an all-star cast. This followed her work in some early and profitable sound films for [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Writer and director of films==\nLogan was in England for a time to do stage work such as ''Smoky Cell''. This gained for her some good reviews. After completing the English film ''Middle Watch'', she was awarded a Command Performance. [[Associated British Picture Corporation|British International Pictures]] signed her to write and direct. She wrote ''Knock-Out'' (1931) and wrote and directed ''[[Strictly Business (1931 film)|Strictly Business]]'' (1931). Both were successful movies.\n\nThe new writer/director found herself less in demand behind the camera when she returned to Hollywood. [[Columbia Pictures]] production chief [[Harry Cohn]] was complimentary of her work but unwilling to sign a female director.\n\nLogan retired from films entirely after her marriage in 1934. Just prior to this she was part of several Broadway plays like ''Merrily We Roll Along'' and ''Two Strange Women''.\n\n==Later years==\nJacqueline Logan was married three times.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=ymtZAAAAMAAJ&q=jacqueline+logan+winston&dq=jacqueline+logan+winston&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD9ZGL2-ToAhVVXM0KHUfxAHsQ6AEIGDAC</ref> Her first marriage was to Ralph James Gillespie, also referred to as Robert Gillespie,<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=9UshAQAAMAAJ&q=jacqueline+logan+gillespie&dq=jacqueline+logan+gillespie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiTwO7s1-ToAhUHCs0KHa1LCokQ6AEIFTAC</ref><ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=atwLAQAAIAAJ&q=jacqueline+logan+gillespie&dq=jacqueline+logan+gillespie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixmIS52uToAhUYHM0KHdEHCuc4ChDoATAAegQIARAC</ref> in 1925.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=82AhAQAAMAAJ&q=jacqueline+logan+gillespie&dq=jacqueline+logan+gillespie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH6e7y2OToAhVYZM0KHRi0C8EQ6AEIITAE</ref> Logan filed for divorce in 1927, claiming that Gillespie kicked her and called her dumb. \n\nFive months later, Logan eloped to [[Tijuana]] with Los Angeles broker Larry Winston. Upon learning she could face a [[bigamy]] charge if she returned to the United States, the couple lived separately until the [[interlocutory decree]] expired. Logan's divorce from Gillespie became final in March 1928, and she married Winston in June of that year.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=iMhJDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=jacqueline+logan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiaz5PT1eToAhVWXM0KHdbsDckQ6AEIEjAB#v=onepage&q=jacqueline%20logan&f=false</ref>\n\nAfter divorcing Winston in 1947, Logan resided in [[Westchester County, New York]] into the late 1960s. She spent her winters in [[Florida]] where she visited friends such as [[Lila Lee]] and [[Dorothy Dalton]], both former actresses. The remainder of the year she resided in [[Bedford Hills, New York]] with her prize Great Dane from the [[Lina Basquette]] Kennels.\n\n==Death==\nLogan, at age 78, died in [[Melbourne, Florida]] in 1983.

This has remained famous since the 1860s.\n\n==Life==\nEdward FitzGerald was born Edward Purcell at [[Bredfield House]] in [[Bredfield]], some 2 miles north of [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], Suffolk, England, in 1809. In 1818, his father, [[John Fitzgerald (1775\u20131852)|John Purcell]], assumed the name and arms of his wife's family, the FitzGeralds.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911 |inline=y |wstitle=Edward FitzGerald |volume=10 |page=443 |first=Edmund |last=Gosse |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}</ref> His elder brother [[John Purcell-Fitzgerald|John]] used the surname Purcell-Fitzgerald from 1858.<ref>{{acad|id=FTST820J|name=Fitzgerald (formerly Purcell), John}}</ref>\n\nThe family name change occurred shortly after FitzGerald's mother inherited her second fortune. She had previously inherited over half a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] from an aunt, but in 1818, her father died and left her considerably more than that. The FitzGeralds were one of the wealthiest families in England. Edward FitzGerald later commented that all of his relatives were mad; further, that he was insane as well, but was at least aware of the fact.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Catherine |last=Caufield |title=The Emperor of the United States and other magnificent British eccentrics |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1981 |isbn=0-7100-0957-7 |page=86}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, the family moved to France, and lived in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St Germain]] as well as Paris, but in 1818, after the aforementioned death of his maternal grandfather, the family had to return to England. In 1821, Edward was sent to [[King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds]]. In 1826, he went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Acad |id=FTST826E |name=Edward Fitzgerald }}</ref> He became acquainted with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[William Hepworth Thompson]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Though he had many friends who were members of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], most notably [[Alfred Tennyson]], FitzGerald himself was never offered an invitation to this famous group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1830, FitzGerald left for Paris, but in 1831 was living in a farmhouse on the [[Battle of Naseby|battlefield of Naseby]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nNeeding no employment, FitzGerald moved to his native Suffolk, where he lived quietly, never leaving the county for more than a week or two while he resided there. Until 1835, the FitzGeralds lived in [[Wherstead]], then moved until 1853 to a cottage in the grounds of [[Boulge|Boulge Hall]], near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], to which his parents had moved. In 1860, he again moved with his family to Farlingay Hall, where they stayed until in 1873. Their final move was to Woodbridge itself, where FitzGerald resided at his own house close by, called Little Grange. During most of this time, FitzGerald was preoccupied with flowers, music, and literature. Friends like Tennyson and Thackeray had surpassed him in the field of literature, and for a long time FitzGerald showed no intention of emulating their literary success. In 1851, he published his first book, ''[[Euphranor]]'', a [[Plato]]nic dialogue, born of memories of the old happy life in Cambridge. This was followed in 1852 by the publication of ''Polonius'', a collection of \"saws and modern instances,\" some of them his own, the rest borrowed from the less familiar English classics. FitzGerald began the study of [[Spanish poetry]] in 1850 at [[Elmsett]], followed by [[Persian language|Persian]] literature at the [[University of Oxford]] with Professor [[Edward Byles Cowell]] in 1853.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFitzGerald married Lucy, daughter of the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] poet [[Bernard Barton]], in Chichester on 4 November 1856, after a death-bed promise to Bernard made in 1849 to look after her. The marriage was unhappy and the couple separated after only a few months,<ref name=poem>[http://www.poemhunter.com/edward-fitzgerald/biography/ \"Edward Fitzgerald\", Poem Hunter]</ref> despite having known each other for many years, including collaborating on a book about her father's works in 1849.\n\n==Early literary work==\nIn 1853, FitzGerald issued ''Six Dramas of Calderon'', freely translated.<ref name=poem/> He then turned to [[Oriental studies]], and in 1856 published anonymously a version of the ''S\u00e1lam\u00e1n and Abs\u00e1l'' of [[Jami]] in [[John Milton|Miltonic]] verse. In March 1857, Cowell discovered a set of Persian quatrains by [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] in the [[Asiatic Society]] library, [[Calcutta]], and sent them to FitzGerald. At the time, the name with which FitzGerald has been so closely identified first occurs in his correspondence: \"[[Hafez (poet)|Hafiz]] and Omar Khayyam ring like true metal.\" On 15 January 1859, an anonymous pamphlet appeared as ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''. In the world at large and the circle of FitzGerald's close friends, the poem seems at first to have attracted no attention. The publisher allowed it to gravitate to a fourpenny or even (as he afterwards boasted) to a penny box on the bookstalls.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:FitzGerald Edward grave.jpg|right|thumb|Grave of Edward FitzGerald in [[Boulge]] churchyard<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1284168|grade=II}}</ref>]]\nHowever, it was discovered in 1861 by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] and soon after by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] and Lord Houghton. The ''Rubaiyat'' slowly became famous, but it was not until 1868 that FitzGerald was encouraged to print a second, greatly revised edition of it. He had produced in 1865 a version of the ''Agamemnon'', and two more plays from [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]]. In 1880\u20131881, he privately issued translations of the two [[Oedipus]] tragedies. His last publication was ''Readings'' in Crabbe, 1882. He left in manuscript a version of [[Attar of Nishapur]]'s ''Mantic-Uttair''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This last translation FitzGerald called \"A Bird's-Eye view of the Bird Parliament\", whittling the Persian original (some 4500 lines) down to a more manageable 1500 lines in English. Some have called this translation a virtually unknown masterpiece.<ref name=\"Briggs\">{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=A. D. P. |title=The Rubaiyat and the Bird Parliament |publisher=Everyman's Poetry |year=1998 |url= |id= |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1861 onwards, FitzGerald's greatest interest had been in the sea. In June 1863 he bought a [[yacht]], \"The Scandal\", and in 1867 he became part-owner of a herring [[lugger]], the ''Meum and Tuum'' (\"mine and thine\"). For some years up to 1871, he spent his summers \"knocking about somewhere outside of [[Lowestoft]].\" He died in his sleep in 1883 and was buried at [[Boulge]]. He was in his own words \"an idle fellow, but one whose friendships were more like loves.\" In 1885 his fame was enhanced by Tennyson's dedication of his ''Tiresias'' to FitzGerald's memory, in some reminiscent verses to \"Old Fitz.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nLittle was known of FitzGerald personally until his close friend and literary executor [[William Aldis Wright|W. Aldis Wright]], published his three-volume ''Letters and Literary Remains'' in 1889 and the ''Letters to Fanny Kemble'' in 1895. These letters reveal that FitzGerald was a witty, picturesque, and sympathetic letter writer.<ref>Joseph Sendry (1984) \"Edward FitzGerald\", in William E. Fredeman and Ira B.

Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, pp. 232, 396, 413 and 415.</ref> FitzGerald was unobtrusive personally, but in the 1890s, his distinctive individuality gradually gained a broad influence over English ''[[belles-lettres]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimes1909\"/>\n\nFitzGerald's emotional life was complex. He was extremely close to many friends, among them William Browne, who was 16 when they met. Browne's tragically early death in a horse-riding accident was a catastrophe for FitzGerald. Later, FitzGerald became close to a fisherman named Joseph Fletcher, with whom he had bought a herring boat.<ref name=poem/>\n\nFitzGerald grew disenchanted with Christianity and eventually ceased to attend church.<ref name=\"Plomer\">{{Cite book |first=William |last=Plomer |title=Electric Delights |publisher=David R.

FitzGerald reportedly told him that his decision to absent himself was the fruit of long and hard meditation. When the pastor protested, FitzGerald showed him the door and said, \"Sir, you might have conceived that a man does not come to my years of life without thinking much of these things. I believe I may say that I have reflected [on] them fully as much as yourself. You need not repeat this visit.\"<ref name=\"Plomer\"/>\n\nThe 1908 book ''Edward Fitzgerald and \"Posh\": Herring Merchants (Including letters from E. Fitzgerald to J.

This has remained famous since the 1860s.\n\n==Life==\nEdward FitzGerald was born Edward Purcell at [[Bredfield House]] in [[Bredfield]], some 2 miles north of [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], Suffolk, England, in 1809. In 1818, his father, [[John Fitzgerald (1775\u20131852)|John Purcell]], assumed the name and arms of his wife's family, the FitzGeralds.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911 |inline=y |wstitle=FitzGerald, Edward |volume=10 |page=443 |first=Edmund |last=Gosse |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}</ref> His elder brother [[John Purcell-Fitzgerald|John]] used the surname Purcell-Fitzgerald from 1858.<ref>{{acad|id=FTST820J|name=Fitzgerald (formerly Purcell), John}}</ref>\n\nThe family name change occurred shortly after FitzGerald's mother inherited her second fortune. She had previously inherited over half a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] from an aunt, but in 1818, her father died and left her considerably more than that. The FitzGeralds were one of the wealthiest families in England. Edward FitzGerald later commented that all of his relatives were mad; further, that he was insane as well, but was at least aware of the fact.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Catherine |last=Caufield |title=The Emperor of the United States and other magnificent British eccentrics |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1981 |isbn=0-7100-0957-7 |page=86}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, the family moved to France, and lived in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St Germain]] as well as Paris, but in 1818, after the aforementioned death of his maternal grandfather, the family had to return to England. In 1821, Edward was sent to [[King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds]]. In 1826, he went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Acad |id=FTST826E |name=Fitzgerald, Edward}}</ref> He became acquainted with [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[William Hepworth Thompson]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Though he had many friends who were members of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], most notably [[Alfred Tennyson]], FitzGerald himself was never offered an invitation to this famous group.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1830, FitzGerald left for Paris, but in 1831 was living in a farmhouse on the [[Battle of Naseby|battlefield of Naseby]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nNeeding no employment, FitzGerald moved to his native Suffolk, where he lived quietly, never leaving the county for more than a week or two while he resided there. Until 1835, the FitzGeralds lived in [[Wherstead]], then moved until 1853 to a cottage in the grounds of [[Boulge|Boulge Hall]], near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], to which his parents had moved. In 1860, he again moved with his family to Farlingay Hall, where they stayed until in 1873. Their final move was to Woodbridge itself, where FitzGerald resided at his own house close by, called Little Grange. During most of this time, FitzGerald was preoccupied with flowers, music, and literature. Friends like Tennyson and Thackeray had surpassed him in the field of literature, and for a long time FitzGerald showed no intention of emulating their literary success. In 1851, he published his first book, ''[[Euphranor]]'', a [[Plato]]nic dialogue, born of memories of the old happy life in Cambridge. This was followed in 1852 by the publication of ''Polonius'', a collection of \"saws and modern instances,\" some of them his own, the rest borrowed from the less familiar English classics. FitzGerald began the study of [[Spanish poetry]] in 1850 at [[Elmsett]], followed by [[Persian language|Persian]] literature at the [[University of Oxford]] with Professor [[Edward Byles Cowell]] in 1853.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFitzGerald married Lucy, daughter of the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] poet [[Bernard Barton]], in Chichester on 4 November 1856, after a death-bed promise to Bernard made in 1849 to look after her. The marriage was unhappy and the couple separated after only a few months,<ref name=poem>[http://www.poemhunter.com/edward-fitzgerald/biography/ \"Edward Fitzgerald\", Poem Hunter]</ref> despite having known each other for many years, including collaborating on a book about her father's works in 1849.\n\n==Early literary work==\nIn 1853, FitzGerald issued ''Six Dramas of Calderon'', freely translated.<ref name=poem/> He then turned to [[Oriental studies]], and in 1856 published anonymously a version of the ''S\u00e1lam\u00e1n and Abs\u00e1l'' of [[Jami]] in [[John Milton|Miltonic]] verse. In March 1857, Cowell discovered a set of Persian quatrains by [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]] in the [[Asiatic Society]] library, [[Calcutta]], and sent them to FitzGerald. At the time, the name with which FitzGerald has been so closely identified first occurs in his correspondence: \"[[Hafez (poet)|Hafiz]] and Omar Khayyam ring like true metal.\" On 15 January 1859, an anonymous pamphlet appeared as ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''. In the world at large and the circle of FitzGerald's close friends, the poem seems at first to have attracted no attention. The publisher allowed it to gravitate to a fourpenny or even (as he afterwards boasted) to a penny box on the bookstalls.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:FitzGerald Edward grave.jpg|right|thumb|Grave of Edward FitzGerald in [[Boulge]] churchyard<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1284168|grade=II}}</ref>]]\nHowever, it was discovered in 1861 by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] and soon after by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] and Lord Houghton. The ''Rubaiyat'' slowly became famous, but it was not until 1868 that FitzGerald was encouraged to print a second, greatly revised edition of it. He had produced in 1865 a version of the ''Agamemnon'', and two more plays from [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]]. In 1880\u20131881, he privately issued translations of the two [[Oedipus]] tragedies. His last publication was ''Readings'' in Crabbe, 1882. He left in manuscript a version of [[Attar of Nishapur]]'s ''Mantic-Uttair''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This last translation FitzGerald called \"A Bird's-Eye view of the Bird Parliament\", whittling the Persian original (some 4500 lines) down to a more manageable 1500 lines in English. Some have called this translation a virtually unknown masterpiece.<ref name=\"Briggs\">{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=A. D. P. |title=The Rubaiyat and the Bird Parliament |publisher=Everyman's Poetry |year=1998 |url= |id= |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1861 onwards, FitzGerald's greatest interest had been in the sea. In June 1863 he bought a [[yacht]], \"The Scandal\", and in 1867 he became part-owner of a herring [[lugger]], the ''Meum and Tuum'' (\"mine and thine\"). For some years up to 1871, he spent his summers \"knocking about somewhere outside of [[Lowestoft]].\" He died in his sleep in 1883 and was buried at [[Boulge]]. He was in his own words \"an idle fellow, but one whose friendships were more like loves.\" In 1885 his fame was enhanced by Tennyson's dedication of his ''Tiresias'' to FitzGerald's memory, in some reminiscent verses to \"Old Fitz.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nLittle was known of FitzGerald personally until his close friend and literary executor [[William Aldis Wright|W. Aldis Wright]], published his three-volume ''Letters and Literary Remains'' in 1889 and the ''Letters to Fanny Kemble'' in 1895. These letters reveal that FitzGerald was a witty, picturesque, and sympathetic letter writer.<ref>Joseph Sendry (1984) \"Edward FitzGerald\", in William E. Fredeman and Ira B.

Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, pp. 232, 396, 413 and 415.</ref> FitzGerald was unobtrusive personally, but in the 1890s, his distinctive individuality gradually gained a broad influence over English ''[[belles-lettres]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimes1909\"/>\n\nFitzGerald's emotional life was complex. He was extremely close to many friends, among them William Browne, who was 16 when they met. Browne's tragically early death in a horse-riding accident was a catastrophe for FitzGerald. Later, FitzGerald became close to a fisherman named Joseph Fletcher, with whom he had bought a herring boat.<ref name=poem/>\n\nFitzGerald grew disenchanted with Christianity and eventually ceased to attend church.<ref name=\"Plomer\">{{Cite book |first=William |last=Plomer |title=Electric Delights |publisher=David R.

FitzGerald reportedly told him that his decision to absent himself was the fruit of long and hard meditation. When the pastor protested, FitzGerald showed him the door and said, \"Sir, you might have conceived that a man does not come to my years of life without thinking much of these things. I believe I may say that I have reflected [on] them fully as much as yourself. You need not repeat this visit.\"<ref name=\"Plomer\"/>\n\nThe 1908 book ''Edward Fitzgerald and \"Posh\": Herring Merchants (Including letters from E. Fitzgerald to J.

It comprises three wards of the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation and accordingly has three major divisions, viz. Shalimar Garden (Main), Shalimar Garden Extension-I and Shalimar Garden Extension-II. Almost all the construction in the area is that of Low Rise builder apartments, with shops on the lower floors and apartments on the higher floors.\n\n== Location ==\nIt lies on the north of G.T. Road, and is bound by [[Dilshad Garden]] (Delhi) on the west and [[Rajendra Nagar, Delhi|Rajendra Nagar]], [[Sahibabad]] on the east. The Loni Road forms its northern boundary. The nearest metro station of the [[Delhi Metro]] network is [[Raj Bagh (Delhi Metro)|Raj Bagh]] which is at a distance of 1.5&nbsp;km. The nearest Bus depot is [[Seemapuri]] Depot, which is at a distance of around 2&nbsp;km. The nearest railway station is Sahibabad, which is around 4&nbsp;km. The nearest airport is the [[Indira Gandhi International]], which is 30&nbsp;km. app from here. The [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]], [[Anand Vihar]], [[New Delhi]] and [[Old Delhi]] Railway Stations are at distances of around 12&nbsp;km, 7&nbsp;km, 15&nbsp;km and 14&nbsp;km respectively.\n\n== History ==\nFrom the historical cultural, theological and archeological point of view the area is a prosperous one. This has been proved from the research work and excavations done in [[Trans-Hindon]]. The excavation carried out at the mound of Kaseri situated on the bank of the [[Hindon River]], 2&nbsp;km north of [[Mohan Nagar]] shows that civilization was developed here in 2500 BC.[1] \nDuring the reign of Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] in 1313, this entire region had become a huge battlefield.[2] Sultan Nasiruddin who was famous for his simplicity and honesty spent his childhood in the [[Loni, India|Loni]] fort nearby. The attack of [[Taimur]] came on the [[Loni, Ghaziabad|Loni]] fort and the human massacre by him are well known references of history. The importance of Loni increased during the [[Mughal period]] as the [[Mughal emperors]] used to come here for hunting and pleasure trips. A Baage Ranap is a memorial of that period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formation of the District|url=http://ghaziabad.nic.in/intr.htm|publisher=Ministry of Communications and Information Technology}}</ref>\n\nThis area also witnessed fierce battles during the [[Revolt of 1857]], as the revolting [[Sepoys]] marched into Delhi through this place and the company forces tried to stop them. Being very close to [[Shahdara]], which has been a very important centre for trade and commerce to the east of [[Yamuna]], for the last 400 years, it can be presumed that Shalimar Garden and nearby areas have ever since been very prosperous.\n\nThe modern locality of Shalimar Garden, although is very new relatively and started developing only in the late 1960s, when small labour settlements started springing up thanks to the new industrial set-ups in the [[Sahibabad#Industrial.2FCommercial|Sahibabad Industrial area]]. By the early 70's, local real estate developers, keeping in mind the locational advantage of the area, started developing the area by deforesting the remaining jungles and acquiring the farmlands from the villagers of Pasonda and Bhopura. Streets were laid, and other civic amenities like sanitation, drainage, electricity etc. were taken care of and numerous plots of varying sizes were sold off. Until, the late nineties, almost all the plots had landed in the hands of small and big builder-promoters, who promptly constructed an apartment building on every plot, thus over-burdening the infrastructure greatly. This, until the close of the last decade, caused a lot of infrastructural problems right from frequent load shedding to water-scarcity, etc. but those were teething problems every new establishment faces, and now they are beginning to get sorted out as is also the case in other neighbouring localities.\n\nAll this while, the population of the area, swelled enormously and acquired a pleasant cosmopolitan feel. Most of the new settlers were from far-off places of North, South and East India. They were generally white  or blue collar professionals working at the Industries nearby and many also in Central Delhi Offices. Most chose the locality because of its locational advantage, easy access from the central business district of Delhi, and affordability. Also, a large community of displaced [[Kashmiri Pandit|Pandits]] from the [[Kashmir Valley]] settled up here under their rehabilitation plan, starting from the early nineties.
