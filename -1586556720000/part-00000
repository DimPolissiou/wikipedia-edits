He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nBorn in West Virginia, Spaid began his career in education as a schoolteacher in Virginia and as a school administrator in Ohio. He became principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1894, and superintendent of Delaware's New Castle County Public Schools in 1903. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools, he instituted pay raises for teachers to mitigate a teacher shortage, and he served on a committee to revise the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917, and became the Delaware State Commissioner of Education that same year. As state commissioner, Spaid worked to bring efficiency to the state's public school system and led to the Delaware State Board of Education's adoption of a new school code in 1919. In 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education advocated for the observation of [[Memorial Day]] in the state's public schools. He left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nBorn in West Virginia, Spaid began his career in education as a schoolteacher in Virginia and as a school administrator in Ohio. He became principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1894, and superintendent of Delaware's New Castle County Public Schools in 1903. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools, he instituted pay raises for teachers to mitigate a teacher shortage, and he served on a committee to revise the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917, and became the Delaware State Commissioner of Education that same year. As state commissioner, Spaid worked to bring efficiency to the state's public school system and led to the Delaware State Board of Education's adoption of a new school code in 1919. In 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education advocated for the observation of [[Memorial Day]] in the state's public schools. He left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

In addition, costumes are quite uncommon and is almost exclusively unique to the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlavi]] order in Turkey - which is an official cultural \"heritage\" of the secular Turkish state. In Sufism, group dhikr does not necessarily entail all of these forms.\n\nThe most common forms of Sufi group dhikr consist in the recital of particular litanies (e.g. [https://www.mirajhealing.com/pages/hizb-bahr Hizb al-Bahr] of the Shadhilis), a composition of Quranic phrases and Prophetic supplications (e.g. [https://www.amazon.com/Prophetic-Invocations-Imam-Al-Haddad/dp/1929694105 Wird al-Latif] of the [[Ba 'Alawi tariqa|Ba `Alawis]]), or a liturgical repetition of various formula and prayers (e.g. al-Wadhifa of the [[Tijani]]s <ref>{{cite web|title=The Litany of Tijani Prayers|url=http://www.dar-sirr.com/Tijanism/litanies.html|accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>). All of these forms are referred to as a \"hizb\" (''pl.'' \"ahzab\") or a \"wird\" (''pl.'' \"awrad\"). This terminological usage is important as some critics often mistakenly believe that the word hizb only refers to a [[Juz'|portion]] of the Quran.<ref>For instance, Ahmad al-Tijani is often unfairly criticized for saying that the ''Salat al-Fatih'' which he instructed his students to recite is \"more valuable than a ''hizb''\". This \"''hizb''\" that he was referring to was not a ''hizb'' of the Quran, but a ''hizb'' of the ''[[Dala'il al-Khayrat]]'' which was so commonly recited in Tijani's time that many people recited the entire composition several times a day.</ref> In addition, many recite extended prayers upon Muhammad (known as [[durood]]) of which the [[Dala'il al-Khayrat]] is perhaps the most popular. Though common to almost all Sufi orders, some (such as the [[Naqsbandi]]s) prefer to perform their dhikr silently - even in group settings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmad|first=Zulfaqir|title=Wisdom for the Seeker|location=Concerning the Dhikr of the Naqsbandi-Mujaddid Tariqa|url=http://www.tasawwuf.org/writings/wisdom_seeker/wisdom_letter2.pdf|access-date=2011-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005050852/http://www.tasawwuf.org/writings/wisdom_seeker/wisdom_letter2.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition, most gatherings are held on Thursday or Sunday nights as part of the institutional practices of the tariqah (since Thursday is the night marks the entrance of the Muslim \"holy\" day of Friday and Sundays are a convenient congregational time in most contemporary societies) - though people who don't live near their official [[Khanqah|zawiya]] gather whenever is convenient for the most people.\n\nAnother type of group dhikr ceremony that is most commonly performed in [[Arab World|Arabic countries]] is called the [[ha\u1e0dra]] (''lit''. presence).<ref>In earlier orders, the \"presence\" referred to was that of God, but since the 18th century it has been considered to be the spiritual presence of Muhammad (John L. Esposito, \"Hadrah.\" The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.) The shifting focus, however, is not shared by all and is a result of the Sufi reforms which sought to mitigate the heretical belief of [[theopanism]] committed by some Sufi claimants through a greater focus on the spirit and active life of Muhammad instead of a metaphorical union with God.(Ira Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, p. 210)</ref> The ha\u1e0dra is a communal gathering for dhikr and its associated liturgical rituals, prayers, and song recitals, performing both in private or public. Though the ha\u1e0dra is popular (in part because of the controversy surrounding it), it is mostly practiced in North Africa, the Middle-East and Turkey. In [[Turkey]] this ceremony is called \"Zikr-i Kiyam\" (Standing dhikr) and \"imara\" in Algeria and Morocco. In places like Syria where Sufis are a visible part of the fabric and psyche of society, each order typically has their private gathering on one day and will participate in a public ha\u1e0dra at a central location to which both the affiliated and unaffiliated alike are invited as an expression of unity. Similar public ceremonies occur in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco.\n\n[[File:Dhikr hadrah articulation.PNG|thumb|Dhikr hadrah articulation, upward beams indicating inhalation and downward beams indicating exhalation <ref name=\"Touma, p.165\"/>]]\n\nFor those who perform it, the ha\u1e0dra marks the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the Sufi's gathering regardless of any teaching or [[musical form|formal]] structure - it often follows a formal teaching session as a way of internalizing the lessons. Musically, the structure of the ha\u1e0dra includes several secular [[Arabic music|Arab genres]] (each of which expresses a different emotion) and can last for hours.<ref name=\"Touma, p.165\">Touma, p.165.</ref> It is directed by the [[sheikh]] of the tariqa or one of his representatives; monitoring the intensity, depth and duration of the phases of the ha\u1e0dra, the sheikh aims to draw the circle into deep awareness of God and away from the participants own individuatedness. The dhikr ceremonies may have a ritually determined length or may last as long as the Sheikh deems his [[murid]]s require. The ha\u1e0dra section consists of the [[ostinato]]-like repetition of the name of God over which the soloist performs a richly ornamented song. In many ha\u1e0dras, this repetition proceeds from the chest and has the effect of a percussion instrument, with the participants bending forward while exhaling and stand straight while inhaling so that both the movement and sound contribute to the overall rhythm. The climax is usually reached through cries of \"Allah! Allah!\" or \"hu hu\" (which is either the pronoun \"he\" or the last vowel on the word \"Allah\" depending on the method) while the participants are moving up and down. Universally, the ha\u1e0dra is almost always followed by Quranic recital in the [[tarteel]] style - which according to [[Junayd Baghdadi|al-Junayd al-Baghdadi]], was a prophetic instruction received through a dream.\n\nMore common than the ha\u1e0dra is the [[Sema|sama]]` (''lit''. audition), a type of group ceremony that consist mostly of the audition of spiritual poetry and Quranic recitation in an emotionally charged manner; and thus is not dhikr is the technical sense the word implies. However, the same debate over certain matters of decorum apply as exists with the ha\u1e0dra. Even though group dhikr is popular and makes up the spiritual life of most Sufi adherents, other more private forms of dhikr are performed more routinely - usually consisting of the order's ''wird'' (daily litany) - which adherents usually recite privately, even if gathered together. So although group dhikr is seen as a hallmark of Sufism, the Sufis themselves practice the same private forms of worship that other Muslims practice, though usually more frequently and methodically; group dhikr is a less frequent occurrence and is not the end-all-and-be-all of Sufism, as some Sufi orders do not even perform it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tasbih of Fatimah]]\n*[[As-salamu alaykum]]\n*[[Peace be upon him]]\n*[[Salawat]]\n*[[Durood]]\n*[[Dua]]\n*[[Salat]]\n*[[Sabr (Islamic term)|Sabr]]\n*[[Adhan]]\n*[[Tashahhud]]\n*[[Japa]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book|last=Friedlander|first=Ira|title=The Whirling Dervishes|url=https://archive.org/details/whirlingdervishe00frie_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|year=1975|isbn=0-02-541540-9}}\n*[[Habib Hassan Touma|Touma, Habib Hassan]] (1996).

In addition, costumes are quite uncommon and is almost exclusively unique to the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlavi]] order in Turkey - which is an official cultural \"heritage\" of the secular Turkish state. In Sufism, group dhikr does not necessarily entail all of these forms.\n\nThe most common forms of Sufi group dhikr consist in the recital of particular litanies (e.g. [https://www.mirajhealing.com/pages/hizb-bahr Hizb al-Bahr] of the Shadhilis), a composition of Quranic phrases and Prophetic supplications (e.g. [https://www.amazon.com/Prophetic-Invocations-Imam-Al-Haddad/dp/1929694105 Wird al-Latif] of the [[Ba 'Alawi tariqa|Ba `Alawis]]), or a liturgical repetition of various formula and prayers (e.g. al-Wadhifa of the [[Tijani]]s <ref>{{cite web|title=The Litany of Tijani Prayers|url=http://www.dar-sirr.com/Tijanism/litanies.html|accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>). All of these forms are referred to as a \"hizb\" (''pl.'' \"ahzab\") or a \"wird\" (''pl.'' \"awrad\"). This terminological usage is important as some critics often mistakenly believe that the word hizb only refers to a [[Juz'|portion]] of the Quran.<ref>For instance, Ahmad al-Tijani is often unfairly criticized for saying that the ''Salat al-Fatih'' which he instructed his students to recite is \"more valuable than a ''hizb''\". This \"''hizb''\" that he was referring to was not a ''hizb'' of the Quran, but a ''hizb'' of the ''[[Dala'il al-Khayrat]]'' which was so commonly recited in Tijani's time that many people recited the entire composition several times a day.</ref> In addition, many recite extended prayers upon Muhammad (known as [[durood]]) of which the [[Dala'il al-Khayrat]] is perhaps the most popular. Though common to almost all Sufi orders, some (such as the [[Naqsbandi]]s) prefer to perform their dhikr silently - even in group settings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmad|first=Zulfaqir|title=Wisdom for the Seeker|location=Concerning the Dhikr of the Naqsbandi-Mujaddid Tariqa|url=http://www.tasawwuf.org/writings/wisdom_seeker/wisdom_letter2.pdf|access-date=2011-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005050852/http://www.tasawwuf.org/writings/wisdom_seeker/wisdom_letter2.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition, most gatherings are held on Thursday or Sunday nights as part of the institutional practices of the tariqah (since Thursday is the night marks the entrance of the Muslim \"holy\" day of Friday and Sundays are a convenient congregational time in most contemporary societies) - though people who don't live near their official [[Khanqah|zawiya]] gather whenever is convenient for the most people.\n\nAnother type of group dhikr ceremony that is most commonly performed in [[Arab World|Arabic countries]] is called the [[ha\u1e0dra]] (''lit''. presence).<ref>In earlier orders, the \"presence\" referred to was that of God, but since the 18th century it has been considered to be the spiritual presence of Muhammad (John L. Esposito, \"Hadrah.\" The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.) The shifting focus, however, is not shared by all and is a result of the Sufi reforms which sought to mitigate the heretical belief of [[theopanism]] committed by some Sufi claimants through a greater focus on the spirit and active life of Muhammad instead of a metaphorical union with God.(Ira Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, p. 210)</ref> The ha\u1e0dra is a communal gathering for dhikr and its associated liturgical rituals, prayers, and song recitals, performing both in private or public. Though the ha\u1e0dra is popular (in part because of the controversy surrounding it), it is mostly practiced in North Africa, the Middle-East and Turkey. In [[Turkey]] this ceremony is called \"Zikr-i Kiyam\" (Standing dhikr) and \"imara\" in Algeria and Morocco. In places like Syria where Sufis are a visible part of the fabric and psyche of society, each order typically has their private gathering on one day and will participate in a public ha\u1e0dra at a central location to which both the affiliated and unaffiliated alike are invited as an expression of unity. Similar public ceremonies occur in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco.\n\n[[File:Dhikr hadrah articulation.PNG|thumb|Dhikr hadrah articulation, upward beams indicating inhalation and downward beams indicating exhalation <ref name=\"Touma, p.165\"/>]]\n\nFor those who perform it, the ha\u1e0dra marks the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the Sufi's gathering regardless of any teaching or [[musical form|formal]] structure - it often follows a formal teaching session as a way of internalizing the lessons. Musically, the structure of the ha\u1e0dra includes several secular [[Arabic music|Arab genres]] (each of which expresses a different emotion) and can last for hours.<ref name=\"Touma, p.165\">Touma, p.165.</ref> It is directed by the [[sheikh]] of the tariqa or one of his representatives; monitoring the intensity, depth and duration of the phases of the ha\u1e0dra, the sheikh aims to draw the circle into deep awareness of God and away from the participants own individuatedness. The dhikr ceremonies may have a ritually determined length or may last as long as the Sheikh deems his [[murid]]s require. The ha\u1e0dra section consists of the [[ostinato]]-like repetition of the name of God over which the soloist performs a richly ornamented song. In many ha\u1e0dras, this repetition proceeds from the chest and has the effect of a percussion instrument, with the participants bending forward while exhaling and stand straight while inhaling so that both the movement and sound contribute to the overall rhythm. The climax is usually reached through cries of \"Allah! Allah!\" or \"hu hu\" (which is either the pronoun \"he\" or the last vowel on the word \"Allah\" depending on the method) while the participants are moving up and down. Universally, the ha\u1e0dra is almost always followed by Quranic recital in the [[tarteel]] style - which according to [[Junayd Baghdadi|al-Junayd al-Baghdadi]], was a prophetic instruction received through a dream.\n\nMore common than the ha\u1e0dra is the [[Sema|sama]]` (''lit''. audition), a type of group ceremony that consist mostly of the audition of spiritual poetry and Quranic recitation in an emotionally charged manner; and thus is not dhikr is the technical sense the word implies. However, the same debate over certain matters of decorum apply as exists with the ha\u1e0dra. Even though group dhikr is popular and makes up the spiritual life of most Sufi adherents, other more private forms of dhikr are performed more routinely - usually consisting of the order's ''wird'' (daily litany) - which adherents usually recite privately, even if gathered together. So although group dhikr is seen as a hallmark of Sufism, the Sufis themselves practice the same private forms of worship that other Muslims practice, though usually more frequently and methodically; group dhikr is a less frequent occurrence and is not the end-all-and-be-all of Sufism, as some Sufi orders do not even perform it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tasbih of Fatimah]]\n*[[As-salamu alaykum]]\n*[[Peace be upon him]]\n*[[Salawat]]\n*[[Durood]]\n*[[Dua]]\n*[[Salat]]\n*[[Sabr (Islamic term)|Sabr]]\n*[[Adhan]]\n*[[Tashahhud]]\n*[[Japa]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book|last=Friedlander|first=Ira|title=The Whirling Dervishes|url=https://archive.org/details/whirlingdervishe00frie_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|year=1975|isbn=0-02-541540-9}}\n*[[Habib Hassan Touma|Touma, Habib Hassan]] (1996).

It makes it possible to inoculate and grow dozens or hundreds of independent cultures of dozens of samples at the same time.  Besides being much cheaper and convenient than separate dishes, the multiwell plate is also more amenable to automated handling and inspection.\n\n==Uses==\n\n=== Microbiology ===\n[[File:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|thumb|left|A Petri dish with [[bacteria]]l colonies on an [[agar]]-based [[growth medium]]]]\n\nPetri dishes are widely used in biology to [[microbiological culture|cultivate]] microorganisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[yeast]]s, and [[mold]]s.  It is most suited for organisms that thrive on a solid or semisolid surface.  \n\nThe culture medium is often an [[agar plate]], a layer a few mm thick of [[agar]] or [[agarose]] [[hydrogel|gel]] containing whatever nutrients the organism requires (such as [[blood]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s) and other desired ingredients (such as [[staining|dyes]], [[chemical indicator|indicators]], and [[medicinal drug]]s). The agar and other ingredients are dissolved in warm water and poured into the dish and left to cool down.  Once the medium solidifies, a sample of the organism is [[Inoculation|inoculated]] (\"plated\").\n\nThe dishes are then left undisturbed for hours or days while the organism grows, possibly in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]].  They are usually covered, or placed upside-down, to lessen the risk of contamination from airborne [[spore]]s. \n\n[[Virus]] or [[phage]] cultures require that a population of bacteria be grown in the dish first, which then becomes the culture medium for the viral inoculum. \n\nWhile Petri dishes are widespread in microbiological research, smaller dishes tend to be used for large-scale studies in which growing cells in Petri dishes can be relatively expensive and labor-intensive.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gilbert, P.M. |title=Substrate elasticity regulates skeletal muscle stem cell self-renewal in culture|doi=10.1126/science.1191035 |journal=Science|volume= 329 |issue=5995|year=2010|pages=1078\u201381 |pmid=20647425 |pmc=2929271|bibcode=2010Sci...329.1078G}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Chowdhury, F.|title= Soft substrates promote homogeneous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells via downregulating cell-matrix tractions|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5|issue= 12|pages= e15655 |year=2010|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0015655|pmid=21179449|pmc=3001487\n|bibcode= 2010PLoSO...515655C}}</ref>\n\n===Contamination detection and mapping===\nPetri dishes can be used to visualize the location of contamination on surfaces, such as kitchen counters and utensils,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1078/S1438-4639(04)70035-8|pmid=11279821|title=Comparison of two sampling methods for the detection of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the environment: Moistened swabs versus Rodac plates|journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume=203|issue=3|pages=245\u201348|year=2001|last1=Lemmen|first1=Sebastian W.|last2=H\u00e4fner|first2=Helga|last3=Zolldann|first3=Dirk|last4=Amedick|first4=G\u00fcnter|last5=Lutticken|first5=R\u00fcdolf}}</ref> clothing, food preparation equipment, or animal and human skin<ref>Kasia Galazka (2015): \"[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kasiagalazka/petri-handprint Here's A Gorgeous Petri Dish Handprint Of An 8-Year-Old After He Played Outside]\".

It makes it possible to inoculate and grow dozens or hundreds of independent cultures of dozens of samples at the same time.  Besides being much cheaper and convenient than separate dishes, the multiwell plate is also more amenable to automated handling and inspection.\n\n==Uses==\n\n=== Microbiology ===\n[[File:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|thumb|left|A Petri dish with [[bacteria]]l colonies on an [[agar]]-based [[growth medium]]]]\n\nPetri dishes are widely used in biology to [[microbiological culture|cultivate]] microorganisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[yeast]]s, and [[mold]]s.  It is most suited for organisms that thrive on a solid or semisolid surface.  \n\nThe culture medium is often an [[agar plate]], a layer a few mm thick of [[agar]] or [[agarose]] [[hydrogel|gel]] containing whatever nutrients the organism requires (such as [[blood]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s) and other desired ingredients (such as [[staining|dyes]], [[chemical indicator|indicators]], and [[medicinal drug]]s). The agar and other ingredients are dissolved in warm water and poured into the dish and left to cool down.  Once the medium solidifies, a sample of the organism is [[Inoculation|inoculated]] (\"plated\").\n\nThe dishes are then left undisturbed for hours or days while the organism grows, possibly in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]].  They are usually covered, or placed upside-down, to lessen the risk of contamination from airborne [[spore]]s. \n\n[[Virus]] or [[phage]] cultures require that a population of bacteria be grown in the dish first, which then becomes the culture medium for the viral inoculum. \n\nWhile Petri dishes are widespread in microbiological research, smaller dishes tend to be used for large-scale studies in which growing cells in Petri dishes can be relatively expensive and labor-intensive.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gilbert, P.M. |title=Substrate elasticity regulates skeletal muscle stem cell self-renewal in culture|doi=10.1126/science.1191035 |journal=Science|volume= 329 |issue=5995|year=2010|pages=1078\u201381 |pmid=20647425 |pmc=2929271|bibcode=2010Sci...329.1078G}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Chowdhury, F.|title= Soft substrates promote homogeneous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells via downregulating cell-matrix tractions|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5|issue= 12|pages= e15655 |year=2010|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0015655|pmid=21179449|pmc=3001487\n|bibcode= 2010PLoSO...515655C}}</ref>\n\n===Contamination detection and mapping===\nPetri dishes can be used to visualize the location of contamination on surfaces, such as kitchen counters and utensils,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1078/S1438-4639(04)70035-8|pmid=11279821|title=Comparison of two sampling methods for the detection of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the environment: Moistened swabs versus Rodac plates|journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume=203|issue=3|pages=245\u201348|year=2001|last1=Lemmen|first1=Sebastian W.|last2=H\u00e4fner|first2=Helga|last3=Zolldann|first3=Dirk|last4=Amedick|first4=G\u00fcnter|last5=Lutticken|first5=R\u00fcdolf}}</ref> clothing, food preparation equipment, or animal and human skin<ref>Kasia Galazka (2015): \"[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kasiagalazka/petri-handprint Here's A Gorgeous Petri Dish Handprint Of An 8-Year-Old After He Played Outside]\".

Prior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] reconstitution as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Following the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its associated courts such as the [[Court of Session]] continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the Treaty of Union and was retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots property law was subject to Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n\nToday, Scots property law is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved area]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. However, large areas of Scots property law remain governed by pre-existing legal authority so its current [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]]. \n* [[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts.\n* [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n* [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]].\n* [[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\nA fundamental distinction in Scots law is made between '''heritable''' and '''moveable''' property. '''Heritable''' property includes land and buildings and structures upon it, whereas '''moveable''' property includes property which can actually be physically moved. Moveable property contains two further distinctions: '''corporeal''' moveables such as physical goods and furniture and '''incorporeal''' moveables such as intellectual property rights such as [[Patent|patents]], [[Trademark|trade marks]] and [[Copyright|copyrights]]. \n\n== Heritable Property ==\n\n===Feudal law===\nThe [[feudal]] system lingered on in Scots law on land ownership, so that a [[landowner]] as a ''[[vassal]]'' still had obligations to a ''[[feudal superior]]'' including payment of ''[[feu duty]]''.

A mailbag full of money is stolen in the process. George sees Heath in the boiler room when he runs after the murderer right after he hears Root crying after being stabbed; George, who is seen sweating nervously both during the trial and later, insists that Heath must have been the murderer, and Heath is convicted. Several years later, a lost mailbag is found and the Radcliffes receive a long-delayed letter that was in the bag. The letter, which Martha reads, contains a blackmail threat from Jeremy Gray accusing George of the crime.\n\nAs the story unfolds, clues pointing to George quickly accumulate. These include a new business he started soon after the trial, using money that he claims to have made in the stock market; his own desperate desire for success; lying to his wife in order to secretly search for Gray; the suspicious new business with an unknown man, Morris Brooke, right after the trial; and Gray's claim, when Martha finds him, that he was an eyewitness to the crime and George was the murderer.\n\nGeorge and Martha repeatedly have conversations in which she vacillates between questioning him and insisting she believes in his innocence, and he alternates between insisting that she believe in him and telling her to make up her own mind. Tension is built by the repeated appearance of George's old-style shaving razor, his insistence that Martha join him at the edge of a cliff, references to his masculine virility and his warning that Martha's investigation could threaten his business.\n\nAt the conclusion, Gray tries to kill Martha after being seen sharpening George's razor.

A mailbag full of money is stolen in the process. George sees Heath in the boiler room when he runs after the murderer right after he hears Root crying after being stabbed; George, who is seen sweating nervously both during the trial and later, insists that Heath must have been the murderer, and Heath is convicted.
