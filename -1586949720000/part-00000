[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote ''[[Tales of a Wayside Inn]]'', a book of poems published in 1863. In the book, the poem ''The Landlord's Tale'' was the source of the immortal phrase \"listen my children and you shall hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.\" [[Henry Ford]] bought the inn in 1923, restored it and donated it to a charitable foundation which continues to run it as an operating inn to this day. Ford also built a boys' school on the property, as well as a grist mill, and the Martha\u2013Mary Chapel. He brought in the Redstone Schoolhouse from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], which was reputed to be the school in [[Sarah Josepha Hale]]'s [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''.<ref>{{ cite book |last=Roulstone |first=John |author2=Mary (Sawyer) |title=The Story of Mary's Little Lamb |publisher=Mr. & Mrs. Henry Ford |location=Dearborn |year=1928 |pages=8}}</ref><ref>\"About America's Oldest Inn,\" Longfellow's Wayside Inn Web site (http://www.wayside.org/about), Retrieved July 25, 2014.</ref> However, Giuseppi Cavicchio's refusal to sell his water rights scuttled [[Henry Ford]]'s plans to build an auto parts factory at the site of Charles O. Parmenter's mill in South Sudbury.<ref name=\"Garfield\" />\n\nIn August 1925, a Sudbury farm was the scene of a riot between local members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Irish-American]] youths from the area. Five people were wounded by gunshots, and the [[Massachusetts State Police|State Police]] arrested over 100 Klansmen. [[Massachusetts]] officials cracked down on the group's meetings thereafter, and the Klan died out in the area.<ref name=\"Garfield\">{{cite book|author=Garfield, Curtis F |title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989 100 Years in the Life of a Town |publisher=Porcupine Enterprises |year=1999 |isbn=0-9621976-3-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the period after World War II, Sudbury experienced rapid growth in population and industry. Defense contractor [[Raytheon]] was a major employer, operating a large research facility in Sudbury from 1958 until 2016. Another major employer in that period was [[Sperry Rand]]. In the 1970s, the town was home to many of the engineers working in the [[minicomputer]] revolution at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in nearby Maynard. Sudbury was also one of the largest carnation-growing towns, with many greenhouse operations.\n\nFrom 1960\u20131969, Sudbury challenged and prevailed against a proposal by [[Boston Edison Company]] which would have installed overhead transmission lines through what is now [[Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge]]. Ultimately, the line was instead buried under streets to Maynard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sudbury.ma.us/historicalinfoarticles/2001/04/09/sudbury-1890-1989-100-years-in-the-life-of-a-town-chapter-21/|title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989, 100 years in the Life of a Town (Chapter 21) \u00bb Informational \u2013 Historic Articles|website=sudbury.ma.us|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\nResidentially, Sudbury's {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} zoning bylaws helped the town maintain a more rural character through the 1970s and 1980s, when developments of single-family Colonials and large Capes established it as an affluent location. Commercial growth was restricted to the town's main thoroughfare, [[U.S. Route 20|US Route 20]]. Significant tracts of open space\u2014including much wetland\u2014were preserved in the northern half of town and along the Hop Brook corridor flowing from the [[Wayside Inn Historic District]] in the southwest part of town through the King Philip Historic District (the site of a conflict in [[King Philip's War]]) and into the [[Sudbury River]] at the southeast border with Wayland. A significant portion of the [[Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge]] (opened in 2005) is located in Sudbury.\n\nThe town's [[ZIP code]] of 01776 was specially assigned in recognition of the town's historical connections to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], according to the Sudbury Historical Society. Residents of the town at the time disagree. The code was assigned without regard to historic significance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Sudbury Signpost.JPG|thumb|200px|left|An antique granite road marker along [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]] in the town's center]]\n[[File:Sudbury in 1856 from Walling's.jpg|thumb|Sudbury in 1856]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|24.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|24.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}}, or 1.06%, is water.

[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote ''[[Tales of a Wayside Inn]]'', a book of poems published in 1863. In the book, the poem ''The Landlord's Tale'' was the source of the immortal phrase \"listen my children and you shall hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.\" [[Henry Ford]] bought the inn in 1923, restored it and donated it to a charitable foundation which continues to run it as an operating inn to this day. Ford also built a boys' school on the property, as well as a grist mill, and the Martha\u2013Mary Chapel. He brought in the Redstone Schoolhouse from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], which was reputed to be the school in [[Sarah Josepha Hale]]'s [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''.<ref>{{ cite book |last=Roulstone |first=John |author2=Mary (Sawyer) |title=The Story of Mary's Little Lamb |publisher=Mr. & Mrs. Henry Ford |location=Dearborn |year=1928 |pages=8}}</ref><ref>\"About America's Oldest Inn,\" Longfellow's Wayside Inn Web site (http://www.wayside.org/about), Retrieved July 25, 2014.</ref> However, Giuseppi Cavicchio's refusal to sell his water rights scuttled [[Henry Ford]]'s plans to build an auto parts factory at the site of Charles O. Parmenter's mill in South Sudbury.<ref name=\"Garfield\" />\n\nIn August 1925, a Sudbury farm was the scene of a riot between local members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Irish-American]] youths from the area. Five people were wounded by gunshots, and the [[Massachusetts State Police|State Police]] arrested over 100 Klansmen. [[Massachusetts]] officials cracked down on the group's meetings thereafter, and the Klan died out in the area.<ref name=\"Garfield\">{{cite book|author=Garfield, Curtis F |title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989 100 Years in the Life of a Town |publisher=Porcupine Enterprises |year=1999 |isbn=0-9621976-3-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the period after World War II, Sudbury experienced rapid growth in population and industry. Defense contractor [[Raytheon]] was a major employer, operating a large research facility in Sudbury from 1958 until 2016. Another major employer in that period was [[Sperry Rand]]. In the 1970s, the town was home to many of the engineers working in the [[minicomputer]] revolution at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in nearby Maynard. Sudbury was also one of the largest carnation-growing towns, with many greenhouse operations.\n\nFrom 1960\u20131969, Sudbury challenged and prevailed against a proposal by [[Boston Edison Company]] which would have installed overhead transmission lines through what is now [[Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge]]. Ultimately, the line was instead buried under streets to Maynard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sudbury.ma.us/historicalinfoarticles/2001/04/09/sudbury-1890-1989-100-years-in-the-life-of-a-town-chapter-21/|title=Sudbury, 1890\u20131989, 100 years in the Life of a Town (Chapter 21) \u00bb Informational \u2013 Historic Articles|website=sudbury.ma.us|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\nResidentially, Sudbury's {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} zoning bylaws helped the town maintain a more rural character through the 1970s and 1980s, when developments of single-family Colonials and large Capes established it as an affluent location. Commercial growth was restricted to the town's main thoroughfare, [[U.S. Route 20|US Route 20]]. Significant tracts of open space\u2014including much wetland\u2014were preserved in the northern half of town and along the Hop Brook corridor flowing from the [[Wayside Inn Historic District]] in the southwest part of town through the King Philip Historic District (the site of a conflict in [[King Philip's War]]) and into the [[Sudbury River]] at the southeast border with Wayland. A significant portion of the [[Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge]] (opened in 2005) is located in Sudbury.\n\nThe town's [[ZIP code]] of 01776 was specially assigned in recognition of the town's historical connections to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], according to the Sudbury Historical Society.

The series aired from 2003 to 2005 on the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. It also aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States (as part of the [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/rubbadubbers/index.jhtml|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518075912/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/rubbadubbers/index.jhtml|title=Nick Jr. Parents--Play to Learn with Blue's Clues, Dora the Explorer, Little Bill and More!|archivedate=18 May 2007|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nSeven anthropomorphic, friendly British bath toys called the Rubbadubbers live a peaceful life in the bathroom of a house in the fictional town of Bathsville City. The toys belong to two children who live at the house named Benjie and Sis (however, they are never seen on-screen). Whenever the children or anyone else are not present, the Rubbadubbers come to life and begin a fun activity.\n\nBut in every episode, one of the toys become dissatisfied with the way the activity or situation goes. He/she then wishes for it to go as planned by beginning the wish with 'if only...' . Suddenly, the Rubbadubber begins dreaming about an alternate reality where the wish comes true. Some of the other Rubbadubbers appear in the dream world as well, where they play different versions of their regular selves in order to either assist or hinder the character that made the wish.\n\nIt always turns out that the wish goes wrong in the dream world, much to the character's disappointment. The character then complains again with another 'if only...', which automatically stops the dream. From the dream, the character learns to be careful with what they wish for, and then decides that instead of changing the real-world situation to their will, they should simply leave it as it was and find a way to have fun with it. All the Rubbadubbers are then happy again. Each episode ends with Reg the robot, one of the Rubbadubbers, announcing to the others that Benjie and Sis are arriving for their bath. The toys then excitedly prepare themselves for it.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Rubbadubbers ===\n*Tubb (voiced by [[John Gordon Sinclair]]) is a male Scottish rubber frog and the [[leader]] of the Rubbadubbers. He is admired by everyone for his cool attitude and enjoys cleaning anything with his [[cotton bud]] and floating on a [[green]] [[Lily Pad|lily pad]]. Tubb's catchphrase is 'swimmin'!'\n*Sploshy (voiced by [[Maria Darling]]) is a female English starfish sponge. She speaks in a childish voice, is very energetic (she is often seen cartwheeling) and is known to have a short temper. Sploshy's catchphrase is 'splish, splash, splosh!'\n*Finbar (voiced by [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]]) is a male Irish wind-up shark. He often calls himself in third-person 'the mighty, scary shark', while often playing games involving pretend hunting and scaring. He also frequently uses the word 'mighty' in place of 'very' to describe things. In the dream worlds, he usually plays roles that rival the character that made the wish (such as robbers, monsters and even his regular self). Finbar's pirate-like catchphrase is 'arr, arr, arr!' (one which he uses countless times).\n*Terence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle who resembles a crocodile. He can blow bubbles out of his nose and heavily dislikes getting splashed, often avoiding water altogether. He has a favourite, red toothbrush for cleaning his one tooth. Terence also has several spots on his back and doesn't have a catchphrase.\n*Winona (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female purple rubber baby whale. She is mute, thus she cannot speak and make 'if only' wishes, but she can make squeaking sounds in order to communicate with the Rubbadubbers. She can also squirt water from her blowhole and perform tail tricks.\n*Reg (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male toy robot and is the supporting leader of the Rubbadubbers. Just like Terence, he avoids water, as simply getting splashed makes him malfunction. He also stutters rather often. He plays with the others but is always on the lookout for Benjie and Sis' presence in order to make the Rubbadubbers prepare themselves for bath time. At the end of every episode, he announces their arrival with his catchphrase: 'Rubbadubbers! Rubbadubbers! Benjie and Sis/the children are coming! Bath time scramble!'\n*Amelia (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female English aeroplane-submarine hybrid toy. Likely named after [[Amelia Earhart]], she and the Rubbadubbers often call her 'the flying submarine'. She is very energetic (like Sploshy), is usually rather happy and loves to try new things, fly around the bathroom and perform tricks.\n\n=== Others ===\n*Lawrence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle that resembles a crocodile. He only appears in the episode 'Terence's Double Trouble' and plays Terence's almost-fully-identical friend in Terence's dream. But the only differences to him and Terence are that the tie that he wears is blue (Terence has a red one), he doesn't have a toothbrush, he has two teeth (Terence has one) and can do better tie tricks than Terence.\n*Benjie and Sis are the two owners of the Rubbadubbers that are never seen on-screen. They are two young human siblings that are presumably British. Whenever they need to use the bathroom, Reg the robot alerts the Rubbadubbers to prepare for their arrival.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2002)===\n# \"Tubb the Pirate\" \u2013 After getting scared by a pirate's hat, Tubb wishes to become a pirate so he can never be scared.

It also aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States (as part of the [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/rubbadubbers/index.jhtml|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518075912/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/rubbadubbers/index.jhtml|title=Nick Jr. Parents--Play to Learn with Blue's Clues, Dora the Explorer, Little Bill and More!|archivedate=18 May 2007|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nSeven anthropomorphic, friendly British bath toys called the Rubbadubbers live a peaceful life in the bathroom of a house in the fictional town of Bathsville City. The toys belong to two children who live at the house named Benjie and Sis (however, they are never seen on-screen). Whenever the children or anyone else are not present, the Rubbadubbers come to life and begin a fun activity.\n\nBut in every episode, one of the toys become dissatisfied with the way the activity or situation goes. He/she then wishes for it to go as planned by beginning the wish with 'if only...' . Suddenly, the Rubbadubber begins dreaming about an alternate reality where the wish comes true. Some of the other Rubbadubbers appear in the dream world as well, where they play different versions of their regular selves in order to either assist or hinder the character that made the wish.\n\nIt always turns out that the wish goes wrong in the dream world, much to the character's disappointment. The character then complains again with another 'if only...', which automatically stops the dream. From the dream, the character learns to be careful with what they wish for, and then decides that instead of changing the real-world situation to their will, they should simply leave it as it was and find a way to have fun with it. All the Rubbadubbers are then happy again. Each episode ends with Reg the robot, one of the Rubbadubbers, announcing to the others that Benjie and Sis are arriving for their bath. The toys then excitedly prepare themselves for it.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Rubbadubbers ===\n*Tubb (voiced by [[John Gordon Sinclair]]) is a male Scottish rubber frog and the [[leader]] of the Rubbadubbers. He is admired by everyone for his cool attitude and enjoys cleaning anything with his [[cotton bud]] and floating on a [[green]] [[Lily Pad|lily pad]]. Tubb's catchphrase is 'swimmin'!'\n*Sploshy (voiced by [[Maria Darling]]) is a female English starfish sponge. She speaks in a childish voice, is very energetic (she is often seen cartwheeling) and is known to have a short temper. Sploshy's catchphrase is 'splish, splash, splosh!'\n*Finbar (voiced by [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]]) is a male Irish wind-up shark. He often calls himself in third-person 'the mighty, scary shark', while often playing games involving pretend hunting and scaring. He also frequently uses the word 'mighty' in place of 'very' to describe things. In the dream worlds, he usually plays roles that rival the character that made the wish (such as robbers, monsters and even his regular self). Finbar's pirate-like catchphrase is 'arr, arr, arr!' (one which he uses countless times).\n*Terence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle who resembles a crocodile. He can blow bubbles out of his nose and heavily dislikes getting splashed, often avoiding water altogether. He has a favourite, red toothbrush for cleaning his one tooth. Terence also has several spots on his back and doesn't have a catchphrase.\n*Winona (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female purple rubber baby whale. She is mute, thus she cannot speak and make 'if only' wishes, but she can make squeaking sounds in order to communicate with the Rubbadubbers. She can also squirt water from her blowhole and perform tail tricks.\n*Reg (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male toy robot and is the supporting leader of the Rubbadubbers. Just like Terence, he avoids water, as simply getting splashed makes him malfunction. He also stutters rather often. He plays with the others but is always on the lookout for Benjie and Sis' presence in order to make the Rubbadubbers prepare themselves for bath time. At the end of every episode, he announces their arrival with his catchphrase: 'Rubbadubbers! Rubbadubbers! Benjie and Sis/the children are coming! Bath time scramble!'\n*Amelia (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female English aeroplane-submarine hybrid toy. Likely named after [[Amelia Earhart]], she and the Rubbadubbers often call her 'the flying submarine'. She is very energetic (like Sploshy), is usually rather happy and loves to try new things, fly around the bathroom and perform tricks.\n\n=== Others ===\n*Lawrence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle that resembles a crocodile. He only appears in the episode 'Terence's Double Trouble' and plays Terence's almost-fully-identical friend in Terence's dream. But the only differences to him and Terence are that the tie that he wears is blue (Terence has a red one), he doesn't have a toothbrush, he has two teeth (Terence has one) and can do better tie tricks than Terence.\n*Benjie and Sis are the two owners of the Rubbadubbers that are never seen on-screen. They are two young human siblings that are presumably British. Whenever they need to use the bathroom, Reg the robot alerts the Rubbadubbers to prepare for their arrival.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2002)===\n# \"Tubb the Pirate\" \u2013 After getting scared by a pirate's hat, Tubb wishes to become a pirate so he can never be scared.

Hargreaves, in partnership with his son (also called John Hargreaves) declined the offer and made a counter offer which was accepted by the new North Union Railway, as this was now after the merger of the railways. The son, [[John Hargreaves (early railway operator)|John Hargreaves junior]] therefore became the sole lessee over the Wigan section for goods traffic with the exception of those who already had the right to operate their own trains, mainly coal mine owners.

This railway was built by the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal|Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company]] who had in 1831 converted from a [[canal]] company. Their railway terminated at Bolton Trinity Street station and part of the enabling Act for the Preston to Bolton section made provision for the station to be converted to a through station to allow for traffic to Preston.{{sfn|Simpson|1990|pp=8-10}}\n\nIn the same way as the L&MR provided operational services to the WBR and NUR over the Parkside to Wigan section, so the MB&BR provided operational services to the NUR over the Bolton to Preston Section.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=59}}\n\nIn 1846 arrangements were being made for the line to be leased jointly to the [[Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) and the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] (M&LR) but before this happened the GJR became part of the [[London and North Western Railway]] (L&NWR), the arrangement continued however with the L&NWR and the M&LR jointly leasing the NUR.{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=97}}\n\nOn 9 July 1847 the Manchester & Leeds Railway changed its title to the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (L&Y) but the leasing arrangement continued.{{sfn|Awdry|1990|pp=90&91}} The NUR continued independently under this leasing arrangement with the L&NWR owning {{frac|60|94}} and the L&YR {{frac|34|94}}.{{sfn|Bairstow|2001|p=4}} This was the situation until 26 July 1889 when it was jointly absorbed by the [[London and North Western Railway|L&NWR]] and [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway|L&YR]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Act, 52 & 53 Victoria I, c. xcviii: An Act for conferring further Powers upon the London and North-Western Railway Company in relation to their own Undertaking and other Undertakings in which they are interested jointly with other Companies and also for conferring powers upon the North London Railway Company and other Railway Companies in relation to such other Undertakings for vesting portions of the North Union Railway in the Company and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company respectively and for other purposes|url=https://www.portcullis.parliament.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=HL%2fPO%2fPB%2f1%2f1889%2f52%2653V1n137&pos=2|website=Portcullis Parliamentary Archives catalogue|publisher=UK parliament|date=1889|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe NUR was absorbed by the two larger companies by the simple expedient of the section from Euxton to Bolton (the former B&PR) being taken by the L&YR and the section from Parkside to Euxton going to the L&NWR.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=418}}\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn 28 June 1847, the boiler of a locomotive exploded, injuring one person.{{sfn|Hewison|1983|p=30}}\n\n==Later years==\nTo cope with ever-increasing traffic, the line was quadrupled between 1889 and 1891.{{sfn|Farrell|2007|p=5}}\n\nThe stretch between Euxton Junction and Preston, which included the major part of [[Preston railway station|Preston station]], remained in joint ownership up to 1921 when the L&YR was absorbed by the L&NWR so from that date the former North Union Railway had only one owner.{{sfn|Grant|2017|pp=417-418}}{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=97}} This section of the [[West Coast Main Line]] between [[London Euston]] and [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]] had been the only part not wholly owned by the L&NWR.\n\nBalshaw Lane and Euxton station was opened by the [[London and North Western Railway|L&NWR]] on 2 September 1905, it closed on 6 October 1969.{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=26}}  Services restarted from this station now named [[Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station|Euxton Balshaw Lane]] on 15 December 1997.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Euxton Balshaw Lane is opened early|magazine=[[RAIL (magazine)|RAIL]]|issue=322|publisher=EMAP Apex Publications|date=14\u201327 January 1998|p=11|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|notes=}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Awdry-RailCo}}\n*{{citation|last=Bairstow |first=Martin |date=2001|title=Railways of Blackpool and the Fylde |publisher=Martin Bairstow Publications |isbn=1-871944-23-6}}\n*{{citation| last=Biddle| first=G.| year=1989| title=The Railways Around Preston -

A further Act of 4 July 1838 was enacted withdrawing the B&PRs powers to build beyond Chorley and instead authorised an extension to join the North Union Railway's line at [[Euxton]], north of [[Chorley]].{{sfn|Bairstow|2001|pp=3-4}}\n\nThe Bolton & Preston Act was passed with the proviso that the line north of Chorley should be delayed for three years so that a compromise could be reached between the two companies about running trains into Preston.{{sfn|Bairstow|2001|pp=3-4}} \n\nThere was immediate competition between the two companies for the Manchester to Preston traffic and they tried to undercut each other's fares. The North Union managed to maintain the upper hand in the competition as they were able to extract tolls from its rival for running trains along its Euxton to Preston stretch.{{sfn|Greville|Holt|1960}}{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}{{sfn|Bairstow|2001|p=3}} \n\nThe rivalry was short-lived as the Bolton & Preston Railway was acquired by the North Union Railway by an Act of 10 May 1844.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=417}}{{sfn|Bairstow|2001|p=4}} \n\n==Operations==\nIn 1834 the Wigan Branch Railway had offered [[John Hargreaves (carrier)|John Hargreaves]], an established carrier in the North West, the lease for operating the goods service on their line. Hargreaves, in partnership with his son (also called John Hargreaves) declined the offer and made a counter offer which was accepted by the new North Union Railway, as this was now after the merger of the railways. The son, [[John Hargreaves (early railway operator)|John Hargreaves junior]] therefore became the sole lessee over the Wigan section for goods traffic with the exception of those who already had the right to operate their own trains, mainly coal mine owners. The L&MR continued to provide all the passenger services for the line.{{sfn|Sweeney|2008|pp=13-14}}{{sfn|Reed|1996|p=18}}\n\nWhen the first section of the Bolton to Preston line opened on 4 Feb 1841 it met the [[Manchester and Bolton Railway|Manchester, Bolton and Bury Railway]] (MB&BR) coming up from Salford which had opened on 29 May 1838. This railway was built by the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal|Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company]] who had in 1831 converted from a [[canal]] company. Their railway terminated at Bolton Trinity Street station and part of the enabling Act for the Preston to Bolton section made provision for the station to be converted to a through station to allow for traffic to Preston.{{sfn|Simpson|1990|pp=8-10}}\n\nIn the same way as the L&MR provided operational services to the WBR and NUR over the Parkside to Wigan section, so the MB&BR provided operational services to the NUR over the Bolton to Preston Section.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=59}}\n\nIn 1846 arrangements were being made for the line to be leased jointly to the [[Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR) and the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] (M&LR) but before this happened the GJR became part of the [[London and North Western Railway]] (L&NWR), the arrangement continued however with the L&NWR and the M&LR jointly leasing the NUR.{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=97}}\n\nOn 9 July 1847 the Manchester & Leeds Railway changed its title to the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (L&Y) but the leasing arrangement continued.{{sfn|Awdry|1990|pp=90&91}} The NUR continued independently under this leasing arrangement with the L&NWR owning {{frac|60|94}} and the L&YR {{frac|34|94}}.{{sfn|Bairstow|2001|p=4}} This was the situation until 26 July 1889 when it was jointly absorbed by the [[London and North Western Railway|L&NWR]] and [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway|L&YR]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Act, 52 & 53 Victoria I, c. xcviii: An Act for conferring further Powers upon the London and North-Western Railway Company in relation to their own Undertaking and other Undertakings in which they are interested jointly with other Companies and also for conferring powers upon the North London Railway Company and other Railway Companies in relation to such other Undertakings for vesting portions of the North Union Railway in the Company and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company respectively and for other purposes|url=https://www.portcullis.parliament.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=HL%2fPO%2fPB%2f1%2f1889%2f52%2653V1n137&pos=2|website=Portcullis Parliamentary Archives catalogue|publisher=UK parliament|date=1889|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe NUR was absorbed by the two larger companies by the simple expedient of the section from Euxton to Bolton (the former B&PR) being taken by the L&YR and the section from Parkside to Euxton going to the L&NWR.{{sfn|Grant|2017|p=418}}\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn 28 June 1847, the boiler of a locomotive exploded, injuring one person.{{sfn|Hewison|1983|p=30}}\n\n==Later years==\nTo cope with ever-increasing traffic, the line was quadrupled between 1889 and 1891.{{sfn|Farrell|2007|p=5}}\n\nThe stretch between Euxton Junction and Preston, which included the major part of [[Preston railway station|Preston station]], remained in joint ownership up to 1921 when the L&YR was absorbed by the L&NWR so from that date the former North Union Railway had only one owner.{{sfn|Grant|2017|pp=417-418}}{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=97}} This section of the [[West Coast Main Line]] between [[London Euston]] and [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]] had been the only part not wholly owned by the L&NWR.\n\nBalshaw Lane and Euxton station was opened by the [[London and North Western Railway|L&NWR]] on 2 September 1905, it closed on 6 October 1969.{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=26}}  Services restarted from this station now named [[Euxton Balshaw Lane railway station|Euxton Balshaw Lane]] on 15 December 1997.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Euxton Balshaw Lane is opened early|magazine=[[RAIL (magazine)|RAIL]]|issue=322|publisher=EMAP Apex Publications|date=14\u201327 January 1998|p=11|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|notes=}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Awdry-RailCo}}\n*{{citation|last=Bairstow |first=Martin |date=2001|title=Railways of Blackpool and the Fylde |publisher=Martin Bairstow Publications |isbn=1-871944-23-6}}\n*{{citation| last=Biddle| first=G.| year=1989| title=The Railways Around Preston -

{"title_page": "MacBook", "text_new": "The '''MacBook''' is a brand of [[Macintosh]] [[laptop]] computers by [[Apple Inc.]] that merged the [[PowerBook]] and [[iBook]] lines during [[Apple's transition to Intel processors]]. The current lineup consists of the [[MacBook Air]] (2008\u2013present) and the [[MacBook Pro]] (2006\u2013present). A different MacBook line existed from [[MacBook (2006\u20132012)|2006 to 2012]] and [[MacBook (2015\u20132019)|2015 to 2019]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe MacBook family were initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making use of a unibody [[aluminium|aluminum]] construction first introduced with the MacBook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks. The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body.\n\nThe lids of the MacBook family are held closed by a magnet with no mechanical latch, a design element first introduced with the polycarbonate MacBook. Memory, drives, and batteries were accessible in the old MacBook lineup, though the newest compact lineup solders or glues all such components in place. All of the current MacBooks feature backlit keyboards.\n\nThe MacBook was discontinued from February 2012 until March 2015, when a new model featuring an ultraportable design and an all-metal enclosure was introduced. It was again discontinued in July 2019 following a price reduction of the 3rd generation MacBook Air and discontinuation of the 2nd generation model.\n\n==MacBook family models ==\n{{Further|Comparison of Macintosh models}}\n\n=== Current === \n==== MacBook Air ====\nThe [[MacBook Air]] is Apple's least expensive notebook computer. While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the 2006 - 2012 MacBook, lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it serve as the entry-level Macintosh portable. The 2010 to 2017 base model came with a 13-inch screen, and was Apple's thinnest notebook computer until the introduction of the MacBook in March 2015. This MacBook Air model features two USB Type-A 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port, as well as an [[SDXC]] card slot (only on the 13inch model). This model of MacBook Air did not have a Retina Display. A MacBook Air model with an 11-inch screen was available from October 2010 to October 2016. In 2017, the MacBook Air received a small refresh, with the processor speed increased to 1.8 GHz.\n\nOn October 30, 2018, the MacBook Air underwent a major design change, dropping the USB Type-A ports, [[MagSafe]], and the SD card slot in favor of two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. It was updated with a [[Retina display]] and [[Amber Lake (microarchitecture)|Intel Y-series Amber Lake]] i5 CPUs, as well as a Force Touch trackpad, a third generation butterfly mechanism keyboard, and the [[Touch ID]] sensor found in the fourth generation MacBook Pro, but without the Touch Bar. The base price was also raised, although the base configuration of the 2017 model was retained until July 9, 2019, when it was discontinued along with the Retina MacBook.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-2018-retina-display-touch-id-1199-available-nov-7/|title=Apple MacBook Air 2018 gets Retina display, Touch ID for $1,199, available Nov. 7|date=2018-10-30|work=CNET|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}</ref> The base price of this model was also dropped to $1099 ($999 for students) on the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/macbook-air-and-macbook-pro-updated-for-back-to-school-season/|title=MacBook Air and MacBook Pro updated for back-to-school season|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==== MacBook Pro ====\nThe [[MacBook Pro]] is Apple's higher end laptop available in both 13-inch and 16-inch configurations as of November 13, 2019. The current generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was introduced on October 27, 2016, which is thinner and lighter than the third generation MacBook Pro. It features a touch-sensitive OLED display strip located in place of the [[function keys]], a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated with the power button, a butterfly mechanism keyboard similar to the MacBook, and four USB-C ports that also serve as Thunderbolt 3 ports. The 13-inch model was also available in a less expensive configuration with conventional function keys and only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, but since July 2019, the base MacBook Pro model has the Touch Bar as well as quad-core processors, similar to the higher-end models, although it still has only two USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/|title=MacBook Pro|accessdate=October 27, 2016|website=Apple.com|publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2019, Apple released the 16-inch MacBook Pro, replacing the 15-inch model of the previous generation, and replacing the butterfly keyboard with a scissor mechanism keyboard (dubbed the Magic Keyboard by Apple), reverting to the old \"inverted-T\" arrow key layout, replacing the virtual [[Esc key|Escape key]] on the Touch Bar with a physical key, and replacing the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[AMD Polaris|Polaris]] and [[Radeon RX Vega series|Vega]] graphics from the 15-inch model with options from AMD's [[Radeon RX 5000 series|Navi]] graphics architecture, as well as reengineering the speakers, microphone array, and the thermal system compared to the 15-inch; the latter had thermal limitations in the 15-inch model due to its design. In addition, the 16-inch is available with up to 64 GB of DDR4 2667 MHz RAM and up to 8 TB of SSD storage. It also has a 100 Wh battery; this is the largest battery that can be easily carried onto a commercial airliner under U.S. [[Transportation Security Administration]] rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-more-100-watt-hours|title=Lithium batteries with more than 100 watt hours|date=2017-03-14|website=Transportation Security Administration|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/more_info/?hazmat=7|title=Pack Safe \u2013 Batteries, lithium|website=www.faa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-introduces-16-inch-macbook-pro-the-worlds-best-pro-notebook/|title=Apple introduces 16-inch MacBook Pro, the world\u2019s best pro notebook|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Discontinued ===\nThe original [[MacBook (2006\u20132012)|MacBook]] was a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in May 2006 that served as entry-level laptops following [[Apple's transition to Intel processors]], replacing the [[iBook]] G4.

The current lineup consists of the [[MacBook Air]] (2008\u2013present) and the [[MacBook Pro]] (2006\u2013present). A different MacBook line existed from [[MacBook (2006\u20132012)|2006 to 2012]] and [[MacBook (2015\u20132019)|2015 to 2019]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe MacBook family were initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making use of a unibody [[aluminium|aluminum]] construction first introduced with the MacBook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks. The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body.\n\nThe lids of the MacBook family are held closed by a magnet with no mechanical latch, a design element first introduced with the polycarbonate MacBook. Memory, drives, and batteries were accessible in the old MacBook lineup, though the newest compact lineup solders or glues all such components in place. All of the current MacBooks feature backlit keyboards.\n\nThe MacBook was discontinued from February 2012 until March 2015, when a new model featuring an ultraportable design and an all-metal enclosure was introduced. It was again discontinued in July 2019 following a price reduction of the 3rd generation MacBook Air and discontinuation of the 2nd generation model.\n\n==MacBook family models ==\n{{Further|Comparison of Macintosh models}}\n\n=== Current === \n==== MacBook Air ====\nThe [[MacBook Air]] is Apple's least expensive notebook computer. While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the 2006 - 2012 MacBook, lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it serve as the entry-level Macintosh portable. The 2010 to 2017 base model came with a 13-inch screen, and was Apple's thinnest notebook computer until the introduction of the MacBook in March 2015. This MacBook Air model features two USB Type-A 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port, as well as an [[SDXC]] card slot (only on the 13inch model). This model of MacBook Air did not have a Retina Display. A MacBook Air model with an 11-inch screen was available from October 2010 to October 2016. In 2017, the MacBook Air received a small refresh, with the processor speed increased to 1.8 GHz.\n\nOn October 30, 2018, the MacBook Air underwent a major design change, dropping the USB Type-A ports, [[MagSafe]], and the SD card slot in favor of two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. It was updated with a [[Retina display]] and [[Amber Lake (microarchitecture)|Intel Y-series Amber Lake]] i5 CPUs, as well as a Force Touch trackpad, a third generation butterfly mechanism keyboard, and the [[Touch ID]] sensor found in the fourth generation MacBook Pro, but without the Touch Bar. The base price was also raised, although the base configuration of the 2017 model was retained until July 9, 2019, when it was discontinued along with the Retina MacBook.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-2018-retina-display-touch-id-1199-available-nov-7/|title=Apple MacBook Air 2018 gets Retina display, Touch ID for $1,199, available Nov. 7|date=2018-10-30|work=CNET|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}</ref> The base price of this model was also dropped to $1099 ($999 for students) on the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/macbook-air-and-macbook-pro-updated-for-back-to-school-season/|title=MacBook Air and MacBook Pro updated for back-to-school season|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==== MacBook Pro ====\nThe [[MacBook Pro]] is Apple's higher end laptop available in both 13-inch and 16-inch configurations as of November 13, 2019. The current generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was introduced on October 27, 2016, which is thinner and lighter than the third generation MacBook Pro. It features a touch-sensitive OLED display strip located in place of the [[function keys]], a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated with the power button, a butterfly mechanism keyboard similar to the MacBook, and four USB-C ports that also serve as Thunderbolt 3 ports. The 13-inch model was also available in a less expensive configuration with conventional function keys and only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, but since July 2019, the base MacBook Pro model has the Touch Bar as well as quad-core processors, similar to the higher-end models, although it still has only two USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/|title=MacBook Pro|accessdate=October 27, 2016|website=Apple.com|publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2019, Apple released the 16-inch MacBook Pro, replacing the 15-inch model of the previous generation, and replacing the butterfly keyboard with a scissor mechanism keyboard (dubbed the Magic Keyboard by Apple), reverting to the old \"inverted-T\" arrow key layout, replacing the virtual [[Esc key|Escape key]] on the Touch Bar with a physical key, and replacing the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[AMD Polaris|Polaris]] and [[Radeon RX Vega series|Vega]] graphics from the 15-inch model with options from AMD's [[Radeon RX 5000 series|Navi]] graphics architecture, as well as reengineering the speakers, microphone array, and the thermal system compared to the 15-inch; the latter had thermal limitations in the 15-inch model due to its design. In addition, the 16-inch is available with up to 64 GB of DDR4 2667 MHz RAM and up to 8 TB of SSD storage. It also has a 100 Wh battery; this is the largest battery that can be easily carried onto a commercial airliner under U.S. [[Transportation Security Administration]] rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-more-100-watt-hours|title=Lithium batteries with more than 100 watt hours|date=2017-03-14|website=Transportation Security Administration|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/more_info/?hazmat=7|title=Pack Safe \u2013 Batteries, lithium|website=www.faa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-introduces-16-inch-macbook-pro-the-worlds-best-pro-notebook/|title=Apple introduces 16-inch MacBook Pro, the world\u2019s best pro notebook|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Discontinued ===\nThe original [[MacBook (2006\u20132012)|MacBook]] was a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in May 2006 that served as entry-level laptops following [[Apple's transition to Intel processors]], replacing the [[iBook]] G4.
