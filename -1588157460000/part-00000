It is delivered at [[University|universities]], [[Academy|academies]], [[college]]s, [[seminary|seminaries]], [[school of music|conservatories]], and [[institute of technology|institutes of technology]], and through certain college-level institutions, including [[vocational school]]s, trade schools, and other career colleges that award degrees. [[Tertiary education]] at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] as distinct from higher education.\n\nThe [[International Standard Classification of Education]] in 1997 initially classified all tertiary education together in [[ISCED#ISCED 1997 levels of education|1997 version]] of its schema. They were referred to as level 5 and doctoral studies at level 6. In 2011, this was refined and expanded [[ISCED#2011 version|2011 version]] of the structure. Higher education at undergraduate level, masters and doctoral level became levels 6, 7 and 8. Non-degree level [[Tertiary education]], sometimes referred to as [[further education]] or [[continuing education]] was reordered ISCED 2011 level 4, with level 5 for some higher courses.<ref>[http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf Revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)], retrieved 05-04-2012.</ref>\n\nIn the days when few pupils progressed beyond [[primary education]] or [[basic education]], the term \"higher education\" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion.{{NoteTag|For example, ''Higher Education: General and Technical'', a 1933 [[National Union of Teachers]] pamphlet by [[Lord Eustace Percy]], which is actually about secondary education and uses the two terms interchangeably.}} This is the origin of the term ''[[High school (North America)|high school]]'' for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (UK and Australia).<ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/high-school?a=british]</ref>\n\nHigher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work (e.g. in [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s), and social services activities of universities.<ref>Pucciarelli F., Kaplan Andreas M.

In the Greek world, [[Plato's Academy]], [[Lyceum (Classical)|Aristotle's Lycaeum]] and other philosophical-mathematical schools became models for other establishments, particularly in [[Alexandria]] of Egypt under the [[Ptolemies]]. In India, the city of [[Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101]], later the great Buddhist monastery of [[N\u0101land\u0101]], attracted students and professors even from distant regions.<ref>Radha Kumud Mookerji, ''Ancient Indian education: Brahmanical and Buddhist'' (2nd ed.). Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1989</ref> In China, the [[Han dynasty]] established chairs to teach the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Confucean Classics]], then in - 124 the Grand School ([[Taixue]]) to train cadres for the imperial administration.<ref>\u00c9tienne Balazs, ''La Bureaucratie c\u00e9leste (recherches sur l\u2019\u00e9conomie et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Chine traditionnelle)'', Paris, Gallimard, 1968</ref><ref>Peter Tze Ming Ng, \u00ab Paradigm Shift and the State of the Field in the Study of Christian Higher Education in China \u00bb, in ''Cahiers d\u2019Extr\u00eame-Asie'', 2001, n\u00b0 12, pp. 127-140</ref> All these higher-learning institutions became models for other schools within their sphere of cultural influence.\n\nIn 425, the Byzantine emperor [[Theodosius II]] innovated as he established the [[Pandidakterion]], with a faculty of 31 professors, to train public servants. In the 7th and 8nd centuries, \"cathedral schools\" were created in Western Europe. Meanwhile, the first Medresahs were founded in the Moslem empire \u2013\u00a0initially mere primary schools in the premises of major mosques, which gradually evolved toward secondary, later higher education. However high the intellectual level of these schools could be, it would be anachronistic to call them \"universities\". Their organization and purposes were markedly different from the corporations of students and teachers, independent from both the Church and the State, which established themselves from the 12th century in Western Europe as ''Universitas Studiorum''.\n\n<!-- Istanbul [what university??] has a better claim to being the oldest university, though it suffered name change- see comments in GBR site.-->\nThe [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fez, Morocco]] is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest existing continually operating]] higher educational institution in the world according to [[UNESCO]] and [[Guinness World Records]]<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-university Oldest University]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Medina of Fez|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> and is occasionally referred to as the oldest university by scholars.<ref>Verger, Jacques: \"Patterns\", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): ''A History of the University in Europe.

In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.\n\nIn addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although [[alternative pathways in education|alternative means]] of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.\n\n[[File:US household wealth by education.png|thumb|Mean financial wealth of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989-2010]]\n[[File:US household income by education.png|thumb|Mean income of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989-2010]]\n\nWhen employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]], [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, [[Communication studies|communication skills]] (using both text and speech), [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences. However, most employers consider the average graduate to be more or less deficient in all of these areas.<ref>{{cite press release\n|last=\n|first=\n|date= 20 January 2015\n|title= Employers Judge Recent Graduates Ill-Prepared for Today's Workplace, Endorse Broad and Project-Based Learning as Best Preparation for Career Opportunity and Long-Term Success\n|url= http://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/2015employerstudentsurveys\n|location= Washington, DC\n|publisher= Association of American Colleges and Universities\n|agency=\n|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, there are large differences in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.<ref name=\"Simkovic\" /><ref>{{cite press release| title =The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher =Georgetown University| date =May 2015| url =https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/| accessdate =17 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Liberal arts ====\n{{Main|Liberal arts college}}\n\nAcademic areas that are included within the [[liberal arts]] include [[great books]], [[history]], [[language]]s including English, [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[Music education|music]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[science]], [[environmental science]], [[sociology]] and [[Drama school|theater]].\n\n==== Engineering ====\n{{Main|Engineering college}}\n\nTeaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include [[aerospace]], [[biological]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[chemical]], [[Computer engineering|computer]], [[electrical]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]].\n\n====Performing arts====\n{{Main|Performing arts education}}\n\nThe [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].\n\nPerforming arts institutions include [[:Category:Circus schools|circus schools]], [[Dance studio|dance schools]], [[drama school]]s and [[music school]]s.\n\n====Plastic or visual arts====\n{{Main|Art education|Art school}}\n\nThe [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]].\n\nHigher educational institutions in these arts include [[film school]]s and [[List of art schools|art schools]].\n\n===Vocational===\n{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}}\n\nHigher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade schools]]. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.\n\n===Professional higher education===\nThis describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.\n\nThe intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://haphe.eurashe.eu|title = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-10-17|website = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|publisher = EURASHE|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nExamples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of [[architecture]], [[Business school|business]], [[Journalism school|journalism]], [[Law school|law]], [[Library school|library science]], [[optometry]], [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy]], [[Public policy school|public policy]], [[Medical school|human medicine]], [[Engineering education|professional engineering]], [[Podiatric medical school|podiatric medicine]], [[Dental school|scientific dentistry]], [[K-12 education]], and [[Veterinary school|veterinary medicine]].\n\n===Statistics===\nA 2014 report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] states that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men.  Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25\u201334 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55\u201364), were being educated at university.<ref name=\"ReportOECD\">{{cite news|title=Higher levels of education paying off for young, says OECD|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm |date=September 2014 |accessdate=September 11, 2014|author=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|author-link=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development }}</ref>\n\n===Recognition of studies===\nThe [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all of the Signatory Parties of the Convention.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lisbon Recognition Convention |url=https://www.coe.int/t/dg4/highereducation/recognition/lrc_EN.asp |website=coe.int |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Problems associated with higher education==\nUniversities worldwide have permitted or actively encouraged [[grade inflation]] as they compete with each other for students.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Gunn\n | first =Andrew\n | last2 =Kapade\n | first2 =Priya\n | title =The university grade inflation debate is going global\n | publisher =University World News\n | date =25 May 2018\n | url =http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180523095429859#.\n | access-date =23 June 2019\n | quote =The grading process has been compromised as universities are incentivised to meet the demands of their customers and graduate more students with top grades to boost their institutional ranking. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/grade-inflation-worldwide-trend\n | title =Is grade inflation a worldwide trend?\n | last =Baker\n | first =Simon\n | date =June 28, 2018\n | website =The World University Rankings\n | publisher =Times Higher Education\n | access-date =June 23, 2019\n | quote =Departments where enrollments were falling felt under pressure to relax their grading practices to make their courses more attractive, leading to an \u201carms race\u201d in grade inflation. }}</ref>\nAlso, the supply of graduates in many fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, which aggravates [[graduate unemployment]], [[underemployment]], [[credentialism and educational inflation]].<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Coates\n | first =Ken\n | last2 =Morrison\n | first2 =Bill\n | author2-link =\n | title =Dream Factories: Why Universities Won't Solve the Youth Jobs Crisis\n | place =Toronto\n | publisher =Dundurn Books\n | year =2016\n | pages =232\n | url =https://www.dundurn.com/books/Dream-Factories\n | isbn =9781459733770 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n | last =Brown\n | first =Phillip\n | last2 =Lauder\n | first2 =Hugh\n | last3 =Ashton\n | first3 =David\n | title =The Global Auction: The Broken Promises of Education, Jobs, and Incomes\n | publisher =Oxford University Press\n | year =2012\n | pages =208\n | url =https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-global-auction-9780199926442\n | isbn =9780199926442 }}</ref> In [[The Case Against Education]], Bryan Caplan notes that the bulk of what students learn is quickly forgotten after final examinations. It merely serves the purpose of [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]] to employers that a graduate is probably brilliant, diligent, and willing to tolerate serious boredom. To remedy this situation, he proposes a massive shift in emphasis from academic degrees to vocational training. Public spending on university education should be eliminated so that underemployment-prone degrees will become less attractive to students of average ability. The vast public funds thus saved could then be redirected to other purposes.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Caplan\n | first =Bryan\n | title =The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money\n | publisher =Princeton University Press\n | date =2018\n | pages =416\n | url =http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/i11225.pdf\n | isbn =978-0691174655}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n<!-- following is an of focus gallery of nice uni pictures, that gives no indication of the subject-just locations they use-->\nFile:Var 132.jpg|Courtyard, Al-Qarawiyyin University, Fes, Morocco\nFile:Bologna-vista02.jpg|[[University of Bologna]], located in [[Bologna, Italy]], is the oldest ''university'' created under that name in the world.<ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats Top Universities] ''World University Rankings'' Retrieved 2010-1-6</ref><ref>[http://www.eng.unibo.it/PortaleEn/University/Our+History/default.htm Our History] - Universit\u00e0 di Bologna</ref><ref>{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wyjnHZ1IIlgC&pg=PA18&dq=the+oldest+university+in+the+world+Bologna&hl=en&ei=lFy-TtitBY3RrQflnNnjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=the%20oldest%20university%20in%20the%20world%20Bologna&f=false |title = The Challenge of Bologna |author= Paul L.

In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]] and [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, fluency in speaking and writing, [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.<ref>{{cite press release|last=|first=|date=20 January 2015|title=Employers Judge Recent Graduates Ill-Prepared for Today's Workplace, Endorse Broad and Project-Based Learning as Best Preparation for Career Opportunity and Long-Term Success|url=http://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/2015employerstudentsurveys|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Association of American Colleges and Universities]]|agency=|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe oldest institutions of higher education appeared between the 5th and the 2nd centuries B.C. in several major cultural areas of Eurasia. In the Greek world, [[Plato's Academy]], [[Lyceum (Classical)|Aristotle's Lycaeum]] and other philosophical-mathematical schools became models for other establishments, particularly in [[Alexandria]] of Egypt under the [[Ptolemies]]. In India, the city of [[Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101]], later the great Buddhist monastery of [[N\u0101land\u0101]], attracted students and professors even from distant regions.<ref>Radha Kumud Mookerji, ''Ancient Indian education: Brahmanical and Buddhist'' (2nd ed.). Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1989</ref> In China, the [[Han dynasty]] established chairs to teach the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Confucean Classics]], then in - 124 the Grand School ([[Taixue]]) to train cadres for the imperial administration.<ref>\u00c9tienne Balazs, ''La Bureaucratie c\u00e9leste (recherches sur l\u2019\u00e9conomie et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Chine traditionnelle)'', Paris, Gallimard, 1968</ref><ref>Peter Tze Ming Ng, \u00ab Paradigm Shift and the State of the Field in the Study of Christian Higher Education in China \u00bb, in ''Cahiers d\u2019Extr\u00eame-Asie'', 2001, n\u00b0 12, pp. 127-140</ref> All these higher-learning institutions became models for other schools within their sphere of cultural influence.\n\nIn 425, the Byzantine emperor [[Theodosius II]] innovated as he established the [[Pandidakterion]], with a faculty of 31 professors, to train public servants. In the 7th and 8nd centuries, \"cathedral schools\" were created in Western Europe. Meanwhile, the first Medresahs were founded in the Moslem empire \u2013\u00a0initially mere primary schools in the premises of major mosques, which gradually evolved toward secondary, later higher education. However high the intellectual level of these schools could be, it would be anachronistic to call them \"universities\". Their organization and purposes were markedly different from the corporations of students and teachers, independent from both the Church and the State, which established themselves from the 12th century in Western Europe as ''Universitas Studiorum''.\n\n<!-- Istanbul [what university??] has a better claim to being the oldest university, though it suffered name change- see comments in GBR site.-->\nThe [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]] in [[Fez, Morocco]] is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest existing continually operating]] higher educational institution in the world according to [[UNESCO]] and [[Guinness World Records]]<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-university Oldest University]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Medina of Fez|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> and is occasionally referred to as the oldest university by scholars.<ref>Verger, Jacques: \"Patterns\", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): ''A History of the University in Europe.

In contrast, the vocational higher education and training that takes place at [[vocational university|vocational universities and schools]] usually concentrates on [[practice (learning method)|practical applications]], with very little theory.\n\nIn addition, [[professional]]-level education is always included within Higher Education, and usually in [[graduate school]]s since many [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] are both vocationally, professionally, and theoretically/research oriented, such as in the [[law]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], and [[veterinary medicine]]. A basic requirement for entry into these graduate-level programs is almost always a bachelor's degree, although [[alternative pathways in education|alternative means]] of obtaining entry into such programs may be available at some universities. Requirements for admission to such high-level graduate programs is extremely competitive, and admitted students are expected to perform well.\n\n[[File:US household wealth by education.png|thumb|Mean financial wealth of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989-2010]]\n[[File:US household income by education.png|thumb|Mean income of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989-2010]]\n\nWhen employers in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, they are looking for evidence of [[critical thinking]], [[analytical reasoning]] skills, [[teamwork]]ing skills, [[information literacy]], [[Ethics|ethical]] judgment, [[decision-making]] skills, [[Communication studies|communication skills]] (using both text and speech), [[problem solving]] skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences. However, most employers consider the average graduate to be more or less deficient in all of these areas.<ref>{{cite press release\n|last=\n|first=\n|date= 20 January 2015\n|title= Employers Judge Recent Graduates Ill-Prepared for Today's Workplace, Endorse Broad and Project-Based Learning as Best Preparation for Career Opportunity and Long-Term Success\n|url= http://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/2015employerstudentsurveys\n|location= Washington, DC\n|publisher= Association of American Colleges and Universities\n|agency=\n|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, there are large differences in wages and employment associated with different degrees. Medical doctors and lawyers are generally the highest paid workers, and have among the lowest unemployment rates. Among undergraduate fields of study, science, technology, engineering, math, and business generally offer the highest wages and best chances of employment, while education, communication, and liberal arts degrees generally offer lower wages and a lower likelihood of employment.<ref name=\"Simkovic\" /><ref>{{cite press release| title =The Economic Value of College Majors| publisher =Georgetown University| date =May 2015| url =https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/| accessdate =17 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Liberal arts ====\n{{Main|Liberal arts college}}\n\nAcademic areas that are included within the [[liberal arts]] include [[great books]], [[history]], [[language]]s including English, [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[Music education|music]], [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], [[science]], [[environmental science]], [[sociology]] and [[Drama school|theater]].\n\n==== Engineering ====\n{{Main|Engineering college}}\n\nTeaching engineering is teaching the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to a problem or objective. The discipline of engineering is extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include [[aerospace]], [[biological]], [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[chemical]], [[Computer engineering|computer]], [[electrical]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]], and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]].\n\n====Performing arts====\n{{Main|Performing arts education}}\n\nThe [[performing arts]] differ from the [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]], insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and presence as a medium; the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create a [[work of art]].\n\nPerforming arts institutions include [[:Category:Circus schools|circus schools]], [[Dance studio|dance schools]], [[drama school]]s and [[music school]]s.\n\n====Plastic or visual arts====\n{{Main|Art education|Art school}}\n\nThe [[plastic arts]] or [[visual arts]] are a class of [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]], that involve the use of materials, that can be moulded or modulated in some way, often in three dimensions. Examples are [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[drawing]].\n\nHigher educational institutions in these arts include [[film school]]s and [[List of art schools|art schools]].\n\n===Vocational===\n{{Main|Vocational university|Vocational school|Technical school}}\n\nHigher vocational education and training takes place at the non-university tertiary level. Such education combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as that offered by institutions of [[vocational education]], which are more colloquially known as [[vocational school|trade schools]]. Higher vocational education might be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which might concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge.\n\n===Professional higher education===\nThis describes a distinct form of higher education that offers a particularly intense integration with the world of work in all its aspects (including teaching, learning, research and governance) and at all levels of the overarching Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area. Its function is to diversify learning opportunities, enhance employability, offer qualifications and stimulate innovation, for the benefit of learners and society.\n\nThe intensity of integration with the world of work (which includes enterprise, civil society and the public sector) is manifested by a strong focus on application of learning. This approach involves combining phases of work and study, a concern for employability, cooperation with employers, the use of practice-relevant knowledge and use-inspired research.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://haphe.eurashe.eu|title = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-10-17|website = Harmonising Approaches to Professional Higher Education in Europe|publisher = EURASHE|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nExamples of providers of professional higher education may include graduate colleges of [[architecture]], [[Business school|business]], [[Journalism school|journalism]], [[Law school|law]], [[Library school|library science]], [[optometry]], [[Pharmacy school|pharmacy]], [[Public policy school|public policy]], [[Medical school|human medicine]], [[Engineering education|professional engineering]], [[Podiatric medical school|podiatric medicine]], [[Dental school|scientific dentistry]], [[K-12 education]], and [[Veterinary school|veterinary medicine]].\n\n===Statistics===\nA 2014 report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] states that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men.  Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply.

It merely serves the purpose of [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]] to employers that a graduate is probably brilliant, diligent, and willing to tolerate serious boredom. To remedy this situation, he proposes a massive shift in emphasis from academic degrees to vocational training. Public spending on university education should be eliminated so that underemployment-prone degrees will become less attractive to students of average ability. The vast public funds thus saved could then be redirected to other purposes.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Caplan\n | first =Bryan\n | title =The Case against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money\n | publisher =Princeton University Press\n | date =2018\n | pages =416\n | url =http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/i11225.pdf\n | isbn =978-0691174655}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n<!-- following is an of focus gallery of nice uni pictures, that gives no indication of the subject-just locations they use-->\nFile:Var 132.jpg|Courtyard, Al-Qarawiyyin University, Fes, Morocco\nFile:Bologna-vista02.jpg|[[University of Bologna]], located in [[Bologna, Italy]], is the oldest ''university'' created under that name in the world.<ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats Top Universities] ''World University Rankings'' Retrieved 2010-1-6</ref><ref>[http://www.eng.unibo.it/PortaleEn/University/Our+History/default.htm Our History] - Universit\u00e0 di Bologna</ref><ref>{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wyjnHZ1IIlgC&pg=PA18&dq=the+oldest+university+in+the+world+Bologna&hl=en&ei=lFy-TtitBY3RrQflnNnjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=the%20oldest%20university%20in%20the%20world%20Bologna&f=false |title = The Challenge of Bologna |author= Paul L.

The school was also in the cartoon show ''[[Totally Spies!]]'', and it was often called \"Bev High\" for short.\nThe book series ''[[The A-List (novel series)|The A-List]]'' follows a group of privileged teenagers and young adults from Beverly Hills, many of them who attend Beverly Hills High School and come from entertainment families and are known for their pro-activity.\n\nInitially, the producers of the 1990s television drama ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' wanted the show to be set at Beverly Hills High School, and the show to be filmed on Beverly's campus. The Beverly Hills school board declined both requests. So, the TV producers created the fictional \"West Beverly Hills High School\" (or \"West Beverly\") and the show was filmed at [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]]. \"West Beverly\" is a clear reference to Beverly, because Beverly's campus is located on the western border of Beverly Hills. However, the real Beverly is mentioned throughout the first three seasons of the show.\n\nThe fictional school East Beverly Hills High School was in the book series ''The Privileged Life''.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n== Enrollment controversies ==\nThe Beverly Hills Unified School District has faced controversies in student enrollment, mainly regarding diversity, and more recently, legacy enrollment (alumni preference).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-legacy16-2009may16,0,474770.story|title=Legacy enrollments offered in two top L.A.-area schools districts|first=Seema|last=Mehta|date=16 May 2009|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nFor many years Beverly has selected high-achieving students from twelve [[Los Angeles Unified School District|LAUSD]] middle schools on diversity permits in an attempt to increase the number of minorities enrolled. Selections have been made based on test scores, grades and writing samples. According to enrollment data for the 2006\u20132007 school year, however, seven out of ten students who entered the school this way were of Asian ethnicity. In April 2007, due to pressure from parents and activist [[Earl Ofari Hutchinson]], who criticized the school for not recruiting more African-American and Latino students, Superintendent Kari McVeigh agreed to extend the application deadline until April 27, as reported in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Beverly Hills Courier]]'', hoping that more students from these minority groups would seek to enroll.

In April 2007, due to pressure from parents and activist [[Earl Ofari Hutchinson]], who criticized the school for not recruiting more African-American and Latino students, Superintendent Kari McVeigh agreed to extend the application deadline until April 27, as reported in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Beverly Hills Courier]]'', hoping that more students from these minority groups would seek to enroll.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of [[Gajah Mada]] and his ''Bhayangkara'' palace guard,<ref name=Coedes/>{{rp|233}} Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.\n\nAfter Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript ''[[Babad Dalem]]'', the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself in order to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\">{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/gajah-mada-dan-kontroversi-dalang-pembunuhan-raja-majapahit-cCRR|title=Gajah Mada dan Kontroversi Dalang Pembunuhan Raja Majapahit|last=Raditya|first=Iswara |website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates.<ref>{{cite news | title = Goda Istri Orang, Raja Jayanegara Dibunuh Tabib (Bagian-2) | author = Bahari | date = 12 September 2015 | work = Sindo | language = Indonesian | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1043588/29/goda-istri-orang-raja-jayanegara-dibunuh-tabib-bagian-2-1441971107/13}}</ref> Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses \u2013 Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king's cruelty.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\"/> Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.\n\n===Golden age===\n\n====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====\n[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Parvati]] as mortuary deified portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of Majapahit, mother of [[Hayam Wuruk]].]] \nJayanegara's stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni \u2013 the most revered matriarch of the court \u2013 was supposed to take the helm.

After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350.

The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time.

Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java.

[[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities.

After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]]. The delicate balance between Demak and Daha ended when Udara, seeing an opportunity to eliminate Demak, asked for [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese]] help in Malacca, forcing Demak to attack both Malacca and Daha under [[Demak Sultanate#Adipati Yunus|Adipati Yunus]] to end this alliance.{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1= V.<ref>MB.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response.

Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest. During its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. \n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projecting its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adityawarman]], a senior minister of Majapahit depicted as Bhairava. He established the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Central Sumatra.]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\n[[File:Cast Chinese coins (330 B.C. - 1912 A.D.).jpg|thumb|right|On center bottom row (no. 8) is a Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 T\u014dng-B\u01ceo (\u6c38\u6a02\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin cast under the [[Yongle Emperor|Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 Emperor]] (\u6c38\u6a02\u5e1d) of Ming dynasty.

After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side.

Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java.

The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama.

It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit.

[[Jero Wacik]], the Indonesian Minister of Culture and Tourism stated that the [[Trowulan#The Majapahit Park|Majapahit Park]] would be built on the site and completed as early as 2009, to prevent further damage caused by home-made brick industries that developed in the surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taman Majapahit Dibangun di Trowulan |date=4 November 2008 |url=http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/04/20305699/taman.majapahit.dibangun.di.trowulan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107163612/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/04/20305699/Taman.Majapahit.Dibangun.di.Trowulan |archivedate=7 November 2008 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the project leaves a huge attention to some historians, since constructing the park's foundation in Segaran site located in south side of [[Trowulan Museum]] will inevitably damage the site itself. Ancient bricks which are historically valuable were found scattered on the site. The government then argued that the method they were applying were less destructive since digging method were used instead of drilling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Situs Majapahit Dirusak Pemerintah |date=5 January 2009 |url=http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/05100324/situs.majapahit.dirusak.pemerintah |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112012614/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/05100324/situs.majapahit.dirusak.pemerintah |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==List of rulers==\n[[File:Rajasa Dynasty.svg|thumb|right|220px |Genealogy diagram of [[Rajasa dynasty]], the royal family of Singhasari and Majapahit.

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Empire based on the island of Java from 1293 to around 1500}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Majapahit Empire\n|common_name            = Majapahit Empire\n|native_name            = \ua9a4\ua992\ua9ab\ua9b6\ua98f\ua9ab\ua997\ua9a4\ua9c0\ua9a9\ua997\ua9a5\ua9bb\ua9a0\ua9c0 {{small|([[Bahasa Jawa|Jawa]])}}<br>\u1b27\u1b44\u1b2d\u1b1a\u1b2b\u1b1a\u1b27\u1b33\u1b36\u1b22\u1b44 {{small|([[Basa Bali|Bali]])}}<br>''\u1b8a\u1b9b\u1b8f\u1b83\u1b94\u1baa\u1b99\u1b8f\u1b95\u1ba0\u1ba4\u1b92\u1baa'' {{small|([[Bahasa Sunda|Sunda]])}}\n|religion               = [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Kebatinan|Kejawen]], [[Animism]]\n|p1                     = Singhasari\n|s1                     = Demak Sultanate\n|s2                     = Bali Kingdom\n|year_start             = 1293\n|year_end               = 1527\n|date_start             = 10 November<ref name=\"NGI Trowulan\">{{cite web|title = 10 November, Hari Berdirinya Majapahit | author = Mahandis Y.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of [[Gajah Mada]] and his ''Bhayangkara'' palace guard,<ref name=Coedes/>{{rp|233}} Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.\n\nAfter Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript ''[[Babad Dalem]]'', the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself in order to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\">{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/gajah-mada-dan-kontroversi-dalang-pembunuhan-raja-majapahit-cCRR|title=Gajah Mada dan Kontroversi Dalang Pembunuhan Raja Majapahit|last=Raditya|first=Iswara |website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates.<ref>{{cite news | title = Goda Istri Orang, Raja Jayanegara Dibunuh Tabib (Bagian-2) | author = Bahari | date = 12 September 2015 | work = Sindo | language = Indonesian | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1043588/29/goda-istri-orang-raja-jayanegara-dibunuh-tabib-bagian-2-1441971107/13}}</ref> Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses \u2013 Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king's cruelty.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\"/> Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.\n\n===Golden age===\n\n====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====\n[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Parvati]] as mortuary deified portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of Majapahit, mother of [[Hayam Wuruk]].]] \nJayanegara's stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni \u2013 the most revered matriarch of the court \u2013 was supposed to take the helm.

After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350.

The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\">{{cite news | title = History of Indian Ocean shows how old rivalries can trigger rise of new forces | work = Times of India | date = 6 August 2016 | author = Sanjeev Sanyal | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/History-of-Indian-Ocean-shows-how-old-rivalries-can-trigger-rise-of-new-forces/articleshow/53577849.cms}}</ref> Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and other places in [[Indian Ocean]] coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]]. The delicate balance between Demak and Daha ended when Udara, seeing an opportunity to eliminate Demak, asked for [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese]] help in Malacca, forcing Demak to attack both Malacca and Daha under [[Demak Sultanate#Adipati Yunus|Adipati Yunus]] to end this alliance.{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1= V.<ref>MB.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades. Aristocrats are deeply influenced by Indian culture, usually armed with swords and spears, dressed in white.<ref name=\":0\">Song Lian.

In this age, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called ''Balai'' and performed boarding actions.

She wraps herself in embroidered silk, wears a necklace around her neck adorned with gold beads, and [[bracelet]]s on her wrist with ornaments of gold, silver and other precious ornaments. Family, friends and neighbours decorate a decorative boat with betel leaf, [[areca]] nut, reeds and flowers are sewn, and arrange a party to welcome the couple on such a festive occasion. When the groom arrives home, the gong and drum are sounded, they will drink wine (possibly [[arrack]] or [[tuak]]) and play music. After a few days the festivities end.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nAbout the burial rituals, the dead body was left on beach or empty land to be devoured by dogs (for lower-class), cremated, or committed into the waters (Javanese:''larung'').

Numbers of people holding shoulders creating an unbroken line while singing and chanting in unison, while the families whose houses being visited would give them copper coins or gifts. He also describes a class of artisans that draws various images on paper and give a theatrical performance. The narrator tells the story of legends, tales and romance drawn upon a screen of rolled paper.<ref name=yingyai /> This kind of performance is identified as ''[[wayang]] b\u00e9b\u00e9r'', an art of story-telling that has survived for many centuries in Java.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\"/>\n\nPortuguese diplomat [[Tom\u00e9 Pires|Tome Pires]], who visited the archipelago in 1512, recorded the culture of Java in the late Majapahit era. Pires' account tells about the lords and nobles in Java. They are described as\n\n{{block quote|...tall and handsome, lavishly adorned, and they have richly caparisoned horses. They use krises, swords, and lances of many kinds, all inlaid with gold.

The Javanese lords are so noble and exalted that there is no nation to compare with them over a wide area in these parts. They have their head shorn - half tonsured - as a mark of beauty, and they always run their hands over their hair from the forehead upwards unlike what European did.

For the writing, they had known the alphabet using ''So-li'' (Chola - Coromandel/Southern India) letters. There is no paper or pen, they use ''Chiao-chang'' (''kajang'') or palm leaf (''[[Palm-leaf manuscript#Javanese and Balinese|lontar]]''), written by scraping it with a sharp knife.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market. [[Rice]] is harvested twice a year, and its grain is small. They also harvest white [[sesame]] and [[lentil]]s, but there is no [[wheat]]. This land produces [[Sapan Wood|sapan wood]] (useful to produce red dye), [[diamond]]s, [[sandalwood]], [[incense]], ''puyang'' pepper, [[cantharides]] (green beetles used for medicine), [[steel]], [[turtle]]s, tortoise shell, strange and rare birds; such as a large [[parrot]] as big as a hen, red and green parrots, five-colored parrots, (all of them can imitate the human voice), also [[guinea fowl]], ' bird hanging upside down ', five-coloured pigeon, [[peacock]], 'betel tree bird', pearl bird, and green pigeons.

''Mang-chi-shi'' \u2013 is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. ''Lang-ch\u2019a'' is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest. During its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. \n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projecting its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adityawarman]], a senior minister of Majapahit depicted as Bhairava. He established the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Central Sumatra.]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\n[[File:Cast Chinese coins (330 B.C. - 1912 A.D.).jpg|thumb|right|On center bottom row (no. 8) is a Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 T\u014dng-B\u01ceo (\u6c38\u6a02\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin cast under the [[Yongle Emperor|Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 Emperor]] (\u6c38\u6a02\u5e1d) of Ming dynasty.

After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestige of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Acharya|first=Amitav|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=vqmMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT238&lpg=PT238&dq=Malacca+Majapahit+relations&source=bl&ots=9mQ3IaTV7Y&sig=ACfU3U1zFpmqhiUqu46YcP-omJ4q-UW_GQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj06d7m7e_oAhUbVH0KHVz_B6k4ChDoATACegQICRAr#v=onepage&q=Malacca%20Majapahit%20relations&f=false|title=Non-Western International Relations Theory: Perspectives On and Beyond Asia|last2=Buzan|first2=Barry|date=2009-12-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-17403-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]].

The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]</ref> The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffusion in the region around the year 1492.<ref name=\"JPostKris\">{{cite news|title=Kris, more than just a simple dagger |author=Tantri Yuliandini |date=18 April 2002 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 }}</ref> For example, [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342).

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit.

[[association football]] cup competition organised by [[UEFA]] since 1955. Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances, thus the list below is weighted in favour of modern players.\n\n==All-time top scorers==\n{{updated|11 March 2020}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2241732.html|title=Champions League all-time top scorers|date=10 April 2019|publisher=[[UEFA.com]]|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Champions League + European Cup - All-time Topscorers | url=http://www.worldfootball.net/alltime_goalgetter/champions-league/tore/1/ |accessdate=13 February 2018 |website=worldfootball.net}}</ref><ref>Source (unless otherwise indicated): UEFA Champions League Statistics Handbook 2018\u201319.

The etymology of the name came from ''Meru-Api''; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] combined words; ''[[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]]'' means \"mountain\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and ''api'' means \"fire\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Uitbarsting van de Merapi in 1930 TMnr 10003995.jpg|thumb|Merapi in 1930]]\nMerapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern [[Java]]. It is situated at a [[subduction]] zone, where the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] is subducting under the [[Sunda Plate]]. It is one of at most 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia and to britan.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes\" /> Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing [[lava]] emitted was [[basalt]]ic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas often generating [[lava dome]]s. Dome collapse has often generated [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and larger explosions, which have resulted in [[eruption column]]s, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.\n\nTypically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10\u201315 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the [[Hindu]] [[Kingdom of Mataram]]; however, the  evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.\n\n===2006 eruption===\nIn April 2006, increased [[seismicity]] at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation. On 19 April smoke from the crater reached a height of {{convert|400|m|ft}}, compared to {{convert|75|m|ft}} the previous day. On 23 April, after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma, some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/&articleid=269888 | title = Mail & Guardian online | publisher = mg.co.za | date = 23 April 2006 | accessdate = 27 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy early May, active lava flows had begun.

[[Seismology|Seismic]] monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]] and Merapi), and [[Plawangan]] monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into [[Kaliurang]] as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]].\n\nThe eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 [[seismograph]]s currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the [[hypocentre]]s of tremors and quakes.\n\nA zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5&nbsp;km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the [[magma chamber|magma reservoir]] which feeds the eruptions.\n\nOther measurements taken on the volcano include [[magnetism|magnetic]] measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.\n\n[[Lahar]]s (a type of [[mudflow]] of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by [[rain]] remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-[[frequency]] seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50&nbsp;mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.\n\n==Sabo Dam==\nThere are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged.

The constant smoke from its summit is said to come from two sacred armourers living under the mountain.]]\nMerapi is very important to [[Javanese people|Javanese]], especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.\n\n===Creation===\nAlthough most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.\nIt is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, [[Java]] was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by [[Batara Guru]]) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred [[keris]] at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \"fire of Rama and Permadi.\"<ref name=\"Triyoga\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit ''Kraton'' of Merapi===\nThe Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (''makhluk halus''). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]'') used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.\nBesides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of [[ancestor]]s who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (''abdi dalem''), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give [[Prophecy|prophecies]] or warnings. \"<ref name=\"Triyoga1\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=56\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits of Merapi===\nTo keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]'s coronation.<ref>{{cite book | publisher = Ministry of Culture and Tourism | title = Mount Tourism&nbsp;\u2013 Mount Merapi | year = 2008}}</ref> For [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north-south axis line between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean ([[Indian Ocean]]).

The etymology of the name came from ''Meru-Api''; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] combined words; ''[[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]]'' means \"mountain\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and ''api'' means \"fire\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Uitbarsting van de Merapi in 1930 TMnr 10003995.jpg|thumb|Merapi in 1930]]\nMerapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern [[Java]]. It is situated at a [[subduction]] zone, where the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] is subducting under the [[Sunda Plate]]. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire\u2013a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes\" /> Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing [[lava]] emitted was [[basalt]]ic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas often generating [[lava dome]]s. Dome collapse has often generated [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and larger explosions, which have resulted in [[eruption column]]s, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.\n\nTypically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10\u201315 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the [[Hindu]] [[Kingdom of Mataram]]; however, the  evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.\n\n===2006 eruption===\nIn April 2006, increased [[seismicity]] at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation.

[[Seismology|Seismic]] monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]] and Merapi), and [[Plawangan]] monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into [[Kaliurang]] as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]].\n\nThe eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 [[seismograph]]s currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the [[hypocentre]]s of tremors and quakes.\n\nA zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5&nbsp;km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the [[magma chamber|magma reservoir]] which feeds the eruptions.\n\nOther measurements taken on the volcano include [[magnetism|magnetic]] measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.\n\n[[Lahar]]s (a type of [[mudflow]] of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by [[rain]] remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-[[frequency]] seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50&nbsp;mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.\n\n==Sabo Dam==\nThere are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged.

The constant smoke from its summit is said to come from two sacred armourers living under the mountain.]]\nMerapi is very important to [[Javanese people|Javanese]], especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.\n\n===Creation===\nAlthough most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.\nIt is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, [[Java]] was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by [[Batara Guru]]) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred [[keris]] at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \"fire of Rama and Permadi.\"<ref name=\"Triyoga\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit ''Kraton'' of Merapi===\nThe Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (''makhluk halus''). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]'') used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.\nBesides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of [[ancestor]]s who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (''abdi dalem''), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give [[Prophecy|prophecies]] or warnings. \"<ref name=\"Triyoga1\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=56\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits of Merapi===\nTo keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]'s coronation.<ref>{{cite book | publisher = Ministry of Culture and Tourism | title = Mount Tourism&nbsp;\u2013 Mount Merapi | year = 2008}}</ref> For [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north-south axis line between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean ([[Indian Ocean]]).

The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter Jamie (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".

When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character.
