After a brief tutorial players arrive in a central area called the 'Hub'. In this area players can access Portals which act as access points to different in-game worlds each one tailored for a specific stage of progression. Each portal requires a minimum Power Rank to enter which gets higher per portal, allowing for progression from easier worlds to harder worlds as the player gains in level. Each world gets progressively harder but rewards higher levels of experience and better loot/resources. Each portal is of a specific color which is designed to indicate the quality of the 'loot' which can be most commonly located there, although there is a small chance that loot of a higher quality will be found. The exception to this is the higher level Red portals which predominantly drop Legendary (orange) quality loot but have a higher chance to drop loot of relic (red), resplendent (rainbow) or shadow (dark purple) quality as well. Higher Level Red portals have a better chance for to drop the rarer loot types.\n\nLoot Quality progresses from (lowest to highest) Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Relic, Resplendent, Shadow level 1-5, Radiant, Stellar and crystal \n\nIn ''Trove'' only three of the equipable slot items can be obtained from defeating hostile [[Non-player character|NPC]]s,  unlike in other [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] games. The items which can be obtained in this way are the hat, weapon and mask slot items. These items form the 'loot drops' left behind either when some enemies are defeated or when a reward chest is opened following the defeat of a boss type NPC.\n\nPlayers can obtain the other equipable items from crafting, the ingame store, trade NPCs, reaching certain levels of Mastery, or via ingame badges. These items include rings, alternative character costumes (which unlock as your character increases in level), tomes, allies (permanent pets that boost the player character's stats), wings, mounts, boats, sails, flasks (which are consumed to restore the player character's health), fishing rods, mag riders ( a form of quick travel mount limited to use on train-like mono-rails),  and Emblems, which add to or alter the benefits provided by Flasks.\n\nA notable feature of \"Trove\" is the Collection. With the exception of Rings, Hats, weapons and masks, each of the other none loot drop items, once activated is added to the players library of unlocked items. Any character on that account can then access their own copy of that item from the collection and can select it from the corresponding item slot in their character equipment screen. For example, once you obtain a fishing rod on one character, you can activate it (default left mouse click) which will add the rod to your library. You then only have to select the fishing rod slot on the character screen to be taken to the fishing rod area of the library. Select the rod from the list and the item will be equipped. This can be done on any character on that account without restriction.\n\nRings, masks, hats and weapons are not added to the library and so the player will only get one instance of the item unless more are found/crafted. If a player wishes to transfer the item between characters then they must first un-equip the item and change characters in order to equip it to the newly selected character.\n\nPlayers can trade items in the market for flux (in game currency)\n\n==Character customization==\n\nAny Weapon, Hat or mask that is placed in the craft station known as the Loot collector, will be destroyed but the style of that item will be added to the players library allowing the player to choose to use that items image as a vanity, instead of the item currently equipped. This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally any item which is destroyed in the loot collector also provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting.\n\nPlayers can also alter their characters' face, skin and hair styles using The Barbershop without limit, penalty or cost, which can be crafted or found at the Hub zone.\n\n==Environments==\n\nThe Hub zone is the central Zone in Trove and acts as a meeting place for all players as well as a way of accessing the lower level worlds until players are able to craft their own world portals.\n\nThe Hub also includes a selection of crafting stations and an NPC who sells items used for fishing, an in game semi-profession, and sailing.\n\nEach world zone contains various biomes that focus on a specific theme. These include Neon City, a world with structures designed to resemble a fictionalised image of the insides of a computer, Highlands, designed to resemble fields and forests, The Fae Forest, a dark fairy tale like zone and many, many others. (Dragonfire Peaks, Candoria, Treasure Isles, etc.)\n\nEach biome is connected seamlessly to each other and each world zone is open world in its construction allowing players to travel from biome to biome seamlessly within each world zone.\n\nThe biomes themselves each have their own unique NPC enemies which will attack the player if they get too close, as well as their own unique flora. One of the main features of each biome is their themed dungeons. For example, the Candoria biome, a theme based on sweets, chocolate and other such items can have dungeons shaped like giant cakes, gumball machines or a myriad of other themed objects related to the biome.\n\n==Classes==\n\nThere are numerous classes within ''Trove''. Currently, these are the Vanguardian, the Dino Tamer, the Chloromancer, the Revenant, Lunar Lancer, Tomb Raiser, Boomeranger, Pirate Captain, Shadow Hunter, Ice Sage, Candy Barbarian, Neon Ninja, Dracolyte, Fae Trickster, Gunslinger, and the Knight.<ref name=Classes>{{cite web|title=Classes|url=http://www.trionworlds.com/trove/game/classes/|website=Trionworlds.com|publisher=Trion Worlds, inc.|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> Each Character has their own strengths and weaknesses making the play style for each varied.\n\nMost classes are designed to resemble a particular Biome whilst others are said to be 'roamer' classes which do not originate from any particular biome, according to in game lore.<ref name=\"Classes and Biomes\">{{cite web|title=Is each class associated with a specific biome?|url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/304050/discussions/0/537402115096280651/|website=Steamcommunity.com|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nEach Character has a selection of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have built in cooldowns, limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges at any one time and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat.<ref name=Classes/>\n\n==Professions==\nThere are three Crafting professions, each with their own particular crafting stations. With each craft the level of the profession increases which in turn allows the player access to higher quality recipes for each increase of 50 levels, until the profession level reaches the maximum of 250.<ref name=Professions>{{cite web|title=Trove Professions Guide|url=http://www.trovehq.com/how-to-play/trove-professions-guide/|website=Trovehq.com|publisher=Trove HQ|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nPlayers can also participate in Fishing, which can provide them with resources, items and trophies<ref name=fishingtrophy>{{cite web|title=Trophy Fish Make a Splah in Trove|url=http://www.trionworlds.com/trove/2015/08/11/trophy-fish-make-a-splash-in-trove/|website=Trionworlds.com|publisher=Trion Worlds, inc.|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> that are not obtainable via other means. However Fishing does not improve with levels and does not require a crafting station, unless the player is attempting to create more advanced fishing rods than the basic type purchasable from the Hub NPC, Saltwater Sam.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games]]\n[[Category:2015 video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n|title = Trove\n|image = Trove video game logo.png\n|image_size = 301px\n|caption =\n|publisher = Trion Worlds\n|platforms = [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/gamescom-trion-unveils-major-updates-rift-archeage-trove-defiance/|title=Gamescom: Trion Unveils Major Updates for Rift, ArcheAge, Trove, and Defiance - MMOGames.com|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref> [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]]\n|released = '''Windows'''{{vgrelease|WW|July 9, 2015}}'''PlayStation 4'''{{vgrelease|WW|December 13, 2016<ref name=\"trionworlds.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trionworlds.com/trove/2016/12/12/trove-beta-hits-the-playstation4-and-xbox-one-on-december-13th/|title=Trove Beta Hits the PlayStation\u00ae4 and Xbox One\u2122 on December 13th! - Trove|website=www.trionworlds.com|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref>}}'''Xbox One'''{{vgrelease|WW|December 13, 2016<ref name=\"trionworlds.com\"/>}}\n|modes = [[Multiplayer]]\n|designer = \n|composer = \n}}\n\n'''''Trove''''' is a [[voxel]]-based [[sandbox game]] developed and published by [[Trion Worlds]].

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below.

A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.\n|}\n\n===Matrix mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\"/>) \n{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}\nIn matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|\u00c2}} and {{mvar|B\u0302}},  one defines their commutator as\n:<math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=\\hat{A}\\hat{B}-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}.</math>\nIn the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]=i \\hbar.</math>\n\nThe physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. By definition, this means that <math>\\hat{x}|\\psi\\rangle = x_0 |\\psi\\rangle.</math> Applying the commutator to <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> yields\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x}\\hat{p}-\\hat{p}\\hat{x}) | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u00ce}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].\n\nSuppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''<sub>0</sub>}}. If this were true, then  one could write\n:<math>(\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (x_0 \\hat{I} - x_0 \\hat{I})  p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle=0.</math>\nOn the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle=i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle \\ne 0.</math>\nThis implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.\n\nWhen a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  \n:<math>\\sigma_x=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{x}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{x}\\rangle^2}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_p=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{p}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{p}\\rangle^2}.</math>\n\nAs in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.\n\n==Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger uncertainty relations==\nThe most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.<ref name=\"Robertson1929\">{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The definition of <math>\\hat{A}</math> depends on our choice to have <math>\\theta</math> range from 0 to <math>2\\pi</math>. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, <math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=i\\hbar</math>.<ref>More precisely, <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi=i\\hbar\\psi</math> whenever both <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi</math> and <math>\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi</math> are defined, and the space of such <math>\\psi</math> is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space.

These states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Also the operator <math>\\hat{A}</math> is bounded, since <math>\\theta</math> ranges over a bounded interval.

A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"70%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution\n|-\n|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.

The basic result, which follows from \"Benedicks's theorem\", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)\u2014see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]].

In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time\u2013frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.\n\nAs a result, in order to analyze signals where the transients are important, the [[Wavelet Transform|wavelet transform]] is often used instead of the Fourier.\n\n===DFT-Uncertainty principle===\nThere is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).<ref name=\"Donoho\">{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906\u2013931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{ x_n } \\right \\} := x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{N-1}</math> be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{X_k} \\right \\} := X_0, X_1, \\ldots, X_{N-1},</math> its [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\nDenote by <math>\\|x\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence <math>x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{N-1}</math> and by <math>\\|X\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence <math>X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{N-1}</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron.

If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.\n\nThe combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W.

According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.

In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:\n<blockquote>[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory.

It was based on a libretto by  [[Angelo Anelli]] for [[Stefano Pavesi]]'s opera ''[[Ser Marcantonio]]'' written in 1810<ref>Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244</ref> but, on the published libretto, the author appears as \"M.A.\"\n\nDonizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century,<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 174</ref> but as [[Herbert Weinstock]] establishes, it was largely Ruffini's work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, \"Donizetti or [his assistant] Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini's name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi's initials as to a pseudonym\".<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 363</ref>\n\nThe opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien]] at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris with great success<ref>Donizetti 1870; Chouquet 1889, p. 238. (Chouquet mistakenly gives 4 January as the date of the premiere)</ref> and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century ''opera buffa'' tradition and, in fact, marking its ending.\n\n==Composition history==\n{{multiple image\n | align=left\n | width1 = 200\n | image1 = Engraved portrait of opera singer Giulia Grisi, dressed to perform \"Norma\" (1844).jpg\n | caption1 = Giulia Grisi, 1844\n | width2= 172\n | image2 = Antonio Tamburini II Litho.jpg\n | caption2 = Antonio Tamburini\n }}\nDonizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by [[Jules Janin]], the newly appointed director of the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien'', that he might compose a new opera for that house.<ref name=WEIN88-90>Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013190</ref>  Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new ''opera buffa'' tailored to the talents of some major singers including [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Antonio Tamburini]], and [[Luigi Lablache]].<ref name=WEIN88-90/>\n\n{{anchor|Accursi}} At around the same time in September, the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 librettist [[Giovanni Ruffini]], who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as \"Donizetti's Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent\" <ref name=WEIN88>Weinstock 1963, p. 188</ref>) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi's suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need \"a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don't know what.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89>Ruffini to his mother, 5 October; 11 October; and date unknown, in Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013189</ref>  In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: \"I've been eating up the paper, as they say.  It's not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that \"my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don't, so to say, recognize it as mine\".<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by [[Casa Ricordi]] as by \"M.A.\", since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\nIn the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. Pasquale is recognizable as the blustery [[Pantalone]], Ernesto as the lovesick [[Pierrot]], Malatesta as the scheming [[Scapino]], and Norina as a wily [[Columbina]]. The false ''Notary'' echoes a long line of false officials as operatic devices.\n\nWith rehearsals in progress in December 1842, it appeared that there was general pessimism as to its success: \"the atmosphere during rehearsals was frigid\" states Weinstock and records the lack of interest from the management and the orchestra musicians. \"The work had been condemned, judged\", he concludes.<ref name=WEIN194>Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>  However, during the evening of the final dress rehearsal, Donizetti added a new piece which he had already written for the tenor, ''Com'\u00e8 gentil'', which was designed for the third act. As for fears for the opera's success, the composer had none: \"Have no fear for me...My work will be a success\", he stated.<ref>Donizetti to Escudier, in Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\nAt its premiere ''Don Pasquale'' was performed by four of the most celebrated singers of the day<ref>Harewood & Peattie 1997, p. 211; Ashbrook 1992, p. 1224.</ref> and was an immediate success.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 194; Ashbrook 1982, p. 175.</ref><ref>Reviews of the premiere: ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/revueetgazettemu1843pari#page/11/mode/1up vol 10, no. 2 (8 january 1843)] (in French); ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5621446p/f1.image vol. 10, no. 6 (8 January 1843)] (in French).</ref> It was recognized at the time as Donizetti's comic masterpiece<ref>Budden 1992, p. 1211; Harewood & Peattie 1997, p. 211; Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244\u2013245.</ref> and, to this day, is still considered as such.

Malatesta, confronted with Pasquale's impatience, mutters that he is a buffoon, but proceeds to describe the attributes of the bride-to-be (''Bella siccome un angelo'' \u2013 \"Beautiful like an angel\").  Honest, modest and sweet \u2013 when pressed, Malatesta reveals she is in fact his sister.  Overcome with joy, Pasquale demands to meet her at once, and sends Malatesta to fetch her, before singing of the love that has gripped him (''Ah, un foco insolito'' \u2013 \"A sudden fire\").\n\nErnesto comes back and pleads with the Don to consult with his friend Malatesta \u2013 when he hears that Malatesta supposedly supports Pasquale, he is amazed at this apparent betrayal (''Mi fa il destino mendico'' \u2013 \"Fate has made a beggar of me\").  Ernesto determines to elope and writes to tell Norina that all is lost.\n\n''Scenes 4\u20135: An apartment in the home of Norina''\n\nNorina sits alone, reading a book.  She recites a passage, before laughing at the situation described and reflecting on her own temperament (''So anch'io la virt\u00f9 magica'' \u2013 \"I too know your magical virtues\").  She is in cahoots with Dr. Malatesta and impatiently waits for him to come and explain his plan at which he had only hinted.  A servant delivers the letter from Ernesto, which she quickly reads and is instantly dismayed.\n\nMalatesta arrives to explain the stratagem, but Norina cuts him off and hands him the letter, which he reads aloud: Ernesto has announced his intention to leave Rome, and Europe altogether.  Malatesta reassures her, saying that he has adapted his plan: Norina shall play the part of Malatesta's sister.  Having arranged for his cousin to act as a notary, they will easily deceive the Don.  Norina consents to play her part in the deception, and they discuss her strategies in a lively duet (''Pronta son; purch'io non manchi'' \u2013 \"I am ready; if I do not miss\").\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Son tradito, calpestato (Don Pasquale).webm|thumb|Act II finale, \"Son tradito\", at the [[Liceu]] in 2015.  Cast: \nLorenzo Regazzo (Don Pasquale), Valentina Nafornita (Norina), Juan Francisco Gatell (Ernesto), [[Mariusz Kwiecien]] (Dottor Malatesta)]]\n''A salon in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nErnesto is alone: lamenting his fate, he considers his decision to leave Rome (''Cercher\u00f2 lontana terra'' \u2013 \"I shall seek a distant land\").  He leaves the room just as Pasquale enters, dressed in his outdated finery, along with his servants, to whom he gives instructions to admit Malatesta on his arrival.  He parades around in his grand costume, hoping it will conceal his advancing years.\n\nMalatesta arrives with Norina in tow, and introduces her to Pasquale as his sister, Sofronia, fresh out of the convent.  Pasquale is smitten, and Norina plays the part of a dutiful, modest and submissive lady, to Pasquale's satisfaction.  Norina consents to the proposed marriage, which delights Pasquale.  He wants to send for the notary to conduct the ceremony straight away \u2013 conveniently, Malatesta has brought one along, who waits in the antechamber.\n\nMalatesta fetches the supposed notary, as servants arrange a table.  Taking his seat, the \"notary\" writes out a marriage contract as dictated by Malatesta and Pasquale (''Fra da una parta'' \u2013 \"Between, on one hand\"), where the Don bequeaths all his estate to be administrated by Sofronia.  The contract is quickly drawn up: Pasquale signs but, before Norina can affix her signature, Ernesto bursts in.  Intending to say a final farewell, he is amazed to see Norina about to marry Pasquale.  However, Malatesta persuades him not to say anything (''Figliol non mi far scene'' \u2013 \"Son, don't make a scene\"), and he is forced to act as the final witness much to Don Pasquale's delight.\n\nAs soon as the contract is signed, Norina abandons her pretence of docility, and refuses Pasquale's embrace.  She announces her intention to teach ''him'' manners, and to have Ernesto as a gallant to accompany her on evening strolls.  Pasquale is horrified at this transformation, while Malatesta and Ernesto can barely conceal their amusement (''\u00c8 rimasto l\u00e0 impietrato'' \u2013 \"He stands there, petrified\").  Summoning the household staff, Norina recites a long list of demands \u2013 more servants (young and handsome at that), carriages and horses, furniture \u2013 and instructs them to spare no expense doubling all their wages.  Pasquale is stricken at his misfortune, so Malatesta urges him to go to bed.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Engraving premiere Don Pasquale at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien 1843 - La Fenice 2002 programma di sala p88.jpg|thumb|Staging of ''Don Pasquale'' at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris (1843)]]\n''Scenes 1\u20135: A room in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nPasquale sits in a room, surrounded by piles of newly purchased jewels, dresses and the like, as the servants bustle in and out of Norina's apartment (''I diamanti presto presto'' \u2013 \"The diamonds, quickly, quickly\").  Dismayed by the piles of bills and invoices, the Don summons the courage to confront his tyrannical new wife.  Norina emerges, dressed to go out.  He attempts to reason with her, but she pays little heed (''Signorina, in tanta fretta'' \u2013 \"Madam, where are you off to in such a hurry\").  He suggests that if she leaves, he may not allow her to return, an idea that she meets with patronising insincerity (''Via, caro sposino'' \u2013 \"There, there, dear little husband\") but the discussion ends in her slapping him.  As she exits, she drops a note which Pasquale picks up and reads.  The note is addressed to Sofronia, arranging a meeting in the garden with its unnamed, admiring author.  Pasquale calls for a servant to summon Malatesta, before leaving the room.\n\nThe servants return and, amongst themselves, at once complain at the amount of work they are being made to do, and reveal how much they are enjoying the farcical drama developing between Pasquale and his new wife (''Che interminabile andirivieni!'' \u2013 \"Such endless coming and going!\").  At the approach of Malatesta and Ernesto, however, they exit, assured of more entertainment to come.  Malatesta reminds Ernesto of the finer points of their plan, and the latter leaves.  The doctor moves forward to greet Don Pasquale, who tells him of Norina's intended assignation, and his own plan to expose her unfaithfulness before a magistrate.  Malatesta persuades him to moderate his plan and Pasquale, believing him an ally, consents to his conditions, while plotting his revenge on Norina (''Aspetta, aspetta, cara sposina'' \u2013 \"Wait, wait, dear little wife\").\n\n''Scenes 6\u20137: The garden, adjoining Pasquale's house''\n\nIn the garden, as night draws in, Ernesto sings of his love for Norina, as he waits for her arrival (''Com'\u00e8 gentil'' \u2013 \"How lovely\").  At last, Norina emerges, and they express their love: (''Tornami a dir che m'ami'' \u2013 \"Tell me once more that you love me\").  Don Pasquale and Malatesta have observed and, as they reveal themselves, Ernesto covers himself with a cloak and runs to the house.  Pasquale tries to confront Norina \u2013 he has caught her ''in flagrante'' \u2013 but this only provokes a fight that leaves the Don spluttering.  She refuses to leave at his demand, so Malatesta, as per his agreement with Pasquale, takes over.  Pretending to negotiate with Norina/Sofronia, he tells Pasquale that the only way to make her leave will be to allow Ernesto to marry his beloved, whom \"Sofronia\" apparently despises.  Pasquale consents, and calls out to the house, from which Ernesto and the servants emerge.  He instructs Ernesto to send for his would-be bride, but Malatesta reveals that Norina is in fact the woman Pasquale thinks he married, while the real Sofronia remains in a convent.  All are reconciled, and the moral of the story \u2013 not to marry in old age \u2013 is revealed in a playful quartet (''La moral di tutto questo'' \u2013 \"The moral of all this\").\n\n==Recordings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Cast<br/>(Don Pasquale,<br>Norina,<br>Malatesta,<br>Ernesto)\n!Conductor,<br/>Opera house and orchestra\n!Label<ref>[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLDODONP.HTM Source of recording on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk]</ref>\n|-\n|1930\u201331\n|Attilio Giuliani,<br />Ines Alfani-Tellini,<br />Lorenzo Conati,<br />Christy Solari\n|[[Lorenzo Molajoli]]<br />[[Teatro alla Scala]], Milan Orchestra and Chorus\n|78rpm records: Columbia<br />Cat: GQX 10100-10105\n|-\n|1932\n|[[Ernesto Badini]],<br />Adelaide Saraceni,<br />[[Afro Poli]],<br />[[Tito Schipa]]\n|[[Carlo Sabajno]]<br />La Scala Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Arkadia<br />Cat: 2CD 78017\n|-\n|1952\n|[[Sesto Bruscantini]],<br>[[Alda Noni]],<br>Mario Borriello,<br>[[Cesare Valletti]]\n|[[Mario Rossi]],<br>Orchestra e Coro Sinfonica di Torino della RAI\n|CD: Warner Fonit Cetra<br>Cat: 8573 87476-2\n|-\n|1964\n|[[Fernando Corena]],<br />[[Graziella Sciutti]],<br />[[Tom Krause]],<br />[[Juan Oncina]]\n|[[Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)|Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz]]<br />Vienna State Opera Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Decca \"Originals\"<br />Cat: 897402<ref name=greenfield>[[Edward Greenfield|Greenfield, Edward]], March, Ivan, Czajkowski, Paul, and Layton, Robert (2011).

It was based on a libretto by  [[Angelo Anelli]] for [[Stefano Pavesi]]'s opera ''[[Ser Marcantonio]]'' written in 1810<ref>Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244</ref> but, on the published libretto, the author appears as \"M.A.\"\n\nDonizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century,<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 174</ref> but as [[Herbert Weinstock]] establishes, it was largely Ruffini's work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, \"Donizetti or [his assistant] Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini's name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi's initials as to a pseudonym\".<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 363</ref>\n\nThe opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien]] at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris with great success<ref>Donizetti 1870; Chouquet 1889, p. 238. (Chouquet mistakenly gives 4 January as the date of the premiere)</ref> and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century ''opera buffa'' tradition and, in fact, marking its ending.\n\n==Composition history==\n{{multiple image\n | align=left\n | width1 = 200\n | image1 = Engraved portrait of opera singer Giulia Grisi, dressed to perform \"Norma\" (1844).jpg\n | caption1 = Giulia Grisi, 1844\n | width2= 172\n | image2 = Antonio Tamburini II Litho.jpg\n | caption2 = Antonio Tamburini\n }}\nDonizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by [[Jules Janin]], the newly appointed director of the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien'', that he might compose a new opera for that house.<ref name=WEIN88-90>Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013190</ref>  Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new ''opera buffa'' tailored to the talents of some major singers including [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Antonio Tamburini]], and [[Luigi Lablache]].<ref name=WEIN88-90/>\n\n{{anchor|Accursi}} At around the same time in September, the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 librettist [[Giovanni Ruffini]], who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as \"Donizetti's Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent\" <ref name=WEIN88>Weinstock 1963, p. 188</ref>) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi's suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need \"a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don't know what.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89>Ruffini to his mother, 5 October; 11 October; and date unknown, in Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013189</ref>  In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: \"I've been eating up the paper, as they say.  It's not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that \"my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don't, so to say, recognize it as mine\".<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by [[Casa Ricordi]] as by \"M.A.\", since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\nIn the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. Pasquale is recognizable as the blustery [[Pantalone]], Ernesto as the lovesick [[Pierrot]], Malatesta as the scheming [[Scapino]], and Norina as a wily [[Columbina]]. The false ''Notary'' echoes a long line of false officials as operatic devices.\n\nWith rehearsals in progress in December 1842, it appeared that there was general pessimism as to its success: \"the atmosphere during rehearsals was frigid\" states Weinstock and records the lack of interest from the management and the orchestra musicians. \"The work had been condemned, judged\", he concludes.<ref name=WEIN194>Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>  However, during the evening of the final dress rehearsal, Donizetti added a new piece which he had already written for the tenor, ''Com'\u00e8 gentil'', which was designed for the third act. As for fears for the opera's success, the composer had none: \"Have no fear for me...My work will be a success\", he stated.<ref>Donizetti to Escudier, in Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\nAt its premiere ''Don Pasquale'' was performed by four of the most celebrated singers of the day<ref>Harewood & Peattie 1997, p. 211; Ashbrook 1992, p. 1224.</ref> and was an immediate success.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 194; Ashbrook 1982, p. 175.</ref><ref>Reviews of the premiere: ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/revueetgazettemu1843pari#page/11/mode/1up vol 10, no. 2 (8 january 1843)] (in French); ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5621446p/f1.image vol. 10, no. 6 (8 January 1843)] (in French).</ref> It was recognized at the time as Donizetti's comic masterpiece<ref>Budden 1992, p. 1211; Harewood & Peattie 1997, p. 211; Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244\u2013245.</ref> and, to this day, is still considered as such.

After a while, the ambience changes to suggesting a party, and the overture ends with a finale.\n\n===Act 1===\n''Scenes 1\u20133: A room in the home of Don Pasquale, at 9 o'clock''\n\nErnesto has refused the woman that his uncle Don Pasquale had found for him, and as a result is to be disinherited.  Ernesto declares his devotion to the young \u2013 but poor \u2013 widow Norina. In view of Ernesto's determination, Don Pasquale decides to marry in old age to produce his own heir, and anxiously awaits the arrival of his physician, Dr. Malatesta, who is determined to teach Don Pasquale how foolish he is being, but has been pretending to search for a suitable bride.  Malatesta, confronted with Pasquale's impatience, mutters that he is a buffoon, but proceeds to describe the attributes of the bride-to-be (''Bella siccome un angelo'' \u2013 \"Beautiful like an angel\").  Honest, modest and sweet \u2013 when pressed, Malatesta reveals she is in fact his sister.  Overcome with joy, Pasquale demands to meet her at once, and sends Malatesta to fetch her, before singing of the love that has gripped him (''Ah, un foco insolito'' \u2013 \"A sudden fire\").\n\nErnesto comes back and pleads with the Don to consult with his friend Malatesta \u2013 when he hears that Malatesta supposedly supports Pasquale, he is amazed at this apparent betrayal (''Mi fa il destino mendico'' \u2013 \"Fate has made a beggar of me\").  Ernesto determines to elope and writes to tell Norina that all is lost.\n\n''Scenes 4\u20135: An apartment in the home of Norina''\n\nNorina sits alone, reading a book.  She recites a passage, before laughing at the situation described and reflecting on her own temperament (''So anch'io la virt\u00f9 magica'' \u2013 \"I too know your magical virtues\").  She is in cahoots with Dr. Malatesta and impatiently waits for him to come and explain his plan at which he had only hinted.  A servant delivers the letter from Ernesto, which she quickly reads and is instantly dismayed.\n\nMalatesta arrives to explain the stratagem, but Norina cuts him off and hands him the letter, which he reads aloud: Ernesto has announced his intention to leave Rome, and Europe altogether.  Malatesta reassures her, saying that he has adapted his plan: Norina shall play the part of Malatesta's sister.  Having arranged for his cousin to act as a notary, they will easily deceive the Don.  Norina consents to play her part in the deception, and they discuss her strategies in a lively duet (''Pronta son; purch'io non manchi'' \u2013 \"I am ready; if I do not miss\").\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Son tradito, calpestato (Don Pasquale).webm|thumb|Act II finale, \"Son tradito\", at the [[Liceu]] in 2015.  Cast: \nLorenzo Regazzo (Don Pasquale), Valentina Nafornita (Norina), Juan Francisco Gatell (Ernesto), [[Mariusz Kwiecien]] (Dottor Malatesta)]]\n''A salon in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nErnesto is alone: lamenting his fate, he considers his decision to leave Rome (''Cercher\u00f2 lontana terra'' \u2013 \"I shall seek a distant land\").  He leaves the room just as Pasquale enters, dressed in his outdated finery, along with his servants, to whom he gives instructions to admit Malatesta on his arrival.  He parades around in his grand costume, hoping it will conceal his advancing years.\n\nMalatesta arrives with Norina in tow, and introduces her to Pasquale as his sister, Sofronia, fresh out of the convent.  Pasquale is smitten, and Norina plays the part of a dutiful, modest and submissive lady, to Pasquale's satisfaction.  Norina consents to the proposed marriage, which delights Pasquale.  He wants to send for the notary to conduct the ceremony straight away \u2013 conveniently, Malatesta has brought one along, who waits in the antechamber.\n\nMalatesta fetches the supposed notary, as servants arrange a table.  Taking his seat, the \"notary\" writes out a marriage contract as dictated by Malatesta and Pasquale (''Fra da una parta'' \u2013 \"Between, on one hand\"), where the Don bequeaths all his estate to be administrated by Sofronia.  The contract is quickly drawn up: Pasquale signs but, before Norina can affix her signature, Ernesto bursts in.  Intending to say a final farewell, he is amazed to see Norina about to marry Pasquale.  However, Malatesta persuades him not to say anything (''Figliol non mi far scene'' \u2013 \"Son, don't make a scene\"), and he is forced to act as the final witness much to Don Pasquale's delight.\n\nAs soon as the contract is signed, Norina abandons her pretence of docility, and refuses Pasquale's embrace.  She announces her intention to teach ''him'' manners, and to have Ernesto as a gallant to accompany her on evening strolls.  Pasquale is horrified at this transformation, while Malatesta and Ernesto can barely conceal their amusement (''\u00c8 rimasto l\u00e0 impietrato'' \u2013 \"He stands there, petrified\").  Summoning the household staff, Norina recites a long list of demands \u2013 more servants (young and handsome at that), carriages and horses, furniture \u2013 and instructs them to spare no expense doubling all their wages.  Pasquale is stricken at his misfortune, so Malatesta urges him to go to bed.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Engraving premiere Don Pasquale at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien 1843 - La Fenice 2002 programma di sala p88.jpg|thumb|Staging of ''Don Pasquale'' at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris (1843)]]\n''Scenes 1\u20135: A room in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nPasquale sits in a room, surrounded by piles of newly purchased jewels, dresses and the like, as the servants bustle in and out of Norina's apartment (''I diamanti presto presto'' \u2013 \"The diamonds, quickly, quickly\").  Dismayed by the piles of bills and invoices, the Don summons the courage to confront his tyrannical new wife.  Norina emerges, dressed to go out.  He attempts to reason with her, but she pays little heed (''Signorina, in tanta fretta'' \u2013 \"Madam, where are you off to in such a hurry\").  He suggests that if she leaves, he may not allow her to return, an idea that she meets with patronising insincerity (''Via, caro sposino'' \u2013 \"There, there, dear little husband\") but the discussion ends in her slapping him.  As she exits, she drops a note which Pasquale picks up and reads.  The note is addressed to Sofronia, arranging a meeting in the garden with its unnamed, admiring author.  Pasquale calls for a servant to summon Malatesta, before leaving the room.\n\nThe servants return and, amongst themselves, at once complain at the amount of work they are being made to do, and reveal how much they are enjoying the farcical drama developing between Pasquale and his new wife (''Che interminabile andirivieni!'' \u2013 \"Such endless coming and going!\").  At the approach of Malatesta and Ernesto, however, they exit, assured of more entertainment to come.  Malatesta reminds Ernesto of the finer points of their plan, and the latter leaves.  The doctor moves forward to greet Don Pasquale, who tells him of Norina's intended assignation, and his own plan to expose her unfaithfulness before a magistrate.  Malatesta persuades him to moderate his plan and Pasquale, believing him an ally, consents to his conditions, while plotting his revenge on Norina (''Aspetta, aspetta, cara sposina'' \u2013 \"Wait, wait, dear little wife\").\n\n''Scenes 6\u20137: The garden, adjoining Pasquale's house''\n\nIn the garden, as night draws in, Ernesto sings of his love for Norina, as he waits for her arrival (''Com'\u00e8 gentil'' \u2013 \"How lovely\").  At last, Norina emerges, and they express their love: (''Tornami a dir che m'ami'' \u2013 \"Tell me once more that you love me\").  Don Pasquale and Malatesta have observed and, as they reveal themselves, Ernesto covers himself with a cloak and runs to the house.  Pasquale tries to confront Norina \u2013 he has caught her ''in flagrante'' \u2013 but this only provokes a fight that leaves the Don spluttering.  She refuses to leave at his demand, so Malatesta, as per his agreement with Pasquale, takes over.  Pretending to negotiate with Norina/Sofronia, he tells Pasquale that the only way to make her leave will be to allow Ernesto to marry his beloved, whom \"Sofronia\" apparently despises.  Pasquale consents, and calls out to the house, from which Ernesto and the servants emerge.  He instructs Ernesto to send for his would-be bride, but Malatesta reveals that Norina is in fact the woman Pasquale thinks he married, while the real Sofronia remains in a convent.  All are reconciled, and the moral of the story \u2013 not to marry in old age \u2013 is revealed in a playful quartet (''La moral di tutto questo'' \u2013 \"The moral of all this\").\n\n==Recordings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Cast<br/>(Don Pasquale,<br>Norina,<br>Malatesta,<br>Ernesto)\n!Conductor,<br/>Opera house and orchestra\n!Label<ref>[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLDODONP.HTM Source of recording on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk]</ref>\n|-\n|1930\u201331\n|Attilio Giuliani,<br />Ines Alfani-Tellini,<br />Lorenzo Conati,<br />Christy Solari\n|[[Lorenzo Molajoli]]<br />[[Teatro alla Scala]], Milan Orchestra and Chorus\n|78rpm records: Columbia<br />Cat: GQX 10100-10105\n|-\n|1932\n|[[Ernesto Badini]],<br />Adelaide Saraceni,<br />[[Afro Poli]],<br />[[Tito Schipa]]\n|[[Carlo Sabajno]]<br />La Scala Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Arkadia<br />Cat: 2CD 78017\n|-\n|1952\n|[[Sesto Bruscantini]],<br>[[Alda Noni]],<br>Mario Borriello,<br>[[Cesare Valletti]]\n|[[Mario Rossi]],<br>Orchestra e Coro Sinfonica di Torino della RAI\n|CD: Warner Fonit Cetra<br>Cat: 8573 87476-2\n|-\n|1964\n|[[Fernando Corena]],<br />[[Graziella Sciutti]],<br />[[Tom Krause]],<br />[[Juan Oncina]]\n|[[Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)|Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz]]<br />Vienna State Opera Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Decca \"Originals\"<br />Cat: 897402<ref name=greenfield>[[Edward Greenfield|Greenfield, Edward]], March, Ivan, Czajkowski, Paul, and Layton, Robert (2011).

The set's five CDs and one VHS tape compile nearly all of the band's original catalogue, newly remastered from the original master tapes, and a wealth of previously unreleased material, the latter of which includes a live CD and a VHS video cassette of live footage.\n\nOf Samhain's previous official releases, only the original mix of the [[Unholy Passion EP]] was not included in the boxed set; conjecture is that the original master tapes had been lost over the years, or were erased when Danzig re-recorded the guitar and some vocal tracks to those songs in June 1987 for eventual release as side B of the original ''[[Final Descent (album)|Final Descent]]''.\n\n==Special packaging==\nThe outer box cover was painted by [[Martin Emond]], who had previously provided artwork for singer [[Glenn Danzig]]'s post-Samhain band, [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], and comic book company [[Verotik]]. Within the box, each of the five CDs came in its own \"mini-LP\" sleeve (unlike the jewel-cases used for the individual CD reissues the following year). Also included was a 32-page booklet of photographs and reprinted lyrics to Discs One and Three. \n\nThe boxed set was advertised as \"a $75 value, all for just $59.95\" ([[USD]]), and is now out of print. If pre-ordered online through distributor E-Magine Music's website, the first pressing of the boxed set was shipped two weeks prior to the street date, with the first 1,000 packaged with an \"internet exclusive\" bonus metal pin of the \"scarecrow beast\" character that appeared on Samhain T-shirts in the 1980s (similar to the one on the cover of the [[November-Coming-Fire]] album). \n\nSecond pressings of the boxed set omitted the bonus pin, but included \"the previously unreleased Samhain comic book\" by ''Mr. Monster'' creator [[Michael T.

The set's five CDs and one VHS tape compile nearly all of the band's original catalogue, newly remastered from the original master tapes, and a wealth of previously unreleased material, the latter of which includes a live CD and a VHS video cassette of live footage.\n\nOf Samhain's previous official releases, only the original mix of the [[Unholy Passion EP]] was not included in the boxed set; conjecture is that the original master tapes had been lost over the years, or were erased when Danzig re-recorded the guitar and some vocal tracks to those songs in June 1987 for eventual release as side B of the original ''[[Final Descent]]''.\n\n==Special packaging==\nThe outer box cover was painted by [[Martin Emond]], who had previously provided artwork for singer [[Glenn Danzig]]'s post-Samhain band, [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], and comic book company [[Verotik]]. Within the box, each of the five CDs came in its own \"mini-LP\" sleeve (unlike the jewel-cases used for the individual CD reissues the following year). Also included was a 32-page booklet of photographs and reprinted lyrics to Discs One and Three. \n\nThe boxed set was advertised as \"a $75 value, all for just $59.95\" ([[USD]]), and is now out of print. If pre-ordered online through distributor E-Magine Music's website, the first pressing of the boxed set was shipped two weeks prior to the street date, with the first 1,000 packaged with an \"internet exclusive\" bonus metal pin of the \"scarecrow beast\" character that appeared on Samhain T-shirts in the 1980s (similar to the one on the cover of the [[November-Coming-Fire]] album). \n\nSecond pressings of the boxed set omitted the bonus pin, but included \"the previously unreleased Samhain comic book\" by ''Mr. Monster'' creator [[Michael T. Gilbert]] (with four uncredited pages by Sean Wyett, who also illustrated Danzig for the back cover of the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]' ''[[Legacy of Brutality]]''). The \"contents\" listing on the back of the box was modified to reflect the comic's inclusion. Some boxed sets were reportedly shipped with both the bonus metal pin and the comic.\n\n==Track listing==\n===''Initium'' (Disc One)===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Samhain Initium.jpg|thumb|Initium]] -->\n\n#\"Initium\" / \"Samhain\"\n#\"Black Dream\"\n#\"All Murder, All Guts, All Fun\"\n#\"Macabre\"\n#\"He-Who-Can-Not-Be-Named\"\n#\"Horror Biz\"\n#\"The Shift\"\n#\"The Howl\"\n#\"Archangel\"\n\n===''Unholy Passion'' (Disc Two)===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:UnholyPassion.jpg|thumb|Unholy Passion]] -->\n\n#\"Unholy Passion\"\n#\"All Hell\"\n#\"Moribund\"\n#\"The Hungry End\"\n#\"Misery Tomb\"\n#\"I Am Misery\"\n\n===''Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire'' (Disc Three)===\n[[Image:Samhain NovComFire.jpg|thumb|Front cover for ''[[Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire|November-Coming-Fire]]'' (1986) by Samhain.|225x225px]]\n#\"Diabolos '88\"\n#\"In My Grip\"\n#\"Mother of Mercy\"\n#\"Birthright\"\n#\"To Walk the Night\"\n#\"Let the Day Begin\"\n#\"Halloween II\"\n#\"November's Fire\"\n#\"Kiss of Steel\"\n#\"Unbridled\"\n#\"Human Pony Girl\"\n\n===''Final Descent'' (Disc Four)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:boxFinalDescent.jpg|thumb|Final Descent]] -->\n\n#\"Night Chill\"\n#\"Descent\"\n#\"Death...In Its Arms\"\n#\"Lords of the Left Hand\"\n#\"The Birthing\"\n#\"Twist of Cain\" \n#\"Possession\" \n#\"Trouble\" \n#\"Lords of the Left Hand: 2nd Version\" \n\n===''Samhain Live '85-'86'' (Disc Five)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BoxLive8586.jpg|thumb|Samhain Live '85-86]] -->\n* Tracks 1-10: Live 19 February 1985 at [[Danceteria]], New York, NY.\n* Tracks 11-18: Live 13 April 1986 at the [[Metro Chicago|Cabaret Metro]], Chicago, IL\n\n#\"All Hell\"\n#\"Samhain\"\n#\"The Shift\"\n#\"The Howl\"\n#\"Unholy Passion\"\n#\"All Murder, All Guts, All Fun\"\n#\"I Am Misery\"\n#\"The Hungry End\"\n#\"Horror Biz\"\n#\"He-Who-Can-Not-Be-Named\"\n#\"Black Dream\"\n#\"Death Comes Ripping\"\n#\"Mother of Mercy\"\n#\"To Walk the Night\"\n#\"Halloween II\"\n#\"In My Grip\"\n#\"London Dungeon\"\n#\"Archangel\"\n\n===''Live VHS''===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SamhainVHS.jpg|thumb|Samhain Live VHS]] -->\n\n* Tracks 1-8 recorded 13 April 1985 at Typographer's Hall, Baltimore, MD.\n* Tracks 9-13 recorded 13 April 1986 at The Cabaret Metro, Chicago, IL.\n* Tracks 14-16 recorded 14 July 1986 at The Ritz, New York, NY.\n\n#\"All Murder, All Guts, All Fun\"\n#\"The Shift\"\n#\"Unholy Passion\"\n#\"Black Dream\"\n#\"The Hungry End\"\n#\"I Am Misery\"\n#\"Horror Biz\"\n#\"Moribund\"\n#\"All Hell\"\n#\"London Dungeon\"\n#\"Archangel\"\n#\"Mother of Mercy\"\n#\"To Walk the Night\"\n#\"Samhain\"\n#\"Moribund\"\n#\"Black Dream\"\n\n==Notes==\n* Disc Two marks the first time the remixed ''Unholy Passion'' EP was presented as a single CD on its own, though the contents had been added to the first CD pressing of [[Initium]] in 1987, and again to the original [[Final Descent]] in 1990.
