It was the second-largest ghetto in all of [[German-occupied Europe]] after the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. Situated in the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and originally intended as a preliminary step upon a more extensive plan of creating the ''[[Judenfrei]]'' province of [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Warthegau]],<ref>Horwitz 2009, p. 27. ''Plan hammered out by [[Friedrich Uebelhoer]].''</ref> the ghetto was transformed into a major industrial centre, manufacturing war supplies for [[Nazi Germany]] and especially for the [[Wehrmacht]].<ref name=\"Horwitz\"/> The number of people incarcerated in it was increased further by the Jews deported from the [[Third Reich]] territories.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary1\"/>\n\nOn 30 April 1940, when the gates closed on the ghetto, it housed 163,777 residents.<ref name=\"USHMM_Camps\"/> Because of its remarkable productivity, the ghetto managed to survive until August 1944. In the first two years, it absorbed almost 20,000 Jews from liquidated ghettos in nearby Polish towns and villages,<ref name=\"biuletyn60\"/> as well as 20,000 more from the rest of [[German-occupied Europe]].<ref name=\"jewishgen/timeline\"/> After the wave of deportations to [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp|Che\u0142mno death camp]] beginning in early 1942,<ref name=\"jewishgen/timeline\"/> and in spite of a stark reversal of fortune, the Germans persisted in eradicating the ghetto: they transported the remaining population to [[Auschwitz]] and Che\u0142mno [[extermination camp]]s, where most were murdered upon arrival.

The Jews were entirely dependent on the German authorities for food, medicine and other vital supplies. To exacerbate the situation, the only legal currency in the ghetto was a specially created [[ghetto currency]]. Faced with starvation, Jews traded their remaining possessions and savings for this [[scrip]], thereby abetting the process by which they were dispossessed of their remaining belongings.<ref name=\"ringelblum-86\"/>\n\n== Food consumption and malnutrition ==\nJews within the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto had an average daily intake of 1,000 to 1,200 calories which led directly to starvation and even to death. The process of purchasing food relied heavily on the quantity and quality of the goods that the Ghetto citizens brought from their houses into the Ghetto. Previous social class and wealth of Ghetto inhabitants often determined the fate of food accessibility. While the wealthy could purchase additional food, many of the lower class Jewish inhabitants relied heavily on the ration card system. Food embezzlement by police forces within the Ghetto encouraged hierarchy even amongst Jewish neighbors.  Food became a means of control for the German forces and by the Jewish policing administration.\n\nFood deprivation often caused strain on family relations but parents, siblings, and spouses would also hold out on their portion of food for the benefit of loved ones. People would trade furniture and clothing to receive food for their family members or themselves. Jewish women invented new ways of cooking in order to make food and supplies last longer. Tuberculosis and other diseases were widespread due to malnutrition. The physical attributes of malnutrition in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto led to sunken eyes, swollen abdomens and aged appearances while also stunting the growth of Ghetto children. <ref>{{Citation|last=Sinnreich|first=Helene J.|chapter=Hunger in the ghettos|date=2017-11-27|pages=110\u2013126|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-09977-4|doi=10.4324/9781315099774-9|title=The Ghetto in Global History}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nAdministratively, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto was subject to the City Council.

From October 1940, the facility was raised to the rank of an independent department of the city council - Gettoverwaltung, reporting to Mayor Werner Ventzki. Initially, the main tasks of the ghetto board were supplying, supplying medicines and settling the ghetto with the city. Soon, however, the inhabitants began to be plundered and exploited to the maximum, transforming the ghetto into a forced labor camp in hunger for food rations and extreme living conditions. From 1942, Hans Biebow and his deputies J\u00f3zef Haemmerle and Wilhelm Ribbe demonstrated in the selection and displacement of ghetto inhabitants, and Biebow and his commercial capabilities were quickly appreciated by the dignitaries of the central authorities of the Warta Country. Biebow became the real ruler of the ghetto, and Gettoverwaltung officials arrived at a rapid pace - from 24 people in May 1940 to 216 in mid-1942.<ref>Ilustrowana Encyklopedia Historii \u0141\u00f3d\u017ai, p. 18</ref>\n\n[[File:Rumkowski.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chaim Rumkowski]] delivering a speech in the ghetto, 1941{{ndash}}42]]\nTo organize the local population and maintain order, the German authorities established a Jewish Council commonly called the ''[[Judenrat]]'' or the ''\u00c4ltestenrat'' (\"Council of Elders\") in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The chairman of the ''Judenrat'' appointed by the Nazi administration was [[Chaim Rumkowski]] (age 62 in 1939). Even today, he is still considered one of the most controversial figures in the history of the [[Holocaust]].

By 1943, some 95 percent of the adult population was employed in 117 workshops, which \u2013 Rumkowski once boasted to the mayor of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 were a \"gold mine.\" It was possibly because of this productivity that the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto managed to survive long after all the other ghettos in occupied Poland were liquidated. Rumkowski systematically singled out for expulsion his political opponents, or anyone who might have had the capacity to lead a resistance to the Nazis.  Conditions were harsh and the population was entirely dependent on the Germans. Typical intake, made available, averaged between 700 and 900 calories per day, about half the calories required for survival.{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2008|page=117|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ugVsNrbMSx4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=minimal%2Bneed&f=false  Minimal need]}} People affiliated with Rumkowski received disproportionately larger deliveries of food, medicine, and other rationed necessities. Everywhere else starvation was rampant and diseases like [[tuberculosis]] widespread, fueling dissatisfaction with Rumkowski's administration, which led to a series of [[Strike action|strikes]] in the factories. In most instances, Rumkowski relied on the Jewish police to quell the discontented workers, although at least in one instance, the German Order Police was asked to intervene. Strikes usually erupted over the reduction of food rations.{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2008|page=xlii}}\n\n[[File:Paper factory.JPG|thumbnail|right|Young girl working in the paper factory]]\n\nDisease was a major feature of ghetto life with which the ''Judenrat'' had to contend.

Initially, they created 47 schools and daycare facilities which continued to operate despite harsh conditions. Later, when the school buildings were converted to new living quarters for some 20,000 inmates brought in from outside occupied Poland, alternatives were established, particularly for younger children whose mothers were forced to work. Schools tried to provide children with adequate nourishment despite meager rations. After the schools were shut down in 1941, many of the factories continued to maintain illegal daycare centres for children whose mothers were working.<ref name=\"Heberer\">Heberer, Patricia.

In one such instance, a strike got so violent that the German [[Ordnungspolizei|Orpo]] police were called upon to suppress it. At the same time, the rich cultural life included active theatres, concerts, and banned religious gatherings, all of which countered official attempts at dehumanization.

One of them, [[Henryk Ross]], managed to bury the negatives and dig them up after liberation, at 12 Jagielonska Street. Because of this archive, the reality of the ghetto was recorded and preserved. The archivists also began creating a ghetto encyclopedia and a [[lexicon]] of the local slang that emerged in their daily lives. The Jewish population maintained several illegal radios with which they kept abreast of events in the outside world. At first, the radio could only receive German broadcast, which is why it was codenamed the \"Liar\" in the diaries. Among the news that quickly spread around the ghetto was the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] on the day it occurred.{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2008|page=53}}\n\nSince production was essential to the German war effort, the slowing down of work was also a form of resistance.

The Jews were entirely dependent on the German authorities for food, medicine and other vital supplies. To exacerbate the situation, the only legal currency in the ghetto was a specially created [[ghetto currency]]. Faced with starvation, Jews traded their remaining possessions and savings for this [[scrip]], thereby abetting the process by which they were dispossessed of their remaining belongings.<ref name=\"ringelblum-86\"/>\n\n== Food consumption and malnutrition ==\nJews within the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto had an average daily intake of 1,000 to 1,200 calories which led directly to starvation and even to death. The process of purchasing food relied heavily on the quantity and quality of the goods that the Ghetto citizens brought from their houses into the Ghetto. Previous social class and wealth of Ghetto inhabitants often determined the fate of food accessibility. While the wealthy could purchase additional food, many of the lower class Jewish inhabitants relied heavily on the ration card system. Food embezzlement by police forces within the Ghetto encouraged hierarchy even amongst Jewish neighbors.  Food became a means of control for the German forces and by the Jewish policing administration.\n\nFood deprivation often caused strain on family relations but parents, siblings, and spouses would also hold out on their portion of food for the benefit of loved ones. People would trade furniture and clothing to receive food for their family members or themselves. Jewish women invented new ways of cooking in order to make food and supplies last longer. Tuberculosis and other diseases were widespread due to malnutrition. The physical attributes of malnutrition in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto led to sunken eyes, swollen abdomens and aged appearances while also stunting the growth of Ghetto children. <ref>{{Citation|last=Sinnreich|first=Helene J.|chapter=Hunger in the ghettos|date=2017-11-27|pages=110\u2013126|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-09977-4|doi=10.4324/9781315099774-9|title=The Ghetto in Global History}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nAdministratively, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto was subject to the City Council.

From October 1940, the facility was raised to the rank of an independent department of the city council - Gettoverwaltung, reporting to Mayor Werner Ventzki. Initially, the main tasks of the ghetto board were supplying, supplying medicines and settling the ghetto with the city. Soon, however, the inhabitants began to be plundered and exploited to the maximum, transforming the ghetto into a forced labor camp in hunger for food rations and extreme living conditions. From 1942, Hans Biebow and his deputies J\u00f3zef Haemmerle and Wilhelm Ribbe demonstrated in the selection and displacement of ghetto inhabitants, and Biebow and his commercial capabilities were quickly appreciated by the dignitaries of the central authorities of the Warta Country. Biebow became the real ruler of the ghetto, and Gettoverwaltung officials arrived at a rapid pace - from 24 people in May 1940 to 216 in mid-1942.<ref>Ilustrowana Encyklopedia Historii \u0141\u00f3d\u017ai, p. 18</ref>\n\n[[File:Rumkowski.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chaim Rumkowski]] delivering a speech in the ghetto, 1941{{ndash}}42]]\nTo organize the local population and maintain order, the German authorities established a Jewish Council commonly called the ''[[Judenrat]]'' or the ''\u00c4ltestenrat'' (\"Council of Elders\") in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The chairman of the ''Judenrat'' appointed by the Nazi administration was [[Chaim Rumkowski]] (age 62 in 1939). Even today, he is still considered one of the most controversial figures in the history of the [[Holocaust]].

By 1943, some 95 percent of the adult population was employed in 117 workshops, which \u2013 Rumkowski once boasted to the mayor of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 were a \"gold mine.\" It was possibly because of this productivity that the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto managed to survive long after all the other ghettos in occupied Poland were liquidated. Rumkowski systematically singled out for expulsion his political opponents, or anyone who might have had the capacity to lead a resistance to the Nazis.  Conditions were harsh and the population was entirely dependent on the Germans. Typical intake, made available, averaged between 700 and 900 calories per day, about half the calories required for survival.{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2008|page=117|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ugVsNrbMSx4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=minimal%2Bneed&f=false  Minimal need]}} People affiliated with Rumkowski received disproportionately larger deliveries of food, medicine, and other rationed necessities. Everywhere else starvation was rampant and diseases like [[tuberculosis]] widespread, fueling dissatisfaction with Rumkowski's administration, which led to a series of [[Strike action|strikes]] in the factories. In most instances, Rumkowski relied on the Jewish police to quell the discontented workers, although at least in one instance, the German Order Police was asked to intervene. Strikes usually erupted over the reduction of food rations.{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2008|page=xlii}}\n\n[[File:Paper factory.JPG|thumbnail|right|Young girl working in the paper factory]]\n\nDisease was a major feature of ghetto life with which the ''Judenrat'' had to contend.

Initially, they created 47 schools and daycare facilities which continued to operate despite harsh conditions. Later, when the school buildings were converted to new living quarters for some 20,000 inmates brought in from outside occupied Poland, alternatives were established, particularly for younger children whose mothers were forced to work. Schools tried to provide children with adequate nourishment despite meager rations. After the schools were shut down in 1941, many of the factories continued to maintain illegal daycare centres for children whose mothers were working.<ref name=\"Heberer\">Heberer, Patricia.

At the same time, the rich cultural life included active theatres, concerts, and banned religious gatherings, all of which countered official attempts at dehumanization.

The archivists also began creating a ghetto encyclopedia and a [[lexicon]] of the local slang that emerged in their daily lives. The Jewish population maintained several illegal radios with which they kept abreast of events in the outside world.

It was one of the world's three busiest whaling ports for several decades beginning in the early 19th century, along with [[Nantucket]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city's present architecture. The city subsequently became home to other shipping and manufacturing industries, but it has gradually lost most of its industrial heart.\n\nNew London is home to the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]], [[Connecticut College]], [[Mitchell College]], and [[The Williams School]]. The [[Coast Guard Station New London]] and New London Harbor is home port to the Coast Guard Cutter ''Chinook'' and the Coast Guard's tall ship [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|''Eagle'']]. The city had a population of 27,620 at the 2010 census.

[[John Winthrop, Jr.]] founded the first English settlement here in 1646, making it about the 13th town settled in Connecticut. Inhabitants informally referred to it as Nameaug or as Pequot after the tribe. In the 1650s, the colonists wanted to give the town the official name of London after [[London, England]], but the [[Connecticut General Assembly]] wanted to name it Faire Harbour. The citizens protested, declaring that they would prefer it to be called Nameaug if it couldn't be officially named London.<ref name=\"Marrin2007\">{{cite book|first=Richard B.|last=Marrin|title=Abstracts from the New London Gazette Covering Southeastern Connecticut, 1763-1769|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2LanJi-x6MC&pg=PA242|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Heritage Books|isbn=978-0-7884-4171-4|pages=242}}</ref><ref>Frances Manwaring Caulkins, ''History of New London, Connecticut, from the first survey of the coast in 1612 to 1860'', Library of Congress, 1895.</ref> The legislature relented, and the town was officially named New London on March 10, 1658.\n\n===American Revolution===\nThe harbor was considered to be the best deep water harbor on [[Long Island Sound]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=New London |volume=19 |pages=515\u2013516}}</ref> and consequently New London became a base of [[U.S. Navy|American naval operations]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Famous New Londoners during the American Revolution include [[Nathan Hale]], William Coit, Richard Douglass, Thomas and Nathaniel Shaw, [[Samuel Holden Parsons|Gen. Samuel Parsons]], printer Timothy Green, and Bishop [[Samuel Seabury (bishop)|Samuel Seabury]].\n\nNew London was raided and much of it burned to the ground on September 6, 1781 in the [[Battle of Groton Heights]] by [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] native [[Benedict Arnold]] in an attempt to destroy the Revolutionary [[privateer]] fleet and supplies of goods and naval stores within the city. It is often noted that this raid on New London and Groton was intended to divert General [[George Washington]] and the French Army under [[Rochambeau, Jean-Baptiste-Donatien|Rochambeau]] from their march on [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. The main defensive fort for New London was [[Fort Griswold]], located across the Thames River in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. It was well known to Arnold, who sold its secrets to the British fleet so that they could avoid its [[artillery]] fire. The British overran New London's [[Fort Trumbull]], while other soldiers moved in to attack Ft. Griswold across the river, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[William Ledyard]]. The British suffered great casualties at Ft. Griswold before the Americans were finally forced to surrender\u2014whereupon the British stormed into and slaughtered most of the militia who defended it, including Colonel Ledyard. All told, more than 52 British soldiers and 83 militia were killed, and more than 142 British and 39 militia were wounded, many mortally. New London suffered over 6 militia killed and 24 wounded, while Arnold and the British and Hessian raiding party suffered an equal amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleofgrotonheights.com |title=The Battle of Groton Heights & Burning of New London |publisher=Battleofgrotonheights.com |date=August 31, 2006 |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's independent legislature made New London one of the first two cities brought from ''de facto'' to formalized incorporations in its January session of 1784, along with [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].\n\n===19th century===\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], [[torpedo]]es were employed in attempts to destroy British vessels and protect American harbors.  In fact, a submarine-deployed torpedo was used in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy [[HMS Ramillies (1785)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] while in New London's harbor.  This prompted British Capt. Hardy to warn the Americans to cease efforts with the use of any \"torpedo boat\" in this \"cruel and unheard-of warfare\", or he would \"order every house near the shore to be destroyed.\"<ref name=Lossing>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=692}}</ref>{{rp|693}}\n\nFor several decades beginning in the early 19th century, New London was one of the three busiest [[whaling]] ports in the world, along with [[Nantucket]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city's present architecture.\n\nThe [[New Haven and New London Railroad]] connected New London by rail to New Haven and points beyond by the 1850s. The [[Springfield and New London Railroad]] connected New London to [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] by the 1870s.\n\n===Military presence===\nSeveral military installations have been part of New London's history, including the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] and [[Coast Guard Station New London]].<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/d1/sectlis/units/staNewLondon/ Coast Guard Station New London official web page]</ref> Most of these military installations have been located at [[Fort Trumbull]]. The first Fort Trumbull was an earthwork built 1775-1777 that took part in the Revolutionary War. The second Fort Trumbull was built 1839-1852 and still stands. By 1910, the fort's defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the [[Endicott Board|Endicott Program]], primarily located on [[Fishers Island]]. The fort was turned over to the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] and became the Revenue Cutter Academy. The Revenue Cutter Service was merged into the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1915, and the Academy relocated to its current site in 1932. During [[World War II]], the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] Officers Training School was located at Fort Trumbull. From 1950 to 1990, Fort Trumbull was the location for the [[Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory]], which developed [[sonar]] and related systems for [[US Navy]] [[submarine]]s. In 1990, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the [[Naval Underwater Systems Center]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and the New London facility was closed in 1996.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026194651/http://www.geocities.com/~jmgould/trumhist.html The History of Fort Trumbull by John Duchesneau]</ref><ref>[http://www.fortfriends.org/history.htm Fort Trumbull History Site]</ref>\n\nThe [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] is physically located in Groton, but submarines were stationed in New London from 1951 to 1991. The [[submarine tender]] [[USS Fulton (AS-11)|''Fulton'']] and [[Submarine Squadron 10]] were at State Pier in New London during this time. Squadron Ten was usually composed of eight to ten submarines and was the first all-nuclear submarine squadron. In the 1990s, State Pier was rebuilt as a [[freight container|container]] terminal. \nDuring the [[Red Summer]] of 1919, there were [[New London riots of 1919|a series of racial riots]] between white and black Navy men stationed in New London and Groton.{{sfn|Rucker|Upton|2007|p=554}}{{sfn|The Greeneville Daily Sun|1919|p=1}}{{sfn|Voogd|2008|p=95}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:New London Map 49%.png|thumb|right|49% of New London's area is water.]]\nIn terms of land area, New London is one of the smallest cities in Connecticut.

Towns set off since include:\n* [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] in 1649\n** This large area ran from the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]] to the [[Pawcatuck River]], including [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut|Pawcatuck]], Wequetequock, and the easterly half of [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]]. It stretched inland from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Lantern Hill]].\n* [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] in 1705\n** [[Ledyard, Connecticut|Ledyard]] (originally North Groton) created from a part of Groton in 1836\n* [[Montville, Connecticut|Montville]] in 1786\n** [[Salem, Connecticut|Salem]] created from parts of Montville, Colchester, and Lyme in 1819\n* [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] in 1801\n** [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] created from parts of Waterford and Lyme in 1839\n* [[Fishers Island]] officially left Connecticut and became part of New York in 1879.\n\n===Climate===\nNew London has a Cfa or temperate climate in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with long, hot and humid summers, and cool winters with modest snowfall. The city averages 2,300 hours of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). New London lies in the broad transition zone between Continental climates ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Dfa'') to the north, and Temperate climates ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''cfa'') to the south, as is typical for much of coastal Connecticut.\n\nFrom May to late September, the southerly flow from the [[Bermuda High]] creates hot and humid tropical weather conditions. Daytime heating produces occasional thunderstorms with heavy but brief downpours. Daytime highs in summer are normally near 80 F, with occasional heat waves bringing high temperatures into the 90's F. Spring and Fall are mild in New London, with daytime highs in the 55 to 70 F range and lows in the 40 to 50 F range. The seaside location of the city creates a long growing season compared to areas inland. The first frost in the New London area is normally not until early November, almost three weeks later than parts of northern Connecticut. Winters are cool with a mix of rainfall and snowfall, or mixed precipitation. New London normally sees fewer than 25 days annually with snow cover. In mid-winter, there can be large differences in low temperatures between areas along the coastline and areas well inland, often as much as 15 F.\n\nTropical cyclones (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the New London metropolitan area, although infrequently. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 ([[Hurricane Carol|Carol]]), 1960 ([[Hurricane Donna|Donna]]), 1985 ([[Hurricane Gloria|Gloria]]). [[Hurricane Irene|Tropical Storm Irene]] (2011) also caused moderate damage along the Connecticut coast, as did [[Hurricane Sandy]] (which made landfall in New Jersey) in 2012.\n\nCoastal Connecticut (including New London) is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. New London averages about 90 days annually with freeze, about the same as Baltimore, Maryland. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. The growing season is quite long in New London, like much of coastal Connecticut and Long Island, NY, averaging 210 days from April 8 to November 5.\n\n{{Weather box New London}}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 5150\n|1810= 3238\n|1820= 3330\n|1830= 4335\n|1840= 5519\n|1850= 8991\n|1860= 10115\n|1870= 9576\n|1880= 10537\n|1890= 13757\n|1900= 17548\n|1910= 19659\n|1920= 25688\n|1930= 29640\n|1940= 30456\n|1950= 30551\n|1960= 34182\n|1970= 31630\n|1980= 28842\n|1990= 28540\n|2000= 25671\n|2010= 27620\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26939\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html U.S. Decennial Census]\n}}\n[[File:New London Population.png|thumb|left|Population since 1810]]\n\n===Recent estimates on demographics and economic status===\nAccording to the 2006\u20132008 [[American Community Survey]], non-Hispanic [[White American|whites]] made up 54.6% of New London's population.

New London===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions in a case that was referred to as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\".[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/][https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html] In the fall of 1996, the City Manager told Jordan that he was ineligible to be a police officer in New London because he scored too high on the written portion of the [[Wonderlic test]] intended to evaluate cognitive ability.\n\nNew London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. He filed suit in the District Court, where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that, where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective\u2026. [Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"[http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html] The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[https://aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html]\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:New London Union Station.JPG|thumb|right|New London Union Station]]\n\nDowntown New London is served by regional [[Southeast Area Transit]] buses, the [[Estuary Transit District]] public transit service between the New London transportation center and Old Saybrook, and interstate [[Greyhound Lines]] buses.

It was one of the world's three busiest whaling ports for several decades beginning in the early 19th century, along with [[Nantucket]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city's present architecture. The city subsequently became home to other shipping and manufacturing industries, but it has gradually lost most of its industrial heart.\n\nNew London is home to the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]], [[Connecticut College]], [[Mitchell College]], and [[The Williams School]]. The [[Coast Guard Station New London]] and New London Harbor is home port to the Coast Guard Cutter ''Chinook'' and the Coast Guard's tall ship [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|''Eagle'']]. The city had a population of 27,620 at the 2010 census.  The [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]]\u2013New London metropolitan area includes 21 towns and 274,055 people.\n\n==History==\n[[File:2013-07-28 Fort Trumbull - Thames Baseball Club.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Trumbull]], originally built on this site in 1777.

[[John Winthrop, Jr.]] founded the first English settlement here in 1646, making it about the 13th town settled in Connecticut. Inhabitants informally referred to it as Nameaug or as Pequot after the tribe. In the 1650s, the colonists wanted to give the town the official name of London after [[London, England]], but the [[Connecticut General Assembly]] wanted to name it Faire Harbour. The citizens protested, declaring that they would prefer it to be called Nameaug if it couldn't be officially named London.<ref name=\"Marrin2007\">{{cite book|first=Richard B.|last=Marrin|title=Abstracts from the New London Gazette Covering Southeastern Connecticut, 1763-1769|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2LanJi-x6MC&pg=PA242|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Heritage Books|isbn=978-0-7884-4171-4|pages=242}}</ref><ref>Frances Manwaring Caulkins, ''History of New London, Connecticut, from the first survey of the coast in 1612 to 1860'', Library of Congress, 1895.</ref> The legislature relented, and the town was officially named New London on March 10, 1658.\n\n===American Revolution===\nThe harbor was considered to be the best deep water harbor on [[Long Island Sound]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=New London |volume=19 |pages=515\u2013516}}</ref> and consequently New London became a base of [[U.S. Navy|American naval operations]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Famous New Londoners during the American Revolution include [[Nathan Hale]], William Coit, Richard Douglass, Thomas and Nathaniel Shaw, [[Samuel Holden Parsons|Gen. Samuel Parsons]], printer Timothy Green, and Bishop [[Samuel Seabury (bishop)|Samuel Seabury]].\n\nNew London was raided and much of it burned to the ground on September 6, 1781 in the [[Battle of Groton Heights]] by [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] native [[Benedict Arnold]] in an attempt to destroy the Revolutionary [[privateer]] fleet and supplies of goods and naval stores within the city. It is often noted that this raid on New London and Groton was intended to divert General [[George Washington]] and the French Army under [[Rochambeau, Jean-Baptiste-Donatien|Rochambeau]] from their march on [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. The main defensive fort for New London was [[Fort Griswold]], located across the Thames River in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. It was well known to Arnold, who sold its secrets to the British fleet so that they could avoid its [[artillery]] fire. The British overran New London's [[Fort Trumbull]], while other soldiers moved in to attack Ft. Griswold across the river, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[William Ledyard]]. The British suffered great casualties at Ft. Griswold before the Americans were finally forced to surrender\u2014whereupon the British stormed into and slaughtered most of the militia who defended it, including Colonel Ledyard.

In fact, a submarine-deployed torpedo was used in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy [[HMS Ramillies (1785)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] while in New London's harbor.  This prompted British Capt.

The wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city's present architecture.\n\nThe [[New Haven and New London Railroad]] connected New London by rail to New Haven and points beyond by the 1850s. The [[Springfield and New London Railroad]] connected New London to [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] by the 1870s.\n\n===Military presence===\nSeveral military installations have been part of New London's history, including the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] and [[Coast Guard Station New London]].<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/d1/sectlis/units/staNewLondon/ Coast Guard Station New London official web page]</ref> Most of these military installations have been located at [[Fort Trumbull]]. The first Fort Trumbull was an earthwork built 1775-1777 that took part in the Revolutionary War. The second Fort Trumbull was built 1839-1852 and still stands. By 1910, the fort's defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the [[Endicott Board|Endicott Program]], primarily located on [[Fishers Island]]. The fort was turned over to the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] and became the Revenue Cutter Academy. The Revenue Cutter Service was merged into the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1915, and the Academy relocated to its current site in 1932. During [[World War II]], the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] Officers Training School was located at Fort Trumbull. From 1950 to 1990, Fort Trumbull was the location for the [[Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory]], which developed [[sonar]] and related systems for [[US Navy]] [[submarine]]s. In 1990, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the [[Naval Underwater Systems Center]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and the New London facility was closed in 1996.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026194651/http://www.geocities.com/~jmgould/trumhist.html The History of Fort Trumbull by John Duchesneau]</ref><ref>[http://www.fortfriends.org/history.htm Fort Trumbull History Site]</ref>\n\nThe [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] is physically located in Groton, but submarines were stationed in New London from 1951 to 1991. The [[submarine tender]] [[USS Fulton (AS-11)|''Fulton'']] and [[Submarine Squadron 10]] were at State Pier in New London during this time. Squadron Ten was usually composed of eight to ten submarines and was the first all-nuclear submarine squadron. In the 1990s, State Pier was rebuilt as a [[freight container|container]] terminal. \nDuring the [[Red Summer]] of 1919, there were [[New London riots of 1919|a series of racial riots]] between white and black Navy men stationed in New London and Groton.{{sfn|Rucker|Upton|2007|p=554}}{{sfn|The Greeneville Daily Sun|1919|p=1}}{{sfn|Voogd|2008|p=95}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:New London Map 49%.png|thumb|right|49% of New London's area is water.]]\nIn terms of land area, New London is one of the smallest cities in Connecticut.

Towns set off since include:\n* [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] in 1649\n** This large area ran from the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]] to the [[Pawcatuck River]], including [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut|Pawcatuck]], Wequetequock, and the easterly half of [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]]. It stretched inland from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Lantern Hill]].\n* [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] in 1705\n** [[Ledyard, Connecticut|Ledyard]] (originally North Groton) created from a part of Groton in 1836\n* [[Montville, Connecticut|Montville]] in 1786\n** [[Salem, Connecticut|Salem]] created from parts of Montville, Colchester, and Lyme in 1819\n* [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] in 1801\n** [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] created from parts of Waterford and Lyme in 1839\n* [[Fishers Island]] officially left Connecticut and became part of New York in 1879.\n\n===Climate===\nNew London has a Cfa or temperate climate in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with long, hot and humid summers, and cool winters with modest snowfall. The city averages 2,300 hours of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). New London lies in the broad transition zone between Continental climates ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Dfa'') to the north, and Temperate climates ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''cfa'') to the south, as is typical for much of coastal Connecticut.\n\nFrom May to late September, the southerly flow from the [[Bermuda High]] creates hot and humid tropical weather conditions. Daytime heating produces occasional thunderstorms with heavy but brief downpours. Daytime highs in summer are normally near 80 F, with occasional heat waves bringing high temperatures into the 90's F. Spring and Fall are mild in New London, with daytime highs in the 55 to 70 F range and lows in the 40 to 50 F range. The seaside location of the city creates a long growing season compared to areas inland. The first frost in the New London area is normally not until early November, almost three weeks later than parts of northern Connecticut. Winters are cool with a mix of rainfall and snowfall, or mixed precipitation. New London normally sees fewer than 25 days annually with snow cover. In mid-winter, there can be large differences in low temperatures between areas along the coastline and areas well inland, often as much as 15 F.\n\nTropical cyclones (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the New London metropolitan area, although infrequently. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 ([[Hurricane Carol|Carol]]), 1960 ([[Hurricane Donna|Donna]]), 1985 ([[Hurricane Gloria|Gloria]]). [[Hurricane Irene|Tropical Storm Irene]] (2011) also caused moderate damage along the Connecticut coast, as did [[Hurricane Sandy]] (which made landfall in New Jersey) in 2012.\n\nCoastal Connecticut (including New London) is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. New London averages about 90 days annually with freeze, about the same as Baltimore, Maryland. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. The growing season is quite long in New London, like much of coastal Connecticut and Long Island, NY, averaging 210 days from April 8 to November 5.\n\n{{Weather box New London}}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 5150\n|1810= 3238\n|1820= 3330\n|1830= 4335\n|1840= 5519\n|1850= 8991\n|1860= 10115\n|1870= 9576\n|1880= 10537\n|1890= 13757\n|1900= 17548\n|1910= 19659\n|1920= 25688\n|1930= 29640\n|1940= 30456\n|1950= 30551\n|1960= 34182\n|1970= 31630\n|1980= 28842\n|1990= 28540\n|2000= 25671\n|2010= 27620\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26939\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html U.S. Decennial Census]\n}}\n[[File:New London Population.png|thumb|left|Population since 1810]]\n\n===Recent estimates on demographics and economic status===\nAccording to the 2006\u20132008 [[American Community Survey]], non-Hispanic [[White American|whites]] made up 54.6% of New London's population.

Badgers are a [[polyphyletic]] grouping, and are not a natural taxonomic grouping: badgers are united by possession of a squat body adapted for [[fossorial]] activity. All belong to the [[caniform]] suborder of [[carnivoran]] mammals. The 11 [[species]] of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies: Melinae (4 species, including the [[European badger]]), Helictidinae (5 species of [[ferret-badger]]), Mellivorinae (the [[honey badger]] or ratel), and Taxideinae (the [[American badger]]); the respective [[genus|genera]] are ''[[Arctonyx]]'', ''[[Meles (genus)|Meles]]'', ''[[Melogale]]'', ''[[Mellivora]]'' and ''[[Taxidea]]''. Badgers include the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] mustelids; the American badger is the most basal of all, followed successively by the ratel and Melinae; the estimated split dates are about 17.8, 15.5 and 14.8 million years ago, respectively.<ref name=\"Law-2018\" /> The two species of Asiatic [[stink badger]]s of the genus ''Mydaus'' were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family (Mephitidae).<ref name = \"Goswami2010\">{{cite book|author1= Goswami, Anjali  |author2= Friscia, Anthony  |lastauthoramp=yes | title= Carnivoran Evolution: New Views on Phylogeny, Form and Function| date= 2010| publisher= Cambridge University Press| isbn= 978-0-521-73586-5|page= 30|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HPw0C2i8QXkC&pg=PA30}}</ref>\n\nBadger [[mandibular condyle]]s connect to long cavities in their skulls, which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911, p. 188\">{{EB1911 |mode=cs2 |inline=1 |wstitle=Badger |volume=3 |page=188 }}</ref> This in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side, but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most [[mammal]]s.\n\nBadgers have rather short, wide bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated, weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger's tail can be {{convert|46|-|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, grey bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light-coloured underbellies. They grow to around {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length including tail.\n\nThe European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger, and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter.

The character Frances in [[Russell Hoban]]'s children's books, beginning with ''Bedtime for Frances'' (1948\u20131970), is depicted as a badger. Trufflehunter is a heroic badger in the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|''Chronicles of Narnia'']] book ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' (1951) by [[C. S.

A badger god is featured in ''[[The Immortals (series)|The Immortals]]'' (1992\u20131996) by [[Tamora Pierce]] and \"The Badger\" is a comic book hero created by [[Mike Baron]]. The badger is the emblem of the [[Hufflepuff]] house of the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] book series (1997\u20132007), it is chosen as such because the badger is an animal that is often underestimated, because it lives quietly until attacked, but which, when provoked, can fight off animals much larger than itself, which resembles the Hufflepuff house in several ways.\n\nMany other stories featuring badgers as characters include [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s children's novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' (1908), [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Mr. Tod]]'' (1912; featuring badger Tommy Brock), the [[Rupert Bear]] adventures by Mary Tourtel (appearing since 1920), [[T.

In the historic novel ''[[Incident at Hawk's Hill]]'' (1971) by [[Allan W.

The 1973 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', depicts the character of [[Friar Tuck]] as a badger.

Badgers include the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] mustelids; the American badger is the most basal of all, followed successively by the ratel and Melinae; the estimated split dates are about 17.8, 15.5 and 14.8 million years ago, respectively.<ref name=\"Law-2018\" /> The two species of Asiatic [[stink badger]]s of the genus ''Mydaus'' were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family (Mephitidae).<ref name = \"Goswami2010\">{{cite book|author1= Goswami, Anjali  |author2= Friscia, Anthony  |lastauthoramp=yes | title= Carnivoran Evolution: New Views on Phylogeny, Form and Function| date= 2010| publisher= Cambridge University Press| isbn= 978-0-521-73586-5|page= 30|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HPw0C2i8QXkC&pg=PA30}}</ref>\n\nBadger [[mandibular condyle]]s connect to long cavities in their skulls, which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911, p. 188\">{{EB1911 |mode=cs2 |inline=1 |wstitle=Badger |volume=3 |page=188 }}</ref> This in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side, but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most [[mammal]]s.\n\nBadgers have rather short, wide bodies, with short legs for digging.

They were said to lie down at the entrance of the hole holding a stick in their mouths, while other badgers piled dirt on their bellies. Two badgers would then take hold of the stick in the badger's mouth, and drag the animal loaded with dirt away, almost in the fashion of a wagon.<ref>[http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast4721.htm \"Medieval Bestiary : Badger\"]. ''bestiary.ca''.</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century poem \"The Badger\" by [[John Clare]] describes a badger hunt and [[badger-baiting]]. The character Frances in [[Russell Hoban]]'s children's books, beginning with ''Bedtime for Frances'' (1948\u20131970), is depicted as a badger. Trufflehunter is a heroic badger in the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|''Chronicles of Narnia'']] book ''[[Prince Caspian]]'' (1951) by [[C. S. Lewis]].\n\nBadger characters are featured in author [[Brian Jacques]]' ''[[Redwall]]'' series (1986\u20132011), most often falling under the title of Badger Lord or Badger Mother. A badger god is featured in ''[[The Immortals (series)|The Immortals]]'' (1992\u20131996) by [[Tamora Pierce]] and \"The Badger\" is a comic book hero created by [[Mike Baron]]. The badger is the emblem of the [[Hufflepuff]] house of the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] book series (1997\u20132007), it is chosen as such because the badger is an animal that is often underestimated, because it lives quietly until attacked, but which, when provoked, can fight off animals much larger than itself, which resembles the Hufflepuff house in several ways.\n\nMany other stories featuring badgers as characters include [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s children's novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' (1908), [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Mr. Tod]]'' (1912; featuring badger Tommy Brock), the [[Rupert Bear]] adventures by Mary Tourtel (appearing since 1920), [[T. H. White]]'s Arthurian fantasy novels ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' (1958, written 1938\u201341) and ''[[The Book of Merlyn]]'' (1977), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (1970) by [[Roald Dahl]], [[Richard Adams]]'s ''[[Watership Down]]'' (1972), [[Colin Dann]]'s ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (book)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]'' (1979), and [[Erin Hunter]]'s ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' (appearing since 2003). In the historic novel ''[[Incident at Hawk's Hill]]'' (1971) by [[Allan W. Eckert]] a badger is one of the main characters.\n\nBadgers are also featured in films and animations: a [[flash video]] called [[Badgers (animation)|Badgers]] shows a cete doing [[calisthenics]]. The 1973 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', depicts the character of [[Friar Tuck]] as a badger. In the ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'' series, Dennis the handyman, was a badger.\n\nIn Europe, badgers were traditionally used to predict the length of winter.<ref>Yoder, Don (2003) ''Groundhog Day''.

There are many common, national issues, but each sector faces unique challenges and has specific RD&E needs, which vary greatly around Australia. In developing the National RD&E Strategy and the Corporation's RD&E Plan, the FRDC has consulted widely with a majority of these groups and has undertaken industry research to build on knowledge gained through consultation. \nTo ensure a balanced portfolio, and to align with industry research priorities, the large majority of project applications are reviewed by the RACs.

Most of the industry's business environments are made more complex by their dependence on access to natural resources that are publicly managed in the interests of present and future generations. Australian fishing comprises three main sectors:\n* commercial sector, consisting of wild catch fishing, aquaculture and through-chain activities undertaken by seafood importers, processors, manufacturers, handlers and retailers\n* recreational fishing, which includes the tackle, tour guides and charter sectors\n* indigenous customary fishers.{{sfn|FRDC RD&E plan, 2010|p=13}}\nLegislatively, the \"fishing industry\" is defined in the FRDC Regulations 1991, issued under the PIERD Act 1989, as \"any industry or activity carried on in or from Australia concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or selling of fish or fish products\".\n\nThe commercial sector comprises approximately 120 wild-catch fisheries and 70 aquaculture species. Commercial seafood and marine products (e.g., pearls) were valued at $2.2 billion in 2008\u201309. The recreational sector has 3.4 million participants, who were estimated in a 2001 survey to expend $1.9&nbsp;billion annually on their fishing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participate in commercial and recreational fishing, as well practising customary fishing. The legal rights around indigenous customary fishing are being refined over time and some aspects are now part of existing legislation and court decisions.\nIn 2009\u201310, 11,431 people were employed in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry, with 7646 employed in the fishing, hunting and trapping sector and 3785 in aquaculture enterprises. Compared with 2008\u201309, total employment in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry increased by 24 per cent (2208 people) following a 30 per cent increase (1931 people) in full-time employment and a 10 per cent (277 people) increase in people engaged in part-time employment in 2009\u201310.\nDemand for seafood is rising in Australia because of increasing affluence and increasing awareness of seafood's prominent role in a healthy diet. In Asian markets consumption is also increasing with the growth of the middle class, especially in China and India. This will place demands on the supply of the limited resource, leading to increases in price.\nCurrently Australia's commercial seafood production only provides about 28 per cent of domestic demand. In part because of the rising value of the Australian dollar, the commercial sector is now re-orienting towards better serving the Australian market. Increasingly, value chains will encompass both domestic and imported product. Other factors, such as further improvements in fisheries management and better utilisation of catch, will also be important in meeting domestic demand.<ref>{{cite book | last=ABARES | title= Australian fisheries statistics 2010 | date=2011| url =http://data.daff.gov.au/brs/data/warehouse/pe_abares20110830.01/AustFishStats_2010.pdf | publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences |location=Canberra |pp=16\u201319}}</ref>\n\n'''Australian commercial fisheries and aquaculture production 2010-11'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign = \"top\"\n!  ! style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" | !! style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" |2006-07 !! style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" |2007-08 !! style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" |2008-09 !!style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" | 2009-10 !!style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" | Change\n|- valign = \"top\"\n| Wild-catch sector || $1.5bn (188,488t) || $1.38bn (181,601t)|| $1.4bn (173,142t) || $1.3bn (171,512t) || $: -1.0) <br /> t: -0.9%\n|- valign = \"top\"\n| Aquaculture sector || $806m (60,142t) || $869m (64,032t) || $867m (70,092t) || $870m (73,542t) || $: +0.3% <br /> t: +4.9%\n|- valign = \"top\"\n| Overall production || $2.21bn (248,481t) || $2.21bn (240,479t) || $2.21bn (237,508t) || $2.18bn (241,123t) || $: -1.3% <br /> t: +1.5%\n|}\n\nIt is not only seafood for consumption that the Australian industry produces.

The FRDC achieves this through coordinating investment by government and industry, and involving stakeholders to set and address RD&E priorities. The FRDC also monitors and evaluates the adoption of RD&E outputs to inform future decisions.{{sfn| FRDC RD&E plan,|2010|p=ix}}\n\n== Governance ==\n\nFormed as a statutory corporation on 2 July 1991 under the provisions of the ''Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989'' (the PIERD Act), the FRDC is responsible to the [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)]].\n\nA Chairman and a board of directors govern the FRDC; the Executive Director leads the corporation's business activities on a day-to-day basis. The board oversees corporate governance, sets strategic direction and monitors the ongoing performance of the Corporation and the Executive Director. The board and the Executive Director are responsible for managing and evaluating the Corporation and its investments, and for reporting to government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors. During 2012-13 the focus for the FRDC Board was on:\n* implementing the National Framework for Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension\n* developing strategic investment options to ensure delivery of outcomes against the FRDC RD&E Plan\n* responding to findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the rural research and development corporations and the Rural Research and Development Council's National Strategic Investment Plan\n* developing a plan to improve the perception of the fishing and aquaculture through making research results more publicly available and addressing factually incorrect media (and similar) reports.<ref>{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= FRDC annual operational plan 2012\u201313 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/AOP-2012-13.pdf |location=Canberra |p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe FRDC supports a network of Research Advisory Committees (RACs) located in each state and the Northern Territory.

A significant proportion of funding is therefore directed to research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}\n\n===Investment strategy===\nThe FRDC invests in RD&E across the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, and for the benefit of both recreational and indigenous customary fishers. The FRDC seeks to achieve maximum leverage from its investment by providing research administration and services using a value-adding model in which research projects are tailored to deliver a specific outcome and are actively managed and monitored. \nThe FRDC commissions RD&E through a variety of flexible investment approaches, including an open call for project applications; formal partnership agreements with industry sectors; subprograms and coordination programs that are tailored to a specific industry sector or activity; short-term tactical research investment; and specifically targeted commissioned RD&E, especially where there is market failure by private investment.\nThe focus for FRDC investment aligns with the following 14 themes, as outlined in the Corporation's 2010-2015 Strategic RD&E Plan.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=8}} The investment balance between themes, which may vary depending on strategic needs, is reported in each annual report.{{sfn| FRDC annual report 2012\u20132013 | p=9}}\n\n'''FRDC strategic research themes'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsable\"\n! style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" |Programs\n! style=\"background:#d0e5f5\" |Themes\n|- valign = \"top\"\n| Environment || \n1.

There are many common, national issues, but each sector faces unique challenges and has specific RD&E needs, which vary greatly around Australia. In developing the National RD&E Strategy and the Corporation's RD&E Plan, the FRDC has consulted widely with a majority of these groups and has undertaken industry research to build on knowledge gained through consultation. \nTo ensure a balanced portfolio, and to align with industry research priorities, the large majority of project applications are reviewed by the RACs.

Most of the industry's business environments are made more complex by their dependence on access to natural resources that are publicly managed in the interests of present and future generations. Australian fishing comprises three main sectors:\n* commercial sector, consisting of wild catch fishing, aquaculture and through-chain activities undertaken by seafood importers, processors, manufacturers, handlers and retailers\n* recreational fishing, which includes the tackle, tour guides and charter sectors\n* indigenous customary fishers.{{sfn|FRDC RD&E plan, 2010|p=13}}\nLegislatively, the \"fishing industry\" is defined in the FRDC Regulations 1991, issued under the PIERD Act 1989, as \"any industry or activity carried on in or from Australia concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or selling of fish or fish products\".\n\nThe commercial sector comprises approximately 120 wild-catch fisheries and 70 aquaculture species. Commercial seafood and marine products (e.g., pearls) were valued at $2.2 billion in 2008\u201309. The recreational sector has 3.4 million participants, who were estimated in a 2001 survey to expend $1.9&nbsp;billion annually on their fishing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participate in commercial and recreational fishing, as well practising customary fishing. The legal rights around indigenous customary fishing are being refined over time and some aspects are now part of existing legislation and court decisions.\nIn 2009\u201310, 11,431 people were employed in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry, with 7646 employed in the fishing, hunting and trapping sector and 3785 in aquaculture enterprises. Compared with 2008\u201309, total employment in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry increased by 24 per cent (2208 people) following a 30 per cent increase (1931 people) in full-time employment and a 10 per cent (277 people) increase in people engaged in part-time employment in 2009\u201310.\nDemand for seafood is rising in Australia because of increasing affluence and increasing awareness of seafood's prominent role in a healthy diet.
