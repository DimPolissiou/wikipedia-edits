The Tigers played their home games at [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] (nicknamed Death Valley) in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and competed in the West Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) where they were led by their third-year head coach [[Ed Orgeron]].\n\nLSU began the year ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]], and were projected to finish in second in the SEC West behind [[2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers secured an undefeated regular season that included wins over top-ten-ranked teams [[2019 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]], [[2019 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and Alabama. In the [[2019 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], LSU defeated [[2019 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] to win their first conference title since [[2011 LSU Tigers football team|2011]]. LSU was ranked No. 1 in the final [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]] of the season, earning them a spot in the national semi-final game to be played at the [[2019 Peach Bowl|Peach Bowl]]. They dominated fourth-ranked [[2019 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in that game, 63\u201328, to advance to the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship|CFP Championship Game]]. There, they defeated the defending national champions [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], 42\u201325, to secure LSU's fourth claimed national title in school history, the second undefeated champion in the CFP era, and the second 15\u20130 season among any team in the modern era. Owing to their dominant performance against a historically difficult schedule, several pundits have called the team the greatest in college football history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collegefootballnews.com/2020/01/lsu-greatest-season-ever-college-football-150-national-championship-all-time-season-rankings/8|title=LSU Greatest Season Ever?

Conference]]. LSU won in a rout, 55\u20133. \n\nLSU received the opening kick-off, and scored touchdowns on each of their first five possessions. In the first quarter, the Tigers scored via a 13-yard pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Ja'Marr Chase]], a one-yard run by [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]], and a nine-yard pass from Burrow to [[Justin Jefferson]]. To start the second quarter, they scored with two touchdown passes from Burrow to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]], first from eight yards out and then from three yards out. Georgia Southern converted a 47-yard field goal with 5:13 left in the second quarter for their only points of the day. In the final minute of the first half, Burrow threw his fifth touchdown pass of the day, and third to Marshall Jr., from 11 yards out. This tied the LSU school record for single-game touchdown passes.

This was LSU's 16th conference championship in school history, its 12th in the Southeastern Conference, and first since [[2011 LSU Tigers football team|2011]].\n\nAfter a Georgia punt on the game's opening possession, LSU opened the scoring with a 23-yard touchdown pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Ja'Marr Chase]]. LSU scored again late in the first quarter after a Georgia missed field goal attempt with a seven-yard pass from Burrow to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]] Georgia got on the board early in the second quarter with a 39-yard field goal by [[Rodrigo Blankenship]]. LSU's Cade York converted his own field goal, from 41 yards out, with 2:22 remaining in the half. Georgia's next possession ended in a [[Jake Fromm]] interception to [[Derek Stingley Jr.]], but LSU's 48-yard field goal attempt missed with 14 seconds to go kept the score at 17\u20133 LSU at half-time.\n\nLSU's opening possession of the second half ended with a 28-yard field goal by York, and Georgia's ensuing possession resulted in a 37-yard miss by Blankenship. LSU then quickly widened its lead with an 80-yard drive that included a 71-yard pass from Burrow to [[Justin Jefferson]] and ended with a four-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to Marshall Jr., followed by another interception of Fromm by Stingley Jr., and then an eight-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to Jefferson to make the score 34\u20133 at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Georgia scored its only touchdown via a two-yard pass from Fromm to [[George Pickens]], and LSU scored with a 50-yard field goal by York to end the scoring at 37\u201310.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=401132981|title=Georgia vs. LSU \u2013 Play-By-Play|website=ESPN.com|date=December 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJoe Burrow's performance, with 349 passing yards, four touchdowns, 41 rushing yards, and a 16-yard reception, was described by the Associated Press as \"completing his Heisman Trophy coronation\".

football season]]. The Tigers played their home games at [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] (nicknamed Death Valley) in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and competed in the West Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) where they were led by their third-year head coach [[Ed Orgeron]].\n\nLSU began the year ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]], and were projected to finish in second in the SEC West behind [[2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers secured an undefeated regular season that included wins over top-ten-ranked teams [[2019 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]], [[2019 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and Alabama. In the [[2019 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], LSU defeated [[2019 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] to win their first conference title since [[2011 LSU Tigers football team|2011]]. LSU was ranked No. 1 in the final [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]] of the season, earning them a spot in the national semi-final game to be played at the [[2019 Peach Bowl|Peach Bowl]]. They dominated fourth-ranked [[2019 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in that game, 63\u201328, to advance to the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship|CFP Championship Game]]. There, they defeated the defending national champions [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], 42\u201325, to secure LSU's fourth claimed national title in school history, the second undefeated champion in the CFP era, and the second 15\u20130 season among any team in the modern era. Owing to their dominant performance against a historically difficult schedule, several pundits have called the team the greatest in college football history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collegefootballnews.com/2020/01/lsu-greatest-season-ever-college-football-150-national-championship-all-time-season-rankings/8|title=LSU Greatest Season Ever?

He was accompanied on offense by 1,400-yard running back [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]], and two 1,500-yard receivers [[Ja'Marr Chase]] and [[Justin Jefferson]], the former winning the [[Biletnikoff Award]] as the best wide receiver in the country. LSU's defense was anchored by two All-American defensive backs in [[Jim Thorpe Award]] winner [[Grant Delpit]] and true freshman [[Derek Stingley Jr.]] Linebacker [[Jacob Phillips]] led the SEC in tackles.

Conference]]. LSU won in a rout, 55\u20133. \n\nLSU received the opening kick-off, and scored touchdowns on each of their first five possessions. In the first quarter, the Tigers scored via a 13-yard pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Ja'Marr Chase]], a one-yard run by [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]], and a nine-yard pass from Burrow to [[Justin Jefferson]]. To start the second quarter, they scored with two touchdown passes from Burrow to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]], first from eight yards out and then from three yards out. Georgia Southern converted a 47-yard field goal with 5:13 left in the second quarter for their only points of the day. In the final minute of the first half, Burrow threw his fifth touchdown pass of the day, and third to Marshall Jr., from 11 yards out. This tied the LSU school record for single-game touchdown passes. Burrow was given one possession at the start of the second half to try and break the record, but the drive ended in a 39-yard field goal, and Burrow sat the remainder of the game. Backup quarterback Myles Brennan led another touchdown drive in the third quarter, ending in a two-yard touchdown run by Lanard Fournette. In the fourth quarter, kicker Cade York converted a 48-yard field goal to end the scoring for the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=401110725|title=Georgia Southern vs. LSU \u2013 Play-By-Play|website=ESPN.com|date=August 31, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Ga Southern AP\">{{cite web |title=Burrow throws for 5 TDs, No. 6 LSU beats Ga.

In the second quarter, Texas took the lead with a 55-yard touchdown pass from [[Sam Ehlinger]] to Brennan Eagles. LSU responded with a six-yard touchdown pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Justin Jefferson]]. With 1:41 left in the half, LSU added three points with a 33-yard field goal. Texas was forced to punt on its next possession, and LSU scored another touchdown in the final minute of the half with a 21-yard pass from Burrow to Jefferson. The score was 20\u20137 LSU at half-time.\n\nOn Texas's first drive of the second half, they scored on a 19-play, 86-yard drive that ended with a two-yard run by Sam Ehlinger. This was the first of nine consecutive scoring possessions by the two teams. LSU scored next with a 40-yard field goal by York. Texas responded with a 20-yard touchdown pass from Ehlinger to Jake Smith to bring the score to 23\u201321 LSU. On the first play of the fourth quarter, LSU's Joe Burrow completed a 26-yard touchdown pass to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]] Texas pulled within two points again when Ehlinger completed a 44-yard touchdown pass to [[Devin Duvernay]].

The game was played at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]], mirroring LSU's previous appearances in national championship games in [[2012 BCS National Championship Game|2012]], [[2008 BCS National Championship Game|2008]], and [[2004 Sugar Bowl|2004]].

Clemson opened the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run by quarterback [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]]. LSU evened the score with a 52-yard touchdown pass from [[Joe Burrow]] to [[Ja'Marr Chase]]. Early in the second quarter, Clemson regained the lead with a 52-yard field goal by B.T. Potter, and then extended the lead on their next possession with a 36-yard touchdown pass from Lawrence to [[Tee Higgins]]. LSU scored touchdowns on their next three possessions to close out the first half: first on a three-yard run by Burrow, then a 14-yard pass from Burrow to Chase, and then a six-yard pass from Burrow to [[Thaddeus Moss]] with 10 seconds remaining in the half. The score was 28\u201317 LSU at half-time.\n\nIn the third quarter, Clemson pulled within three with a three-yard touchdown run by [[Travis Etienne]] and a successful two-point conversion via a pass from Lawrence to Amari Rodgers. LSU extended the lead with a four-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to Moss late in the quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, LSU scored again, with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Burrow to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]] to make the score 42\u201325.

This was LSU's fourth claimed national title in school history, and first since the [[2007 LSU Tigers football team|2007 season]]. It was their first undefeated season since [[1958 LSU Tigers football team|1958]], and the second ever 15\u20130 season by any FBS team in the modern era (after Clemson the previous season).

One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial, from the jury.<ref>{{cite news|title= Matlock \u2013 The First Season |work=[[DVD Talk]]|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32891/matlock-the-first-season/|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Since 1991, reruns of the show have been shown in syndication and on [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]], [[INSP (TV channel)|INSP]], [[Hallmark Channel]], [[CBS Drama]], [[WGN America]], [[FETV]] and [[MeTV]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe show centers on widower [[Ben Matlock|Benjamin Leighton \"Ben\" Matlock]] (played by [[Andy Griffith]]), a renowned, folksy and popular though cantankerous attorney.  Usually, at the end of the case, the person who is on the stand being questioned by Matlock is the actual perpetrator, and Matlock will expose him/her, despite making clear that his one goal is to prove [[reasonable doubt]] in the case of his client's [[Guilt (law)|guilt]] or to prove his client's innocence.\n\nMatlock studied law at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], and after several years as a public defender, established his law practice in [[Atlanta]], living in a modest farmhouse in a neighboring suburb. He is known to visit crime scenes to discover clues otherwise overlooked and come up with viable, alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder). Matlock also has conspicuously finicky fashion sense; he generally appears in court wearing a trademark light gray suit and, over the series' entire run, owned three generations of the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]]\u2014always an all-gray model (Griffith's character had always driven Ford products in his 1960s series, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'').\n\nMatlock is noted for his thrift and a fondness for hot dogs. In episode 158 (\"The Diner\"), hot dogs are revealed to have been his favorite dish since he was a young man. In contrast, after the series ended, his penchant for hot dogs was explained in the 1997 episode \"Murder Two\" of Joyce Burditt's ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''. Matlock blames [[List of Diagnosis: Murder characters#Mark Sloan|Dr. Mark Sloan]] (played by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) for recommending a disastrous investment in [[Stereo 8|8-track cartridges]], in which he lost his savings of $5,000 in 1969, forcing him into wearing cheap suits and living on hot dogs.\n\nDespite his thrift, Matlock's standard fee is $100,000, usually paid up front, but if he or his staff believe strongly enough in the innocence of a client, or if the client is unable to pay immediately (if at all), he has them pay over time, or reduces the fee significantly or waives it entirely, albeit reluctantly in some cases. He also, reluctantly, takes a ''[[pro bono]]'' case occasionally.

Matlock also employed Tyler Hudson (played by [[Kene Holliday]]), a stock market whiz, as a [[private investigator]]. Tyler would often go undercover for Matlock in various guises to gather information. Matlock's most frequent prosecutorial adversary was Nebraska native Julie March (played by [[Julie Sommars]]). Although the two had a professional rivalry\u2014with Julie being a prosecutor and Matlock a defense lawyer\u2014their relationship outside of court was very cordial and the two often spent time together outside of court with occasional flirtations.\n\nToward the end of the first season, Matlock also took on Cassie Phillips (played by [[Kari Lizer]]), a cocky young law student, as an office worker. After the first season ended, Linda Purl departed from the series and lawyer-daughter Charlene was written out of the series by having moved to [[Philadelphia]] to start her own law practice. To begin the second season, Matlock went to England to try a case and met Michelle Thomas (played by [[Nancy Stafford]]), a young American lawyer living in [[London]]. After the case was over, Michelle followed Matlock back to the U.S. and took over Charlene's role as his law partner. Cassie stayed on as a file clerk until the end of the season, when she disappeared for reasons never made clear. With Lizer's departure, Julie Sommars then became a regular cast member.\n\n[[File:Matlock cast season 2 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of season 2, ''from left'': ''(top)'' [[Kene Holliday]], [[Julie Sommars]]; ''(bottom)'' [[Kari Lizer]], [[Andy Griffith|Griffith]], [[Nancy Stafford]]]]\nSeveral actors appeared in the series as different characters prior to becoming regular cast members. In season one's \"The Seduction,\" Nancy Stafford played the role of Caryn Nelson/Carole Nathan, a high-class prostitute, who was paid off for [[perjury]] against Matlock's client. Also in that season, in \"The Angel,\" Kari Lizer had her first appearance as Matlock's client, Margaret Danello, a pop star called \"Angel.\" Also, actor Daniel Roebuck played a young physician, Dr. Bobby Shaw in \"The Doctors,\" then, lawyer Alex Winthrop in season three's 2-part episode: \"The Ambassador,\" and \"The Priest\", and a prosecutor in a 2-pt episode: \"The Assassination,\" before later becoming a cast regular playing Cliff Lewis in season seven.\n\nSome actors appeared as a different character in each appearance on the show. For example, [[Carolyn Seymour]] played Christina Harrison Ward in season one (\"The Affair\", episode 4), Dr. Vanessa Sedgwick in season two (\"The Genius\", episode 20), and Iris Vogel in season three (\"The Psychic\", episode 13). [[Nana Visitor]] and [[Roddy McDowall]] made several guest appearances as well.\n\nAfter season three, Kene Holliday was fired. Matlock hired a young, former [[North Carolina]] deputy sheriff, Conrad McMasters (played by [[Clarence Gilyard, Jr.]]), to be his new [[detective|private detective]]. Like Tyler, Conrad would also go undercover to gather information about cases. However, the two characters were different in their personalities and approach to the job. Tyler was a stocktrader and carried himself with something of an aristocratic air, whereas Conrad had more of a blue collar, working man attitude.  Matlock and McMasters became good friends as they were alike in many ways. Also during this period, [[Don Knotts]], Andy Griffith's old co-star as Deputy Barney Fife on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]],'' began making frequent appearances as \"Ace\" Calhoun, Matlock's annoying next-door neighbor.\n\nBefore Brynn Thayer appeared in the 1992 episode \"The Vacation\" as Ben Matlock's other (and to that point unmentioned) daughter Leanne MacIntyre, who had become a prosecutor in [[Philadelphia]] and who had married and divorced, she first appeared in an earlier season's story \"The Suspect\", in 1991, in which she played Roxanne Windemere, a character with whom Ben became smitten. She joined the cast full-time in the season of 1992 playing a similar role to Linda Purl's character of lawyer-daughter Charlene of the first season (sister to Thayer's character Leanne McIntyre). Daniel Roebuck now joined Thayer as a new regular for season seven, playing the role of ne'er-do-well Cliff Lewis, a young lawyer and associate.  [[Warren Frost]] also joined the cast in a recurring role as Cliff's father Billy, an old nemesis from Matlock's past, as Ben had stood his sister up at the altar to pursue his law degree.\n\nThe move that year of 1992, now being telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for the last three seasons to 1995, caused a fair amount of cast turnover as Nancy Stafford now left the series to spend more time with her husband, and Julie Sommars soon followed, although she would play a recurring role in several occasional later episodes, while [[Don Knotts|Don Knotts']] character was cut from the series. Clarence Gilyard Jr. remained on, but with the addition of Roebuck to the cast as the character Cliff Lewis, his role was diminished somewhat. After season seven, Gilyard left to play [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Jimmy Trivette on the new series ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' with star [[Chuck Norris]].\n\n''Matlock'' had largely become, like Silverman and Hargrove's ''[[Perry Mason]]'' older TV series revival, a \"movie-of-the-week\" type series by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith's advancing age, as he was nearing age 70 and wanted to spend more time with his family. Before that season, Brynn Thayer departed from the series and Leanne was mysteriously never heard from again. In season nine [[Carol Huston]] joined the series as Jerri Stone, a secondary private investigator helping out Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad McMasters, Jerri and Matlock had shared hobbies including singing.\n\nCoinciding with the move to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network was also a change in filming venues. After taping in [[California]] for its entire previous run on [[NBC]], requiring Griffith to commute from his longtime home in [[North Carolina]] to the West Coast, ABC moved production to the [[EUE Screen Gems Studios|DEG Film Studios]] in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] to ease the travel burden on Griffith. Many viewers and media critics lauded the new atmosphere of different geographical locations and \"out-of-Hollywood\" venues breathing some new life into the crime/lawyer/legal/court scenes. The ''[[Perry Mason]]''-style of \"[[whodunit]]\" format was also adjusted to a more [[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]] TV series-style \"[[howcatchem]]\" format.\n\nAlthough never officially confirmed, a widespread rumor suggests that the character of Ben Matlock was based on colorful lawyer [[Bobby Lee Cook]], known as the \"dean of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] criminal defense attorneys.\" Cook, whose practice is based not in Atlanta but in a small mountain town, has been an attorney since the 1940s and has gained an international reputation for his success in criminal and civil cases.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Matlock episodes}}\n''Matlock'' aired a total of 193 episodes across nine seasons and began with a TV-movie. Twelve two-hour and fifteen two-part episodes of the program were aired. Six of the episodes were clip shows with mostly minor plots that paved the way for scenes from previous stories. Although, numerically, Griffith appeared in more episodes portraying Sheriff Andy Taylor in ''The Andy Griffith Show'', he logged more on-screen time as Ben Matlock due to the length of each show.\n{{:List of Matlock episodes}}\n\n==Program format==\nA few changes were made in the format of the introduction of the episodes. The introduction of characters was essentially the same, the only changes being the actors for each season. Andy Griffith, Linda Purl, Kene Holliday, Nancy Stafford, Clarence Gilyard Jr., Brynn Thayer, Julie Sommars, Kari Lizer, Daniel Roebuck, and Carol Huston were all featured in the intros for their seasons.\n\nThe ''Matlock'' commercial screen also changed. The early episodes had a scene of Ben Matlock in front of a brown screen; around 1987, this was changed to gray. In 1992, this was changed once again to the same gray, but with a blue square around the \"M\" in \"Matlock\". Later in the 1993\u201394 season, the commercial screen was removed.\n\n===Spinoffs===\n''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'' was a spin-off on CBS, based on a character who originated in \"The Don\" (1986) a two-part ''Matlock'' episode from season one. [[William Conrad]] played prosecutor James L. McShane and [[Joe Penny]] played Paul Baron, the son of Matlock's client. Executive producers [[Fred Silverman]] and [[Dean Hargrove]] were responsible for both ''Matlock'' and ''Jake and the Fatman'', as well as ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', created by Joyce Burditt (which itself was a spin-off of ''Jake and the Fatman'') in 1993, also on CBS; ''[[Father Dowling Mysteries]]'' in 1988 on NBC and ABC; and the 30 ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' made-for-TV movies from 1985 until 1995 on NBC.\n\n===In popular culture===\n\nThe series is a favorite of [[Homer Simpson]]'s father [[Abe Simpson|Abe]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In [[Whacking Day|one episode]] Abe Simpson says, \"I'm an old man. I hate everything but ''Matlock''.\" Part of this quote was adopted as a song title by [[Finnish people|Finnish]] band [[Liimanarina]].<ref name=\"Cox, 2015\">{{cite

produced by Intermedia Entertainment Company (first season only), The [[Fred Silverman]] Company, [[Dean Hargrove]] Productions, and [[Viacom Productions]], originally aired from  March 3, 1986 to May 8, 1992 on [[NBC]]; and from November 5, 1992 until May 7, 1995 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nThe show's format is similar to that of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (with both ''Matlock'' and the 1980s  ''Perry Mason'' TV movies  created by [[Dean Hargrove]]), with Matlock identifying the perpetrators and then confronting them in dramatic courtroom scenes. One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial, from the jury.<ref>{{cite news|title= Matlock \u2013 The First Season |work=[[DVD Talk]]|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/32891/matlock-the-first-season/|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Since 1991, reruns of the show have been shown in syndication and on [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]], [[INSP (TV channel)|INSP]], [[Hallmark Channel]], [[CBS Drama]], [[WGN America]], [[FETV]] and [[MeTV]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe show centers on widower [[Ben Matlock|Benjamin Leighton \"Ben\" Matlock]] (played by [[Andy Griffith]]), a renowned, folksy and popular though cantankerous attorney.  Usually, at the end of the case, the person who is on the stand being questioned by Matlock is the actual perpetrator, and Matlock will expose him/her, despite making clear that his one goal is to prove [[reasonable doubt]] in the case of his client's [[Guilt (law)|guilt]] or to prove his client's innocence.\n\nMatlock studied law at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], and after several years as a public defender, established his law practice in [[Atlanta]], living in a modest farmhouse in a neighboring suburb. He is known to visit crime scenes to discover clues otherwise overlooked and come up with viable, alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder). Matlock also has conspicuously finicky fashion sense; he generally appears in court wearing a trademark light gray suit and, over the series' entire run, owned three generations of the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Crown Victoria|Crown Victoria]]\u2014always an all-gray model (Griffith's character had always driven Ford products in his 1960s series, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'').\n\nMatlock is noted for his thrift and a fondness for hot dogs. In episode 158 (\"The Diner\"), hot dogs are revealed to have been his favorite dish since he was a young man. In contrast, after the series ended, his penchant for hot dogs was explained in the 1997 episode \"Murder Two\" of Joyce Burditt's ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''. Matlock blames [[List of Diagnosis: Murder characters#Mark Sloan|Dr. Mark Sloan]] (played by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) for recommending a disastrous investment in [[Stereo 8|8-track cartridges]], in which he lost his savings of $5,000 in 1969, forcing him into wearing cheap suits and living on hot dogs.\n\nDespite his thrift, Matlock's standard fee is $100,000, usually paid up front, but if he or his staff believe strongly enough in the innocence of a client, or if the client is unable to pay immediately (if at all), he has them pay over time, or reduces the fee significantly or waives it entirely, albeit reluctantly in some cases. He also, reluctantly, takes a ''[[pro bono]]'' case occasionally. These traits, and the demands he placed upon his investigators, are often points of comic relief in the series.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Matlock characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Andy Griffith]] as [[Ben Matlock]]\n* [[Linda Purl]] (Lori Lethin in pilot) as Charlene Matlock (season 1), Ben's younger daughter who became a partner to her father before she moved to Philadelphia to set up her own law practice\n* [[Alice Hirson]] as Hazel (pilot), Matlock's secretary\n* [[Kene Holliday]] as Tyler Hudson (seasons 1\u20133), Ben's first private investigator\n* [[Kari Lizer]] as Cassie Phillips (season 2), Ben's young file clerk who desired to become partner after Charlene's departure\n* [[Nancy Stafford]] as Michelle Thomas (seasons 2\u20136), an American lawyer living in London who becomes an equal partner to Matlock\n* [[Julie Sommars]] as Julie March (seasons 3\u20136), a district attorney who becomes a good friend to Ben Matlock\n* [[Clarence Gilyard|Clarence Gilyard Jr.]] as Conrad McMasters (seasons 4\u20137), Ben's second private investigator who is a former deputy sheriff and a rodeo rider\n* [[Brynn Thayer]] as Leanne MacIntyre (seasons 7\u20138), Ben's older daughter who works for her father after Michelle's departure\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Cliff Lewis (seasons 7\u20139), Ben's last partner and private investigator who graduated from law school, the son of Ben's childhood friend, Billy Lewis\n* [[Carol Huston]] as Jerri Stone (season 9), Ben's last assistant and private investigator with a talent for singing lullabies\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James McEachin]] as Lieutenant Frank Daniels (season 1), Ben's contact on the [[Atlanta Police Department]]\n* [[Michael Durrell]] as District Attorney Lloyd Burgess (seasons 1\u20136), chief district attorney for [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]]\n* [[David Froman]] as Lieutenant Bob Brooks (seasons 1\u20136), Ben's contact on the [[Atlanta Police Department]]\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Les \"Ace\" Calhoun (seasons 3\u20136), Ben's next-door neighbor who was once a client in season three\n* [[Warren Frost]] as Billy Lewis (seasons 6\u20139), Ben's childhood friend and Cliff's father\n\n==Changes==\n[[File:Matlock original cast 1986 season 1.jpg|thumb|Original cast ''(from left)'': [[Kene Holliday]], [[Andy Griffith]], and [[Linda Purl]]]]\nOriginally, the series premiered with Ben Matlock having a law practice with his daughter Charlene (played originally by Lori Lethin in the pilot movie; Linda Purl took over the role when the series went to air in the first season).

She joined the cast full-time in the season of 1992 playing a similar role to Linda Purl's character of lawyer-daughter Charlene of the first season (sister to Thayer's character Leanne McIntyre). Daniel Roebuck now joined Thayer as a new regular for season seven, playing the role of ne'er-do-well Cliff Lewis, a young lawyer and associate.  [[Warren Frost]] also joined the cast in a recurring role as Cliff's father Billy, an old nemesis from Matlock's past, as Ben had stood his sister up at the altar to pursue his law degree.\n\nThe move that year of 1992, now being telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for the last three seasons to 1995, caused a fair amount of cast turnover as Nancy Stafford now left the series to spend more time with her husband, and Julie Sommars soon followed, although she would play a recurring role in several occasional later episodes, while [[Don Knotts|Don Knotts']] character was cut from the series. Clarence Gilyard Jr. remained on, but with the addition of Roebuck to the cast as the character Cliff Lewis, his role was diminished somewhat. After season seven, Gilyard left to play [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Jimmy Trivette on the new series ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' with star [[Chuck Norris]].\n\n''Matlock'' had largely become, like Silverman and Hargrove's ''[[Perry Mason]]'' older TV series revival, a \"movie-of-the-week\" type series by season nine. Part of the reason for this was Griffith's advancing age, as he was nearing age 70 and wanted to spend more time with his family. Before that season, Brynn Thayer departed from the series and Leanne was mysteriously never heard from again. In season nine [[Carol Huston]] joined the series as Jerri Stone, a secondary private investigator helping out Cliff in his duties. Like Conrad McMasters, Jerri and Matlock had shared hobbies including singing.\n\nCoinciding with the move to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network was also a change in filming venues. After taping in [[California]] for its entire previous run on [[NBC]], requiring Griffith to commute from his longtime home in [[North Carolina]] to the West Coast, ABC moved production to the [[EUE Screen Gems Studios|DEG Film Studios]] in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] to ease the travel burden on Griffith. Many viewers and media critics lauded the new atmosphere of different geographical locations and \"out-of-Hollywood\" venues breathing some new life into the crime/lawyer/legal/court scenes. The ''[[Perry Mason]]''-style of \"[[whodunit]]\" format was also adjusted to a more [[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]] TV series-style \"[[howcatchem]]\" format.\n\nAlthough never officially confirmed, a widespread rumor suggests that the character of Ben Matlock was based on colorful lawyer [[Bobby Lee Cook]], known as the \"dean of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] criminal defense attorneys.\" Cook, whose practice is based not in Atlanta but in a small mountain town, has been an attorney since the 1940s and has gained an international reputation for his success in criminal and civil cases.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Matlock episodes}}\n''Matlock'' aired a total of 193 episodes across nine seasons and began with a TV-movie. Twelve two-hour and fifteen two-part episodes of the program were aired. Six of the episodes were clip shows with mostly minor plots that paved the way for scenes from previous stories. Although, numerically, Griffith appeared in more episodes portraying Sheriff Andy Taylor in ''The Andy Griffith Show'', he logged more on-screen time as Ben Matlock due to the length of each show.\n{{:List of Matlock episodes}}\n\n==Program format==\nA few changes were made in the format of the introduction of the episodes. The introduction of characters was essentially the same, the only changes being the actors for each season. Andy Griffith, Linda Purl, Kene Holliday, Nancy Stafford, Clarence Gilyard Jr., Brynn Thayer, Julie Sommars, Kari Lizer, Daniel Roebuck, and Carol Huston were all featured in the intros for their seasons.\n\nThe ''Matlock'' commercial screen also changed. The early episodes had a scene of Ben Matlock in front of a brown screen; around 1987, this was changed to gray. In 1992, this was changed once again to the same gray, but with a blue square around the \"M\" in \"Matlock\". Later in the 1993\u201394 season, the commercial screen was removed.\n\n===Spinoffs===\n''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'' was a spin-off on CBS, based on a character who originated in \"The Don\" (1986) a two-part ''Matlock'' episode from season one. [[William Conrad]] played prosecutor James L. McShane and [[Joe Penny]] played Paul Baron, the son of Matlock's client. Executive producers [[Fred Silverman]] and [[Dean Hargrove]] were responsible for both ''Matlock'' and ''Jake and the Fatman'', as well as ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', created by Joyce Burditt (which itself was a spin-off of ''Jake and the Fatman'') in 1993, also on CBS; ''[[Father Dowling Mysteries]]'' in 1988 on NBC and ABC; and the 30 ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' made-for-TV movies from 1985 until 1995 on NBC.\n\n===In popular culture===\n\nThe series is a favorite of [[Homer Simpson]]'s father [[Abe Simpson|Abe]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In [[Whacking Day|one episode]] Abe Simpson says, \"I'm an old man. I hate everything but ''Matlock''.\" Part of this quote was adopted as a song title by [[Finnish people|Finnish]] band [[Liimanarina]].<ref name=\"Cox, 2015\">{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Carolyn|title=[Insert Grampa Simpson Joke Here]: LA Times Writer Calls for Millennials to Take #MillennialPledge, Says We Need a Spanking|url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-la-times-is-grampa-simpson/|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=The Mary Sue|date=October 12, 2015|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Seitz, 2012\">{{cite news|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller|title=Andy Griffith: The No Muss, No Fuss Performer You Were Always Glad To See|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/andy-griffith-obit.html|accessdate=7 August 2017|work=Vulture|date=3 July 2012|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n\n===DVD releases===\n[[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has released all nine seasons of ''Matlock'' on DVD in Region 1.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, CBS released ''Matlock: The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Matlock-The-Complete-Series/20654 \"52-DVD 'Complete Series' Set from CBS/Paramount is on the Way!\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121002846/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Matlock-The-Complete-Series/20654 |date=2015-01-21 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!DVD name\n!Ep #\n!Release date\n|-\n| The First Season\n| align=\"center\"|25\n| April 8, 2008\n|-\n| The Second Season\n| align=\"center\"|24\n| January 13, 2009\n|-\n| The Third Season\n| align=\"center\"|20\n| July 7, 2009\n|-\n| The Fourth Season\n| align=\"center\"|24\n| March 2, 2010\n|-\n| The Fifth Season\n| align=\"center\"|22\n| July 20, 2010\n|-\n| The Sixth Season\n| align=\"center\"|22\n| January 25, 2011\n|-\n| The Seventh Season\n| align=\"center\"|18\n| February 21, 2012\n|-\n| The Eighth Season\n| align=\"center\"|22\n| February 12, 2013\n|-\n| The Ninth and Final Season\n| align=\"center\"|18\n| July 16, 2013\n|-\n| The Complete Series\n| align=\"center\"|195\n| April 7, 2015\n|}\n\n===Streaming===\nSeason one of the series was made available for streaming through [[Amazon Video]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B8C7PVQ Amazon Video: Matlock] Retrieved February 20, 2013</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Television}}\n*{{Portal-inline| United States}}\n* {{Portal-inline|Law}}\n* {{Portal-inline|1980s}}\n* {{Portal-inline|1990s}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0090481|title=Matlock}}\n* {{tv.com show|matlock|Matlock}}\n* [http://www.tagsrwc.com/matlock/ Andy Griffith as Ben Matlock] An unofficial ''Matlock'' website\n* [https://archive.is/20130208213504/http://www.tvacres.com/char_matlock_ben.htm Ben Matlock at TV Acres] A page dedicated to Ben Matlock, including notable case synopses and list of ''Simpsons'' quotes\n\n[[Category:1986 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1995 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American comedy-drama television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American comedy-drama television series]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:1980s American legal television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American legal television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:Television shows filmed in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Matlock (TV series)]]\n", "name_user": "Glenn L", "label": "safe", "comment": "Linked Lori Lethin", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series)"}

The film stars [[Prithviraj Sukumaran]] in the lead role, with [[Prakash Raj]], [[Mamta Mohandas]], [[Wamiqa Gabbi]], and Master Alok in other important roles. The film marks the first regional Indian film production and distribution of Sony Pictures and the debut of [[Prithviraj Productions]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Prithviraj takes big steps, announces collaboration with Sony Pictures|url=https://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/2018/03/17/prithviraj-takes-big-steps-announces-collaboration-with-sony-pictures.html|publisher=Onmanorama}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, a global crisis arises when a [[comet]] passes very close to the Earth for 9 days. How this affects [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] Albert Lewis and his son Adam's life forms the story. ''9'' was released in India and [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] territories on 7 February 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Albert Lewis is a widowed [[astrophysicist]] living with his son Adam. A comet from an unknown galaxy is projected to pass beside Earth which will cause a huge [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) surge and is predicted to be lasting nine days. Albert's mentor Dr. Inayat Khan asks him to conduct research about the comet and sends him to the [[Himalayas]]. Inayat also says to Albert that this incident is long portrayed by the locals over there and their caves have drawing of the comet with its earlier and future occurrences. Albert, with his colleagues and son, goes to the Himalayas for the research and Albert and Adam opts to stay at the cottage with a janitor (Hakka) to assist them.\n\nOn Albert's first viewing of the passing comet, he meets Eva, and brings her home. Adam gets friendly with her. Though Hakka is suspicious, Eva, as a guest, lingers around Albert. Adam finds out that there is something peculiar about Eva. It appears that Eva is some kind of an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial entity]] that haunts on tragic memories and their causes and came along with the comet.\n\nAs it happens, Albert believes Adam is the cause of his separation with wife. The entity feeds on this and targets Adam. Meanwhile, Albert meets with monks of a monastery and tries to understand the comet more. The alien entity reveals its true colors to Adam, Divya, a colleague of Albert's, and Hakka. These all happens unbeknownst to Albert. Adam tries to communicate the facts he knows about Eva to Albert. But Albert does not believe any of it and considers it to be pretext of some repressed Adam's fear.\n\nEventually on one night, Eva subdues Albert as Annie, his long lost wife and asks Albert to hand Adam over to her as he is the one who ended up splitting them two. Albert prevails and pushes away Eva and runs to save Adam. They drive away from the cottage to move away from Eva and any potential harm. Albert hands-over Adam to Sandeep and goes back to the cottage to confront Eva and put an end to all of this. Though he does not find her there. As night approaches, Adam suggest to Sandeep to take him to the monastery. En route Sandeep is attacked by Eva and Adam seeks refuge amongst a local tribe whose premises are protected by enchantments. In the night Albert comes and takes Adam with him and Adam wakes just in time to run away from danger. Albert follows but is knocked out by Eva.\n\nAlbert wakes up meeting Inayat sitting next to him, who tells him that Eva was an illusion, a version of his own self who dislikes his son and Albert is suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Inayat asks whereabouts about Adam who is missing. Albert attempts to find where his son is and approaches the monastery, they ask him to retrace back through his memories because there is time. Albert retraces the footsteps from the night before and ends up finding Eva. After conversing with her in terms of his love to Adam, she transfigures into Annie and points him to a direction. Albert reaches at the cave with paintings which Khan mentioned that an ancient depiction of the arrival of the comet and in local tribes understanding a demon. As he finds Adam there alone and safe, he becomes happy. Albert reconciles with Adam and asks whether Eva was real or not.\n\nDuring the mid credits, there is a scene inside the cave where Albert found Adam, inside the cave there are paintings of the last comet arrival depicting the incident happened 2000 years ago, at last camera focus on a painting that leaves the people to deduce whether Eve is real or a symbol of darkness within Albert.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Prithviraj Sukumaran]] as Dr. Albert Lewis<ref>{{cite news|title=Prithviraj in Jenuse's 9|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/mollywood/240318/prithviraj-in-jenuses-9.html|publisher=Deccan Chronicle}}</ref>\n** [[Vishal Krishna (child actor)|Master Vishal Krishna]]  as Young Albert\n*[[Mamta Mohandas]] as Annie Albert Lewis\n*Master Alok as Adam\n*[[Prakash Raj]] as Dr. Inayat Khan\n*[[Wamiqa Gabbi]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Godha heroine to return to Malayalam alongside Prithviraj|url=http://english.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/movie-news/godha-heroine-to-return-to-malayalam-alongside-prithviraj-1.2807766|publisher=Mathrubhumi}}</ref> as Eva \n*Amalda Liz as Divya\n*Uday Chandra as Hakka\n*[[Tony Luke]] as Sandeep Murthy<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Luke plays a geek scientist in Prithviraj's Nine|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/tony-luke-plays-a-geeky-scientist-in-prithvirajs-nine/articleshow/67449422.cms|publisher=Times Of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Luke in Prithviraj movie Nine 9 after Pranav Mohanlal Aadhi Movie|url=https://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/actor-tony-luke-in-prithviraj-movie-nine-9-after-pranav-mohanlal-s-aadi-movie--1.3466153|publisher=Mathrubhumi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Movie Nine 9 trailer released|url= https://www.ibtimes.co.in/prithvirajs-nine-trailer-released-social-media-users-allege-illuminati-connection-789634 |publisher=IBTimes}}</ref>\n*[[Rahul Madhav]] as James\n*[[Adil Ibrahim]] as Doctor Rahul, Albert's friend\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn 6 November 2016, ''[[The Times of India]]'' reported that Jenuse Mohamed is set to direct an untitled [[science fiction]] horror thriller film written by himself, with [[Prithviraj Sukumaran]] signed to play the lead role.

How this affects [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] Albert Lewis and his son Adam's life forms the story. ''9'' was released in India and [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] territories on 7 February 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Albert Lewis is a widowed [[astrophysicist]] living with his son Adam. A comet from an unknown galaxy is projected to pass beside Earth which will cause a huge [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) surge and is predicted to be lasting nine days. Albert's mentor Dr. Inayat Khan asks him to conduct research about the comet and sends him to the [[Himalayas]]. Inayat also says to Albert that this incident is long portrayed by the locals over there and their caves have drawing of the comet with its earlier and future occurrences. Albert, with his colleagues and son, goes to the Himalayas for the research and Albert and Adam opts to stay at the cottage with a janitor (Hakka) to assist them.\n\nOn Albert's first viewing of the passing comet, he meets Eva, and brings her home. Adam gets friendly with her. Though Hakka is suspicious, Eva, as a guest, lingers around Albert. Adam finds out that there is something peculiar about Eva. It appears that Eva is some kind of an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial entity]] that haunts on tragic memories and their causes and came along with the comet.\n\nAs it happens, Albert believes Adam is the cause of his separation with wife. The entity feeds on this and targets Adam. Meanwhile, Albert meets with monks of a monastery and tries to understand the comet more. The alien entity reveals its true colors to Adam, Divya, a colleague of Albert's, and Hakka. These all happens unbeknownst to Albert. Adam tries to communicate the facts he knows about Eva to Albert. But Albert does not believe any of it and considers it to be pretext of some repressed Adam's fear.\n\nEventually on one night, Eva subdues Albert as Annie, his long lost wife and asks Albert to hand Adam over to her as he is the one who ended up splitting them two. Albert prevails and pushes away Eva and runs to save Adam. They drive away from the cottage to move away from Eva and any potential harm. Albert hands-over Adam to Sandeep and goes back to the cottage to confront Eva and put an end to all of this. Though he does not find her there. As night approaches, Adam suggest to Sandeep to take him to the monastery. En route Sandeep is attacked by Eva and Adam seeks refuge amongst a local tribe whose premises are protected by enchantments. In the night Albert comes and takes Adam with him and Adam wakes just in time to run away from danger. Albert follows but is knocked out by Eva.\n\nAlbert wakes up meeting Inayat sitting next to him, who tells him that Eva was an illusion, a version of his own self who dislikes his son and Albert is suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Inayat asks whereabouts about Adam who is missing. Albert attempts to find where his son is and approaches the monastery, they ask him to retrace back through his memories because there is time. Albert retraces the footsteps from the night before and ends up finding Eva. After conversing with her in terms of his love to Adam, she transfigures into Annie and points him to a direction. Albert reaches at the cave with paintings which Khan mentioned that an ancient depiction of the arrival of the comet and in local tribes understanding a demon. As he finds Adam there alone and safe, he becomes happy. Albert reconciles with Adam and asks whether Eva was real or not.\n\nDuring the mid credits, there is a scene inside the cave where Albert found Adam, inside the cave there are paintings of the last comet arrival depicting the incident happened 2000 years ago, at last camera focus on a painting that leaves the people to deduce whether Eve is real or a symbol of darkness within Albert.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Prithviraj Sukumaran]] as Dr. Albert Lewis<ref>{{cite news|title=Prithviraj in Jenuse's 9|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/mollywood/240318/prithviraj-in-jenuses-9.html|publisher=Deccan Chronicle}}</ref>\n** [[Vishal Krishna (child actor)|Master Vishal Krishna]]  as Young Albert\n*[[Mamta Mohandas]] as Annie Albert Lewis\n*Master Alok as Adam\n*[[Prakash Raj]] as Dr. Inayat Khan\n*[[Wamiqa Gabbi]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Godha heroine to return to Malayalam alongside Prithviraj|url=http://english.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/movie-news/godha-heroine-to-return-to-malayalam-alongside-prithviraj-1.2807766|publisher=Mathrubhumi}}</ref> as Eva \n*Amalda Liz as Divya\n*Uday Chandra as Hakka\n*[[Tony Luke]] as Sandeep Murthy<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Luke plays a geek scientist in Prithviraj's Nine|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/tony-luke-plays-a-geeky-scientist-in-prithvirajs-nine/articleshow/67449422.cms|publisher=Times Of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Luke in Prithviraj movie Nine 9 after Pranav Mohanlal Aadhi Movie|url=https://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/actor-tony-luke-in-prithviraj-movie-nine-9-after-pranav-mohanlal-s-aadi-movie--1.3466153|publisher=Mathrubhumi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Movie Nine 9 trailer released|url= https://www.ibtimes.co.in/prithvirajs-nine-trailer-released-social-media-users-allege-illuminati-connection-789634 |publisher=IBTimes}}</ref>\n*[[Rahul Madhav]] as James\n*[[Adil Ibrahim]] as Doctor Rahul, Albert's friend\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn 6 November 2016, ''[[The Times of India]]'' reported that Jenuse Mohamed is set to direct an untitled [[science fiction]] horror thriller film written by himself, with [[Prithviraj Sukumaran]] signed to play the lead role.

Arenas started 30 games and averaged 10.9 points per game for the Warriors, who finished in last place in the Western Conference that season.

Arenas was selected for his first [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]]. He guided the team to a 45-win season and its first playoff berth since 1997. Arenas led the team in scoring with 25.5 ppg, finishing seventh in the league in that category.
