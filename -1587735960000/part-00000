In October 2002, he joined the [[United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine]].\n\n== Family ==\nBlokhin's father, Vladimir Ivanovich Blokhin, is a native of [[Moscow]], a veteran of the [[World War II]], survivor of the [[Leningrad blockade]], and a former Soviet law enforcement agent. Vladimir Blokhin later worked as a sports functionary for the Soviet Dynamo Society. Blokhin's mother Katerina Zakharivna (''n\u00e9e'' Adamenko) is from a village in the [[Borodyanka Raion]]. She originally worked at a Kyiv sewing factory, but eventually discovered hidden athletic talents and became the Soviet champion in [[track and field]] as well as pentathlon. After retiring from sports, she became a staff member at one of Kyiv's universities.\n\nBlokhin was married to [[Irina Deriugina]], a top coach and former world champion in [[rhythmic gymnastics]], but the couple divorced in the early 1990s. Blokhin and Deriugina have a daughter, singer [[Iryna Blokhina]], who wrote and performed the Euro 2012 anthem.<ref>[http://tabloid.pravda.com.ua/news/4ebd28fd5427b/ \u0414\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0456\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0430\u0454 \u0433\u0456\u043c\u043d \"\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e-2012\" (The daughter of Blokhin will sing the Euro 2012 anthem)] with photo.

She is portrayed by actress [[Jennifer Lien]]. Set in the 24th century of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the series follows the crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']], stranded far from home and struggling to get back to Earth. Kes is a member of the Ocampa (a [[telepathy|telepathic]] alien species with an average life expectancy of nine years) who joins the crew in the series' premiere episode along with her Talaxian boyfriend, [[Neelix]]. She subsequently works as [[The Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|the Doctor]]'s medical assistant and develops her mental abilities with [[Tuvok]]'s assistance.\n\nKes' storylines focus on her relationships with Neelix, the Doctor, Tuvok, [[Tom Paris]], and [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]]. Her psionic powers are also central and secondary themes of some episodes. Lien was removed from the series in the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4)|fourth season]], but reprised her role in a [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 6)|season six]] episode, \"[[Fury (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fury]]\". Kes has been featured in [[Star Trek canon|non-canon]] [[List of Star Trek novels|novels and short stories]] adapted from the show.\n\nCritical response to Kes was mostly negative, though some critics praised Lien's performance. Although Kes' relationship with Neelix was panned, critics had a more mixed-to-positive reaction to her friendships with Tuvok and Tom Paris. Kes' relationships with members of ''Voyager's'' crew and her psionic powers attracted attention from academics.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Creation and casting ===\nEarly development of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', including the Ocampa, began in July 1993. Producers initially imagined the Ocampa as an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] alien species. In later meetings, they agreed on the idea of the Ocampa having a short lifespan, similar to a [[mayfly]]. Kes was intended to live for only seven years, and changes in her appearance were planned for each season, emphasizing her age progression.<ref name=\"Book11\">[[Kes (Star Trek)#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: pp. 175-177</ref> The androgyny concept was dropped, as the first cast description identified Kes, who was initially named ''Dah'', as a female.<ref name=\"Book4\">[[Kes (Star Trek)#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 208</ref> Producers proposed a second Ocampa, shown near the end of his lifespan, as part of the main cast, though this idea was abandoned in favor of [[Neelix]], who was a late addition to the series.<ref name=\"Book11\" /> Kes was initially created as a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] for ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]''{{'s}} journey through the [[Delta Quadrant]],<ref name=\"Book11\" /> before Neelix assumed the role instead.<ref name=\"Book4\" /> Kes was then reimagined as a [[medical intern]].<ref name=\"Book4\" /> In an August 1993 memo, series creator [[Jeri Taylor]] suggested Kes have a [[Superhuman abilities|superhuman ability]] and be caught in a war between two factions.<ref name=\"Book12\">[[Kes (Star Trek)#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 189</ref><ref name=\"Book13\">[[Kes (Star Trek)#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 191</ref> Producers debated the nature of the character's [[Psionics|psionic powers]], leading them to ask production associate Zayra Cabot and the Joan Pearce Research Associates to gather information on [[parapsychology]].<ref name=\"AdditionalBookSource1\">[[Kes (Star Trek)#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 199</ref> They later agreed to portray Kes with \"some measure of telepathic ability\" for the pilot episode (\"[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]\"), and planned to address it further in future episodes.<ref name=\"AdditionalBookSource2\">[[Kes (Star Trek)#Poe1998|Poe (1998)]]: p. 206</ref>\n[[File:Star Trek Voyager costume - Kes.jpg|thumb|An image of one of Kes' costumes and her prosthetics|alt=]]\n\nWhen casting Kes, \"Caretaker\" director [[Winrich Kolbe]] looked for an actress who was \"fragile, but with a steely will underneath\".

Prior the show's pilot episode, Kes lived with her people in an underground city constructed by a [[Nacene]] alien known as the Caretaker. He had cared for the Ocampa since inadvertently destroying their planet's ecosystem and atmosphere thousands of years ago; the Ocampa became completely insular and dependent upon him. The Caretaker had sealed the city away from the planet's surface to protect the Ocampa; however, Kes dreamed of leaving the Ocampa enclave to explore the galaxy and develop her psionic powers, with which her ancestors were rumored to have far more proficiency. Finding a way to Ocampa's surface, she was captured and tortured by the [[Kazon]] who hope to gain access to the Ocampa city and its resources; Neelix, a Talaxian, rescued her, and they became a couple.<ref name=\"2019ep17\">{{cite episode|title=[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]|series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]|credits=Director: [[Winrich Kolbe]], Story: [[Rick Berman]], [[Michael Piller]], and [[Jeri Taylor]], Teleplay: Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=January 16, 1995|season=1}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Caretaker realizes he is dying, he abducts beings from the [[Alpha Quadrant]] in the hopes of finding a compatible mate with whom to produce offspring to ensure someone can continue protecting and caring for the Ocampa.

When the Kazon attack and attempt to steal the Caretaker's technology, Janeway orders the destruction of his vessel.

She is portrayed by actress [[Jennifer Lien]]. Set in the 24th century of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the series follows the crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']], stranded far from home and struggling to get back to Earth. Kes is a member of the Ocampa (a [[telepathy|telepathic]] alien species with an average life expectancy of nine years) who joins the crew in the series' premiere episode along with her Talaxian boyfriend, [[Neelix]]. She subsequently works as [[The Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|the Doctor]]'s medical assistant and develops her mental abilities with [[Tuvok]]'s assistance.\n\nKes' storylines focus on her relationships with Neelix, the Doctor, Tuvok, [[Tom Paris]], and [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]]. Her psionic powers are also central and secondary themes of some episodes. Lien was removed from the series in the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 4)|fourth season]], but reprised her role in a [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 6)|season six]] episode, \"[[Fury (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fury]]\". Kes has been featured in [[Star Trek canon|non-canon]] [[List of Star Trek novels|novels and short stories]] adapted from the show.\n\nCritical response to Kes was mostly negative, though some critics praised Lien's performance. Although Kes' relationship with Neelix was panned, critics had a more mixed-to-positive reaction to her friendships with Tuvok and Tom Paris. Kes' relationships with members of ''Voyager's'' crew and her psionic powers attracted attention from academics.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Creation and casting ===\nEarly development of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', including the Ocampa, began in July 1993. Producers initially imagined the Ocampa as an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] alien species. In later meetings, they agreed on the idea of the Ocampa having a short lifespan, similar to a [[mayfly]].
