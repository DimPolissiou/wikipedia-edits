Its development cannot be attributed to any individual; rather, it is a [[natural language]] that developed organically over time.<ref name=\"Bellis\" />\n\n==Recognition and status==\nAuslan was [[Recognition of sign languages|recognised]] by the [[Australian government]] as a \"community language other than English\" and the preferred language of the Deaf community in policy statements in 1987<ref name=\"LoBianco\" /> and 1991.<ref name=\"Dawkins\" /> However, this recognition has yet to filter through to many institutions, government departments and professionals who work with Deaf people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nThe emerging status of Auslan has gone hand-in-hand with the advancement of the Deaf community in Australia, beginning in the early 1980s. In 1982, the registration of the first sign language [[interpreters]] by [[NAATI]],<ref name=\"Flynn\" /> a newly established regulatory body for interpreting and translating, accorded a sense of legitimacy to Auslan, furthered by the publishing of the first [[dictionary]] of Auslan in 1989. Auslan began to emerge as a language of instruction for Deaf students in secondary schools in the 1990s \u2014 mainly through the provision of interpreters in mainstream (hearing) schools with deaf support units. Boosted by the 1992 enactment of the federal [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Australia)|Disability Discrimination Act]], sign language interpreters are also increasingly provided in tertiary education.\n\nToday there is a growing number of courses teaching Auslan as a [[second language]], from an elective language subject offered by some secondary schools to a two-year full-time diploma at [[TAFE]].\n\nThough becoming more and more visible, Auslan is still rarely seen at public events or on television; there are, for example, no interpreted news services. There is a regular program on [[Community television in Australia|community television]] station [[C31 Melbourne|Channel 31]] in [[Melbourne]], \"Deaf TV\", which is entirely in Auslan and is produced by Deaf volunteers.\n\n===Prominent advocates for Auslan===\nIn 2006 [[David Gibson (Australian politician)|David Gibson]] was the first member of any Parliament in Australia to give a maiden speech in Auslan and was involved in Auslan events for the National Week of Deaf People at the Queensland Parliament, including the use of Auslan interpreters for question time and a debate between members of the deaf community and members of parliament on disability issues in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/deaf-community-invited-to-parliament-20071017-14st.html|title=Deaf community invited to parliament|date=17 October 2007|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220121510/http://www.smh.com.au/national/deaf-community-invited-to-parliament-20071017-14st.html|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Young Australian of the Year]] for 2015, [[Drisana Levitzke-Gray]], is a strong proponent of Auslan and, in her acceptance speech using Auslan, called on the [[Government of Australia]], and Australians, to learn and use Auslan as a [[natural language]], as a [[human right]] for Australians.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-02/drisana-levitzke-gray-gives-deaf-australia-a-voice/6063320|title=Young Australian of the Year Drisana Levitzke-Gray gives deaf Australians a voice|last=Wynne|first=Emma|date=2 February 2015|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903030758/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-02/drisana-levitzke-gray-gives-deaf-australia-a-voice/6063320|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=live|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{BANZSL family tree}}\n[[Image:Thomas Pattison.jpg|thumb|Thomas Pattison, early Deaf educator]]\nAuslan evolved from sign languages brought to Australia during the nineteenth century from Britain and Ireland. The earliest record of a deaf Australian was convict [[Elizabeth Steel]], who arrived in 1790 on the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] ship \"Lady Juliana\".<ref name=\"Branson\" /> There is as yet no historical evidence, however, that she used a sign language. The first known signing Deaf immigrant was the engraver John Carmichael<ref name=\"Carty\" /> who arrived in Sydney in 1825 from [[Edinburgh]]. He had been to a Deaf school there, and was known as a good storyteller in sign language.\n\nThirty-five years later, in 1860, a school for the Deaf was established by another Deaf Scotsman, Thomas Pattison \u2014  the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]] in [[New South Wales]]. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] just a few weeks later, the [[Victorian College for the Deaf]] was founded by a Deaf Englishman, [[Frederick J Rose]], who had been educated at the [[Old Kent Road School]] in [[London]]. These schools and others had an enormous role in the development of Auslan, as they were the first contact with sign language for many Deaf children.  Because they were residential [[boarding school]]s, they provided ample opportunity for the language to thrive, even though in many schools, signing was banned from the classroom for much of the 20th century.\n\n[[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) also had an influence on the development of Auslan, as it was used in Catholic schools until the 1950s. The first Catholic school for Deaf children was established in 1875 by Irish nuns. Unlike [[British Sign Language]], ISL uses a one-handed alphabet originating in [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), and although this alphabet has now almost disappeared from Australia, some initialised signs from the Irish alphabet can still be seen.\n\nIn more recent times Auslan has seen a significant amount of [[Loanword|lexical borrowing]] from [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), especially in signs for technical terms. Some of these arose from the [[signed English]] educational philosophies of the 1970s and 80s, when a committee looking for signs with direct equivalence to English words found them in ASL and/or in invented English-based signed systems used in North America and introduced them in the classroom. ASL contains many signs initialised from an alphabet which was also derived from LSF, and Auslan users, already familiar with the related ISL alphabet, accepted many of the new signs easily.\n\n==Auslan in relation to English==\nIt is sometimes wrongly assumed that [[English-speaking countries]] share a sign language.  Auslan is a [[natural language]] distinct from spoken or written [[English language|English]]. Its grammar and vocabulary often do not have direct English equivalents and vice versa. However, English, as the dominant language in Australia, has had a significant influence on Auslan, especially through manual forms such as [[fingerspelling]] and (more recently) Signed English.\n\nIt is difficult to sign Auslan fluently while speaking English, as the word order is different, and there is often no direct sign-to-word equivalence. However, [[mouthing]] of an English word together with a sign may serve to clarify when one sign may have several English equivalents. In some cases the mouth gesture that accompanies a sign may not reflect the equivalent translation in English (e.g. a sign meaning \"thick\" may be accompanied by a mouthed \"fahth.\"\n\n===Fingerspelling===\n[[File:Bimanual alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|A chart showing the two-handed manual alphabet as used in British Sign Language, Australian Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language]]\nA two-handed [[manual alphabet]], identical to the one used in British Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language, is integral to Auslan. This alphabet is used for fingerspelling [[proper nouns]] such as personal or place names, [[common nouns]] for everyday objects, and English words, especially technical terms, for which there is no widely used sign. Fingerspelling can also be used for emphasis, clarification, or, sometimes extensively, by English-speaking learners of Auslan. The amount of fingerspelling varies with the context and the age of the signer. A recent small-scale study puts fingerspelled words in Auslan conversations at about 10% of all lexical items, roughly equal to ASL and higher than many other sign languages, such as New Zealand Sign Language.<ref name=\"Schembri\" /> The proportion is higher in older signers, suggesting that the use of fingerspelling has diminished over time.\n\nSchembri and Johnston (in press)<ref name=\"Schembri\" /> found that the most commonly fingerspelled words in Auslan include \"so\", \"to\", \"if\", \"but\" and \"do\".\n\nSome signs also feature an English word's initial letter as a handshape from a one- or two-handed manual alphabet and use it within a sign. For example, part of the sign for \"Canberra\" incorporates the letter \"C\".\n\n===Signed English===\n:''See main article [[Signed English]]''\nAustralasian Signed English was created in the late 1970s to represent English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was, and still is, used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for ''discussing'' English in academic contexts. It was thought to be much easier for hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than to learn a new language with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.\n\nThe use of Signed English in schools is controversial with some in the Deaf community, who regard Signed English as a contrived and unnatural artificially [[constructed language]]. Signed English has now been largely rejected by Deaf communities in Australia and its use in education is dwindling; however, a number of its signs have made their way into normal use.\n\n==Acquisition and nativeness==\nUnlike oral languages, only a minority of Deaf children acquire their language from their parents (about 4 or 5% have Deaf parents).<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> Most acquire Auslan from Deaf peers at school or later through Deaf community networks. Many learn Auslan as a \"delayed\" [[first language]] in adolescence or adulthood, after attempting to learn English (or another spoken/written language) without the exposure necessary to properly acquire it. The Deaf community often distinguish between \"oral deaf\" who grew up in an [[oralism|oral]] or [[signed English]] educational environment without Auslan, and those \"''Deaf'' Deaf\" who learnt Auslan at an early age from Deaf parents or at a Deaf school. Regardless of their background, many Deaf adults consider Auslan to be their first or [[primary language]], and see themselves as users of [[English language learning and teaching|English as a second language]].\n\n==Variation and standardisation==\nAuslan exhibits a high degree of variation, determined by the signer's age, educational background and regional origin, and the signing community is very tolerant of individual differences in signing style.\n\nThere is no [[standard dialect]] of Auslan. Standard dialects arise through the support of institutions, such as the media, education, government and the law. As this support has not existed for most sign languages, coupled with the lack of a widely used written form and communications technologies, Auslan has diverged much more rapidly than [[Australian English]].\n\nAuslan was introduced to Papua New Guinea, where it mixed with local or home sign and [[Tok Pisin]] to produce [[Papua New Guinean Sign Language]].\n\n===Dialects===\nLinguists often regard Auslan as having two major [[dialects]] - Northern ([[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]), and Southern ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]], and [[Western Australia]]). The vocabulary of the two dialects differs significantly, with different signs used even for very common concepts such as colours, animals, and days of the week; differences in grammar appear to be slight.\n\nThese two dialects may have roots in older dialectal differences from the United Kingdom, brought over by Deaf immigrants who founded the first schools for the Deaf in Australia \u2014 English varieties (from London) in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] and Scottish ones (from Edinburgh) in [[Sydney]], although the relationship between lexical variation in the UK and Australia appears much more complicated than this (some Auslan signs appear similar to signs used in the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] variety of BSL, for example). Before schools were established elsewhere, Deaf children attended one of these two initial schools, and brought signs back to their own states. As schools opened up in each state, new signs also developed in the dormitories and playgrounds of these institutions. As a result, Auslan users can identify more precise regional varieties (e.g., \"Sydney sign\", \"Melbourne sign\", \"Perth sign\", \"Adelaide sign\" and \"Brisbane sign\"). In a conversation between two strangers, one from Melbourne and the other from Perth, it is likely that one will use a small number of signs unfamiliar to the other, despite both belonging to the same \"southern dialect\". Signers can often identify which school someone went to, even within a few short utterances.\n\nDespite these differences, communication between Auslan users from different regions poses little difficulty for most Deaf Australians, who often become aware of different regional vocabulary as they grow older, through travel and Deaf community networks, and because Deaf people are so well practised in bridging barriers to communication.\n\n==Indigenous Australian sign languages and Auslan==\n{{main|Australian Aboriginal sign languages}}\nA number of [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] sign languages exist, unrelated to Auslan, such as [[Warlpiri Sign Language]]. They occur in the southern, central, and western desert regions, coastal [[Arnhem Land]], some islands of the north coast, the western side of [[Cape York Peninsula]], and on some [[Torres Strait Islands]]. They have also been noted as far south as the [[Murray River]].\n\nDeaf Indigenous people of [[Far North Queensland]] (extending from [[Yarrabah, Queensland|Yarrabah]] to [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]]) form a distinct signing community using a [[dialect]] of Auslan;<ref name=\"Oreilly\" /> it has features of indigenous sign languages and gestural systems as well as signs and grammar of Auslan.\n\n==Written and recorded Auslan==\nAuslan has no widely used written form; in the past transcribing Auslan was largely an academic exercise. The first Auslan dictionaries used either photographs or drawings with motion arrows to describe signs; more recently,  technology has made possible the use of short video clips on [[CD-ROM]] or online dictionaries.\n\n[[SignWriting]], however, has its adherents in Australia.<ref name=\"SignPuddle\" />\n\n''[[A Silent Agreement]]'' was Australia's first theatrically-released [[feature film]] to showcase [[Australian Sign Language]] in its main [[dialogue]] and as a plot element, with some scenes depicted entirely in Auslan. There is also one scene where the characters discuss the risky [[politics]] of using non-deaf actors using [[sign language]] in film. <ref>https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/a-silent-agreement-2017/38099/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Agreement-Davo-Hardy/dp/B07RDGR4P4</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of sign languages]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n <ref name=\"Bellis\">{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/deaf.htm |title=Innovations for the Hearing Impaired |first=Mary |last=Bellis |year=2004 |publisher=About.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081107233811/http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/deaf.htm |archivedate=7 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"LoBianco\">{{cite book |last=Lo Bianco |first=Joseph |title=National Policy on Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ |year=1987 |publisher=Canberra : Australian Government Publishing Service |isbn=0-644-06118-9 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520020916/https://books.google.com/books?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ |archivedate=20 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Dawkins\">{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=John |title=Australia's language : the Australian language and literacy policy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZLxHQAACAAJ |year=1991 |publisher=Canberra : Australian Government Publishing Service |isbn=0-644-14972-8 |quote=It is now increasingly recognised that signing deaf people constitute a group like any other non-English speaking language group in Australia, with a distinct sub-culture recognised by shared history, social life and sense of identity, united and symbolised by fluency in Auslan, the principal means of communication within the Australian Deaf Community (Page 20) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520220919/https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZLxHQAACAAJ |archivedate=20 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Flynn\">{{cite web|url=https://www.asliavic.com.au/about?q=node/88 |title=A Brief History of Sign Language Interpreting in Australia |first=John W. |last=Flynn |year=2001 |publisher=Australian Sign Language Interpreters' Association Victoria |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217114510/http://www.asliavic.com.au/about?q=node%2F88 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Ross E. |last2=Karchmer |first2=Michael A. |year=2004 |title=Chasing the Mythical Ten Percent: Parental Hearing Status of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in the United States |journal=Sign Language Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=138\u2013162 |publisher=Gallaudet University Press |issn=0302-1475 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&accno=EJ747626 |doi=10.1353/sls.2004.0005 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530155202/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true |archivedate=30 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Branson\">{{cite book |last1=Branson |first1=Jan |last2=Miller |first2=Don |title=The story of Betty Steel: deaf convict and pioneer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce-yPQAACAAJ |series=Australia's deaf heritage |volume=1 |year=1995 |publisher=Deafness Resources Australia |isbn=0-646-21735-6 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506004750/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce-yPQAACAAJ |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Carty\">{{cite journal |last1=Schembri |first1=A. |last2=Napier |first2=J. |last3=Beattie |last4=Leigh |first4=G.

The first known signing Deaf immigrant was the engraver John Carmichael<ref name=\"Carty\" /> who arrived in Sydney in 1825 from [[Edinburgh]]. He had been to a Deaf school there, and was known as a good storyteller in sign language.\n\nThirty-five years later, in 1860, a school for the Deaf was established by another Deaf Scotsman, Thomas Pattison \u2014  the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]] in [[New South Wales]]. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] just a few weeks later, the [[Victorian College for the Deaf]] was founded by a Deaf Englishman, [[Frederick J Rose]], who had been educated at the [[Old Kent Road School]] in [[London]]. These schools and others had an enormous role in the development of Auslan, as they were the first contact with sign language for many Deaf children.  Because they were residential [[boarding school]]s, they provided ample opportunity for the language to thrive, even though in many schools, signing was banned from the classroom for much of the 20th century.\n\n[[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) also had an influence on the development of Auslan, as it was used in Catholic schools until the 1950s. The first Catholic school for Deaf children was established in 1875 by Irish nuns. Unlike [[British Sign Language]], ISL uses a one-handed alphabet originating in [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), and although this alphabet has now almost disappeared from Australia, some initialised signs from the Irish alphabet can still be seen.\n\nIn more recent times Auslan has seen a significant amount of [[Loanword|lexical borrowing]] from [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), especially in signs for technical terms. Some of these arose from the [[signed English]] educational philosophies of the 1970s and 80s, when a committee looking for signs with direct equivalence to English words found them in ASL and/or in invented English-based signed systems used in North America and introduced them in the classroom. ASL contains many signs initialised from an alphabet which was also derived from LSF, and Auslan users, already familiar with the related ISL alphabet, accepted many of the new signs easily.\n\n==Auslan in relation to English==\nIt is sometimes wrongly assumed that [[English-speaking countries]] share a sign language.  Auslan is a [[natural language]] distinct from spoken or written [[English language|English]]. Its grammar and vocabulary often do not have direct English equivalents and vice versa. However, English, as the dominant language in Australia, has had a significant influence on Auslan, especially through manual forms such as [[fingerspelling]] and (more recently) Signed English.\n\nIt is difficult to sign Auslan fluently while speaking English, as the word order is different, and there is often no direct sign-to-word equivalence. However, [[mouthing]] of an English word together with a sign may serve to clarify when one sign may have several English equivalents. In some cases the mouth gesture that accompanies a sign may not reflect the equivalent translation in English (e.g. a sign meaning \"thick\" may be accompanied by a mouthed \"fahth.\"\n\n===Fingerspelling===\n[[File:Bimanual alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|A chart showing the two-handed manual alphabet as used in British Sign Language, Australian Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language]]\nA two-handed [[manual alphabet]], identical to the one used in British Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language, is integral to Auslan. This alphabet is used for fingerspelling [[proper nouns]] such as personal or place names, [[common nouns]] for everyday objects, and English words, especially technical terms, for which there is no widely used sign. Fingerspelling can also be used for emphasis, clarification, or, sometimes extensively, by English-speaking learners of Auslan. The amount of fingerspelling varies with the context and the age of the signer. A recent small-scale study puts fingerspelled words in Auslan conversations at about 10% of all lexical items, roughly equal to ASL and higher than many other sign languages, such as New Zealand Sign Language.<ref name=\"Schembri\" /> The proportion is higher in older signers, suggesting that the use of fingerspelling has diminished over time.\n\nSchembri and Johnston (in press)<ref name=\"Schembri\" /> found that the most commonly fingerspelled words in Auslan include \"so\", \"to\", \"if\", \"but\" and \"do\".\n\nSome signs also feature an English word's initial letter as a handshape from a one- or two-handed manual alphabet and use it within a sign. For example, part of the sign for \"Canberra\" incorporates the letter \"C\".\n\n===Signed English===\n:''See main article [[Signed English]]''\nAustralasian Signed English was created in the late 1970s to represent English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was, and still is, used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for ''discussing'' English in academic contexts. It was thought to be much easier for hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than to learn a new language with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.\n\nThe use of Signed English in schools is controversial with some in the Deaf community, who regard Signed English as a contrived and unnatural artificially [[constructed language]]. Signed English has now been largely rejected by Deaf communities in Australia and its use in education is dwindling; however, a number of its signs have made their way into normal use.\n\n==Acquisition and nativeness==\nUnlike oral languages, only a minority of Deaf children acquire their language from their parents (about 4 or 5% have Deaf parents).<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> Most acquire Auslan from Deaf peers at school or later through Deaf community networks. Many learn Auslan as a \"delayed\" [[first language]] in adolescence or adulthood, after attempting to learn English (or another spoken/written language) without the exposure necessary to properly acquire it. The Deaf community often distinguish between \"oral deaf\" who grew up in an [[oralism|oral]] or [[signed English]] educational environment without Auslan, and those \"''Deaf'' Deaf\" who learnt Auslan at an early age from Deaf parents or at a Deaf school. Regardless of their background, many Deaf adults consider Auslan to be their first or [[primary language]], and see themselves as users of [[English language learning and teaching|English as a second language]].\n\n==Variation and standardisation==\nAuslan exhibits a high degree of variation, determined by the signer's age, educational background and regional origin, and the signing community is very tolerant of individual differences in signing style.\n\nThere is no [[standard dialect]] of Auslan. Standard dialects arise through the support of institutions, such as the media, education, government and the law. As this support has not existed for most sign languages, coupled with the lack of a widely used written form and communications technologies, Auslan has diverged much more rapidly than [[Australian English]].\n\nAuslan was introduced to Papua New Guinea, where it mixed with local or home sign and [[Tok Pisin]] to produce [[Papua New Guinean Sign Language]].\n\n===Dialects===\nLinguists often regard Auslan as having two major [[dialects]] - Northern ([[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]), and Southern ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]], and [[Western Australia]]). The vocabulary of the two dialects differs significantly, with different signs used even for very common concepts such as colours, animals, and days of the week; differences in grammar appear to be slight.\n\nThese two dialects may have roots in older dialectal differences from the United Kingdom, brought over by Deaf immigrants who founded the first schools for the Deaf in Australia \u2014 English varieties (from London) in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] and Scottish ones (from Edinburgh) in [[Sydney]], although the relationship between lexical variation in the UK and Australia appears much more complicated than this (some Auslan signs appear similar to signs used in the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] variety of BSL, for example). Before schools were established elsewhere, Deaf children attended one of these two initial schools, and brought signs back to their own states. As schools opened up in each state, new signs also developed in the dormitories and playgrounds of these institutions. As a result, Auslan users can identify more precise regional varieties (e.g., \"Sydney sign\", \"Melbourne sign\", \"Perth sign\", \"Adelaide sign\" and \"Brisbane sign\"). In a conversation between two strangers, one from Melbourne and the other from Perth, it is likely that one will use a small number of signs unfamiliar to the other, despite both belonging to the same \"southern dialect\". Signers can often identify which school someone went to, even within a few short utterances.\n\nDespite these differences, communication between Auslan users from different regions poses little difficulty for most Deaf Australians, who often become aware of different regional vocabulary as they grow older, through travel and Deaf community networks, and because Deaf people are so well practised in bridging barriers to communication.\n\n==Indigenous Australian sign languages and Auslan==\n{{main|Australian Aboriginal sign languages}}\nA number of [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] sign languages exist, unrelated to Auslan, such as [[Warlpiri Sign Language]]. They occur in the southern, central, and western desert regions, coastal [[Arnhem Land]], some islands of the north coast, the western side of [[Cape York Peninsula]], and on some [[Torres Strait Islands]]. They have also been noted as far south as the [[Murray River]].\n\nDeaf Indigenous people of [[Far North Queensland]] (extending from [[Yarrabah, Queensland|Yarrabah]] to [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]]) form a distinct signing community using a [[dialect]] of Auslan;<ref name=\"Oreilly\" /> it has features of indigenous sign languages and gestural systems as well as signs and grammar of Auslan.\n\n==Written and recorded Auslan==\nAuslan has no widely used written form; in the past transcribing Auslan was largely an academic exercise. The first Auslan dictionaries used either photographs or drawings with motion arrows to describe signs; more recently,  technology has made possible the use of short video clips on [[CD-ROM]] or online dictionaries.\n\n[[SignWriting]], however, has its adherents in Australia.<ref name=\"SignPuddle\" />\n\n''[[A Silent Agreement]]'' was Australia's first theatrically-released [[feature film]] to showcase [[Australian Sign Language]] in its main [[dialogue]] and as a plot element, with some scenes depicted entirely in Auslan. There is also one scene where the characters discuss the risky [[politics]] of using non-deaf actors using [[sign language]] in film. <ref>https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/a-silent-agreement-2017/38099/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Agreement-Davo-Hardy/dp/B07RDGR4P4</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of sign languages]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n <ref name=\"Bellis\">{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/deaf.htm |title=Innovations for the Hearing Impaired |first=Mary |last=Bellis |year=2004 |publisher=About.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081107233811/http://inventors.about.com/od/hstartinventions/a/deaf.htm |archivedate=7 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"LoBianco\">{{cite book |last=Lo Bianco |first=Joseph |title=National Policy on Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ |year=1987 |publisher=Canberra : Australian Government Publishing Service |isbn=0-644-06118-9 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520020916/https://books.google.com/books?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ |archivedate=20 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Dawkins\">{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=John |title=Australia's language : the Australian language and literacy policy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZLxHQAACAAJ |year=1991 |publisher=Canberra : Australian Government Publishing Service |isbn=0-644-14972-8 |quote=It is now increasingly recognised that signing deaf people constitute a group like any other non-English speaking language group in Australia, with a distinct sub-culture recognised by shared history, social life and sense of identity, united and symbolised by fluency in Auslan, the principal means of communication within the Australian Deaf Community (Page 20) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520220919/https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZLxHQAACAAJ |archivedate=20 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Flynn\">{{cite web|url=https://www.asliavic.com.au/about?q=node/88 |title=A Brief History of Sign Language Interpreting in Australia |first=John W. |last=Flynn |year=2001 |publisher=Australian Sign Language Interpreters' Association Victoria |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217114510/http://www.asliavic.com.au/about?q=node%2F88 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Ross E. |last2=Karchmer |first2=Michael A. |year=2004 |title=Chasing the Mythical Ten Percent: Parental Hearing Status of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in the United States |journal=Sign Language Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=138\u2013162 |publisher=Gallaudet University Press |issn=0302-1475 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&accno=EJ747626 |doi=10.1353/sls.2004.0005 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530155202/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true |archivedate=30 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Branson\">{{cite book |last1=Branson |first1=Jan |last2=Miller |first2=Don |title=The story of Betty Steel: deaf convict and pioneer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce-yPQAACAAJ |series=Australia's deaf heritage |volume=1 |year=1995 |publisher=Deafness Resources Australia |isbn=0-646-21735-6 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506004750/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce-yPQAACAAJ |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n <ref name=\"Carty\">{{cite journal |last1=Schembri |first1=A. |last2=Napier |first2=J. |last3=Beattie |last4=Leigh |first4=G.

One, contracted out to The Martin Company, used radio-isotopic decay as the power source for its generators; these plants were given odd-numbered SNAP designations beginning with SNAP-1. The other project used nuclear reactors to generate energy, and was developed by the [[Atomics International|Atomics International Division]] of [[North American Aviation]].

The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a retaining band anchored by an [[Pyrotechnic fastener|explosive bolt]]. When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe [[eutectic]] sodium-potassium ([[NaK]]) alloy was used as a coolant in the SNAP-10A. The NaK was circulated through the core and thermoelectric converters by a [[Electromagnetic pump|liquid metal direct current conduction-type]] pump. The thermoelectric converters (identified as the long white \"apron\") are doped silicon germanium materials, thermally coupled, but electrically isolated from the NaK heat transfer medium. The temperature difference between the NaK on one side of the thermoelectric converter and the cold of space on the other created an electric potential and usable electricity.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schmidt | first = G.L. | title = SNAP 10A Test Program | publisher = Rockwell International, Canoga Park, California | date = September 1988 | pages = | url = | id = DCN: SP-100-XT-0002 | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n== SNAPSHOT mission==\n\n===Launch and orbital operation ===\n\nSNAP-10A was launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] by an [[Atlas-Agena|ATLAS Agena D rocket]] on 3 April 1965 into a [[low Earth orbit]] altitude of approx. 1,300&nbsp;km.

In the mid-19th century, some Anglican priests were influenced by [[John Henry Newman]] and converted to Roman Catholicism, including [[David Lewis (priest, born 1814)|David Lewis]]; [[Edmund Ffoulkes]] also converted, but later returned to Anglicanism, becoming vicar of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] in Oxford. [[John David Jenkins]], who was [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Pietermaritzburg]] for a time, was later nicknamed the \"Rail men's Apostle\" for his ministry to railway workers in Oxford. [[David Thomas (missionary priest)|David Thomas]], a priest in [[Gwynedd]], was instrumental in the foundation of a Welsh church in the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina]].\n\nSome students became ministers in other denominations of Christianity.

The film was produced by [[Munich Animation]] and released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] under the [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label. The film got [[Eberhard Junkersdorf]], the producer, a [[Bavarian Film Award]] in 1998 for \"Best Production\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Furchlosen Vier-Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119170/awards?ref_=tt_ql_op_1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe film was set in the [[Future|near future]] and based loosely on the [[folklore|folk tale]] of the \"[[Town Musicians of Bremen]]\" by the [[Brothers Grimm]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts by introducing each of the four main characters. Buster, a bloodhound, doesn't want to hunt; he wants to sing. This gets him in trouble with his master, and he ends up running away. Next we meet Fred, a donkey whose master has chosen to replace him with a robot. Fred runs away from home as well.\n\nThe third character we meet is Gwendolyn, a graceful [[Siamese cat]]. (Oddly for a Siamese, she does not have blue eyes.) Her beloved owner, Aunt Wanda, has died.  Aunt Wanda left behind two valuable jewels, but her heirs can't find them.  They decide that the cat is hiding them, and try to kill her. She escapes, taking with her a lute which she has learned to play.\n\nBuster and Fred each like to sing, and they decide to travel to a big city in order to see if they can become famous singers. They plan to go to [[Paris]], but because a road sign is pointing the wrong way, they end up heading toward [[Bremen]] instead. Along the way they meet Gwendolyn, who is playing her lute and singing about how lonely she is. They invite her to join them on their journey, and she accepts. Lastly, the group meets Tortellini, a rooster who has just been thrown out of his home. He too is a singer, so he joins the others.\n\nThe four animals find Bremen to be a sad place; a large corporation called Mix Max, headed by the subtly-named Dr. Greed, essentially rules the city. There are NO SINGING signs posted all about, but the animals ignore them and begin singing for passersby on a street corner. A Mix Max official named Platini rides by; he overhears the singing animals and stops, intending to punish them, but when he hears how talented they are, he decides instead to put them to work for the company. He offers them a contract to sing a radio jingle for Mix Max. Tortellini announces that he is the group's leader (to the annoyance of the others), and he insists upon signing the contract immediately, without reading it. The singing animals are now known as The Fearless Four.\n\nFor a short time after this, things go well. They are shown singing the jingle in a recording studio and quickly becoming famous. Mix Max's main products are sausages, and sales skyrocket. But soon the animals grow tired of singing it over and over. They approach Platini, asking to perform their own songs, but he orders them to stick to their contract. When Gwendolyn asks how long it will be before the contract expires, Platini reveals that it is perpetual. \n\nAngered by this, the next time they sing the Mix Max song, they use their own lyrics, mocking the company. For this they are all thrown into a dungeon. Fred is taken to a separate room where he is Tickle Tortured before being thrown in with the others. A friendly mouse called Mozart helps them escape. Once free, they discover that Mix Max is bringing in all sorts of animals in order to make more sausages, including cats and dogs. Horrified, the four animals decide they must find a way to stop this. They return to the Mix Max headquarters, apologize for escaping and ask Platini if they can have their jobs back. He agrees because sausage sales have dropped while they were away. Also, Dr. Greed is now running for President, and he feels that the singing animals might help his campaign. It's arranged for The Fearless Four to perform songs favoring his campaign at a live concert. In order to prevent the animals from using that opportunity to sabotage him, Dr. Greed has his pet snake watching over them. But Mozart saves the day again, showing up with a snake-charming flute. He puts the snake to sleep, so when the concert starts, The Fearless Four are free to say whatever they like. They reveal to the audience that the Mix Max corporation has been lying about its activities, and a riot ensues. The Mix Max officials retreat to their factory, but the four animals follow them, attack them and defeat them. Lastly, they free the animals which had been destined to become sausages.\n\nThe film ends with the four animals returning to the countryside. Gwendolyn purchases her old home and turns it into a refuge for the animals freed from the sausage factory after Tortellini pressed the remote's buttons causing the factory blow up; she also finds Aunt Wanda's jewels, hidden in the woman's portrait. The animals then have a party to celebrate their freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Germany received a DVD release twice; A regular release, and one from Warner Kids (a label for Warner Bros. films that were family-friendly) using the original name, \"Die Bremer Stadtmuzikanten\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.videobuster.de/dvd-bluray-verleih/102276/die-bremer-stadtmusikanten|title=DIE BREMER STADTMUSIKANTEN|publisher=}}</ref> neither DVD has any English audio option. A much easier to find PAL VHS was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on July 19, 1999. Despite the film being pretty much unknown in the [[United States]] and in most of the world, the English dub is currently available on sources such as [[Vudu]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/The-Fearless-Four/128173|title=The Fearless Four|publisher=}}</ref>[[iTunes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-fearless-four/id1399171065 |title=The Fearless Four |publisher=}}</ref>[[Amazon Prime Video]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Four-Mario-Adorf/dp/B000SW4DZS|title=The Fearless Four|publisher=}}</ref> and the [[Microsoft Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/the-fearless-four-1997/8d6kgwzl5qnl|title=The Fearless Four|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, [[South Korea]] released the film on DVD with an English dub in it. it is unknown if Warner Archive will bring out a Region 1 DVD or Blu-Ray release in the [[United States]].\n\nVarious scenes were deleted from the original version, or shortened, when the film was distributed outside Germany, as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJBTo7pIGYY|title= The Fearless Four Deleted Scenes|publisher=Super Wario Man 100}}</ref>\n\n- In the original version there are scenes in which Dr. Greed attempts to hire an assassin to kill the owner of a rival company.  Those scenes were removed.\n\n- The scene in which Fred is tortured by the \"tickle torture\" machine was greatly shortened in some versions outside Germany, and completely removed in others.\n\n- There is a very awkward scene in the original in which Gwendolyn openly flirts with Platini while singing a song.  This was both considered inappropriate (a cat flirting with a human suggests [[bestiality]]) and out of character, since Gwendolyn doesn't flirt with anyone else during the film.  The scene was cut from international versions of the film.\n\n- A brief shot in which a bee lands on a magazine photo of a woman's breast was eliminated.\n\n- At the end of the film in the original version, the animals are shown drinking wine to celebrate their victory over Dr. Greed and his henchmen.

The film was produced by [[Munich Animation]] and released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] under the [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label. The film got [[Eberhard Junkersdorf]], the producer, a [[Bavarian Film Award]] in 1998 for \"Best Production\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Furchlosen Vier-Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119170/awards?ref_=tt_ql_op_1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe film was set in the [[Future|near future]] and based loosely on the [[folklore|folk tale]] of the \"[[Town Musicians of Bremen]]\" by the [[Brothers Grimm]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts by introducing each of the four main characters. Buster, a bloodhound, doesn't want to hunt; he wants to sing. This gets him in trouble with his master, and he ends up running away. Next we meet Fred, a donkey whose master has chosen to replace him with a robot. Fred runs away from home as well.\n\nThe third character we meet is Gwendolyn, a graceful [[Siamese cat]]. (Oddly for a Siamese, she does not have blue eyes.) Her beloved owner, Aunt Wanda, has died.  Aunt Wanda left behind two valuable jewels, but her heirs can't find them.  They decide that the cat is hiding them, and try to kill her. She escapes, taking with her a lute which she has learned to play.\n\nBuster and Fred each like to sing, and they decide to travel to a big city in order to see if they can become famous singers. They plan to go to [[Paris]], but because a road sign is pointing the wrong way, they end up heading toward [[Bremen]] instead. Along the way they meet Gwendolyn, who is playing her lute and singing about how lonely she is. They invite her to join them on their journey, and she accepts. Lastly, the group meets Tortellini, a rooster who has just been thrown out of his home. He too is a singer, so he joins the others.\n\nThe four animals find Bremen to be a sad place; a large corporation called Mix Max, headed by the subtly-named Dr. Greed, essentially rules the city. There are NO SINGING signs posted all about, but the animals ignore them and begin singing for passersby on a street corner. A Mix Max official named Platini rides by; he overhears the singing animals and stops, intending to punish them, but when he hears how talented they are, he decides instead to put them to work for the company. He offers them a contract to sing a radio jingle for Mix Max. Tortellini announces that he is the group's leader (to the annoyance of the others), and he insists upon signing the contract immediately, without reading it. The singing animals are now known as The Fearless Four.\n\nFor a short time after this, things go well. They are shown singing the jingle in a recording studio and quickly becoming famous. Mix Max's main products are sausages, and sales skyrocket. But soon the animals grow tired of singing it over and over. They approach Platini, asking to perform their own songs, but he orders them to stick to their contract. When Gwendolyn asks how long it will be before the contract expires, Platini reveals that it is perpetual. \n\nAngered by this, the next time they sing the Mix Max song, they use their own lyrics, mocking the company. For this they are all thrown into a dungeon. Fred is taken to a separate room where he is Tickle Tortured before being thrown in with the others. A friendly mouse called Mozart helps them escape. Once free, they discover that Mix Max is bringing in all sorts of animals in order to make more sausages, including cats and dogs. Horrified, the four animals decide they must find a way to stop this. They return to the Mix Max headquarters, apologize for escaping and ask Platini if they can have their jobs back. He agrees because sausage sales have dropped while they were away. Also, Dr. Greed is now running for President, and he feels that the singing animals might help his campaign. It's arranged for The Fearless Four to perform songs favoring his campaign at a live concert. In order to prevent the animals from using that opportunity to sabotage him, Dr. Greed has his pet snake watching over them. But Mozart saves the day again, showing up with a snake-charming flute. He puts the snake to sleep, so when the concert starts, The Fearless Four are free to say whatever they like. They reveal to the audience that the Mix Max corporation has been lying about its activities, and a riot ensues. The Mix Max officials retreat to their factory, but the four animals follow them, attack them and defeat them. Lastly, they free the animals which had been destined to become sausages.\n\nThe film ends with the four animals returning to the countryside. Gwendolyn purchases her old home and turns it into a refuge for the animals freed from the sausage factory after Tortellini pressed the remote's buttons causing the factory blow up; she also finds Aunt Wanda's jewels, hidden in the woman's portrait. The animals then have a party to celebrate their freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Germany received a DVD release twice; A regular release, and one from Warner Kids (a label for Warner Bros. films that were family-friendly) using the original name, \"Die Bremer Stadtmuzikanten\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.videobuster.de/dvd-bluray-verleih/102276/die-bremer-stadtmusikanten|title=DIE BREMER STADTMUSIKANTEN|publisher=}}</ref> neither DVD has any English audio option. A much easier to find PAL VHS was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on July 19, 1999. Despite the film being pretty much unknown in the [[United States]] and in most of the world, the English dub is currently available on sources such as [[Vudu]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/details/The-Fearless-Four/128173|title=The Fearless Four|publisher=}}</ref>[[iTunes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-fearless-four/id1399171065 |title=The Fearless Four |publisher=}}</ref>[[Amazon Prime Video]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Four-Mario-Adorf/dp/B000SW4DZS|title=The Fearless Four|publisher=}}</ref> and the [[Microsoft Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/the-fearless-four-1997/8d6kgwzl5qnl|title=The Fearless Four|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, [[South Korea]] released the film on DVD with an English dub in it. it is unknown if Warner Archive will bring out a Region 1 DVD or Blu-Ray release in the [[United States]].\n\nVarious scenes were deleted from the original version, or shortened, when the film was distributed outside Germany, as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJBTo7pIGYY|title= The Fearless Four Deleted Scenes|publisher=Super Wario Man 100}}</ref>\n\n- In the original version there are scenes in which Dr. Greed attempts to hire an assassin to kill the owner of a rival company.  Those scenes were removed.\n\n- The scene in which Fred is tortured by the \"tickle torture\" machine was greatly shortened in some versions outside Germany, and completely removed in others.\n\n- There is a very awkward scene in the original in which Gwendolyn openly flirts with Platini while singing a song.  This was both considered inappropriate (a cat flirting with a human suggests [[bestiality]]) and out of character, since Gwendolyn doesn't flirt with anyone else during the film.  The scene was cut from international versions of the film.\n\n- A brief shot in which a bee lands on a magazine photo of a woman's breast was eliminated.\n\n- At the end of the film in the original version, the animals are shown drinking wine to celebrate their victory over Dr. Greed and his henchmen.  The images of the animals drinking wine were removed from some international versions.\n\nThese changes reduced the run time of the film to about 81 minutes.\n\n[[Stuffed toy|Stuffed animals]],<ref>{{cite web|title=M\u00fchleck Pl\u00fcschtier - Die Furchtlosen Vier, Buster der Hund|url=https://www.amazon.de/M%C3%BChleck-Pl%C3%BCschtier-Furchtlosen-Vier-Buster/dp/B00TCUPFI6|publisher=}}</ref>a [[soundtrack]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ebay.de/itm/CD-Die-furchtlosen-Vier-Der-Soundtrack-zum-Kino-Abenteuer-OST-Ariola-RAR-/362606163157|title=CD Die furchtlosen Vier - Der Soundtrack zum Kino-Abenteuer OST - Ariola - RAR!|publisher=wobelloda}}</ref>[[Bullyland]] figures,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ebay.de/itm/Bremer-Stadtmusikanten-Die-furchtlosen-Vier-Esel-Figur-Bully-Bullyland/362645367072?hash=item546f592920:g:iuAAAOSwIhhc1T21|title=Bremer Stadtmusikanten / Die furchtlosen Vier === Esel Figur Bully Bullyland\n|publisher=monis-toyshop}}</ref>[[books]] and other items were produced for the film's release in Germany.\n\nThe film went on television in North America on [[Starz Encore|Encore]] (Encore Wam)<ref>{{cite web|title=Encore Wam-April,2009 Schedule-Starz|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/29249653|title=encore-wam-april-2009-schedule-starz|publisher=}}</ref> It went on television in France on channels such as [[AB3]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXrp4OnGEz8|title=Les Musiciens De Breme(The Fearless Four)|publisher=blackninjaTM009}}</ref> in the United Kingdom on [[Cartoon Network (UK & Ireland)|Cartoon Network]], and in [[Canada]] on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] in 2010 and [[Treehouse TV]] in 2013 and has also appeared on other channels internationally.

The British captured her in 1814 and she then served as '''HMS ''Essex''''' until sold at public auction on 6 June 1837.\n\n==Service history==\nThe frigate was built by [[Enos Briggs]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]], at a cost of $139,362 subscribed by the people of Salem and [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], to a design by William Hackett. ''Essex'' was armed with mostly short-range carronades that could not hope to match the range of 18- and 24-pounder naval guns. She was launched on 30 September 1799. On 17 December 1799 she was presented to the United States Navy and accepted by Captain [[Edward Preble]].\n\nWith the United States involved in naval action against France on 6 January 1800, ''Essex'', under the command of Captain Preble, departed [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, in company with {{USS|Congress|1799|2}} to rendezvous with a convoy of merchant ships returning from [[Jakarta|Batavia]], Dutch East Indies. Shortly after commencement of her journey, ''Essex'' became the first US Naval ship to cross the Equator.  ''Congress'' was dismasted only a few days out, and ''Essex'' was obliged to continue her voyage alone, making her mark as the first US man-of-war to double the [[Cape of Good Hope]], both in March and in August 1800 prior to successfully completing her convoy mission in November.\n\n===First Barbary War===\nCaptain [[William Bainbridge]] commanded ''Essex'' on her second cruise, whereon she sailed to the Mediterranean with the squadron of Commodore [[Richard Dale]]. Dispatched to protect American trade and seamen against depredations by the [[Barbary pirate]]s, the squadron arrived at [[Gibraltar]] on 1 July 1801 and spent the ensuing year convoying American merchantmen and blockading Tripolitan ships in their ports. Following repairs at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in 1802, ''Essex'' resumed her duties in the Mediterranean under Captain [[James Barron]] in August 1804. She participated in the [[Battle of Derne]] on 27 April 1805, and remained in those waters until the conclusion of peace terms in 1806.\n\nReturning to the Washington Navy Yard in July, she was placed [[in ordinary]] until February 1809, when she was recommissioned for sporadic use in patrolling American waters and a single cruise to Europe.\n\n===War of 1812===\nWhen war was declared against Britain on 18 June 1812, ''Essex'', commanded by Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], made a successful cruise to the southward. On 11 July near [[Bermuda]] she fell in with seven British transports (''Silverside'' being one) and by moonlight engaged and took one of them as a prize. On 13 August she encountered and captured the sloop {{HMS|Alert|1804|6}} after [[USS Essex vs HMS Alert|an engagement]]. By September, when she returned to New York, ''Essex'' had taken ten prizes. The youngest member of the ''Essex'' crew was 10-year-old midshipman [[David Glasgow Farragut]], who would become the first admiral of the US Navy. Farragut, who was Captain Porter's foster son, remained with the ship for the next two years.\n\n[[File:Uss essex.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' capturing ''Alert''.]]\n''Essex'' sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of Brazil until January 1813, decimating the [[Whaling in the United Kingdom|British whaling fleet]] in the Pacific. Although her crew suffered greatly from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile, on 14 March, having seized the whaling schooner ''Elizabeth'', and the Peruvian man-of-war ''Nereyda'' along the way. ''Nereyda'' had captured two American whalers, ''Walker'' and ''Barclay'', only to have the British whaler and privateer [[French ship \u00c9ole (1799)|''Nimrod'']] take ''Walker''. ''Nereyda'' had sent ''Barclay'' to Callao, where Porter was able to capture her before she could enter port. He sent a disarmed ''Nereyda'' back to the Peruvian authorities as a gesture of good will. He searched for ''Nimrod'' and ''Walker'', but was unable to find them.<ref>Daughan (2013), Chap. 11.</ref>{{refn|''Barclay'', Gideon Randall, master, completed her voyage, returning to New Bedford in March 1814 with 1800 barrels of whale oil. Built in 1793, she continued to hunt whales through 1857, and was finally broken up in 1859.<ref>[http://nmdl.org/aowv/whvoyage.cfm?VesselNumber=67 National Maritime Digital Library - American Offshore Whaling Voyages: A Database: ''Barclay''.]</ref>|group=Note}}\n\n{{see also|List of British whalers captured in the Pacific by the vessels of Captain David Porter, USN (1813)}}\n\nIn the next five months, ''Essex'' captured thirteen British whalers, including {{USS|Essex Junior||2}}, (ex-''Atlantic'') which cruised in company with her captor; Porter put his [[executive officer]], [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], in command of ''Essex Junior''. The two ships and nine of their prizes put in at the island of [[Nuku Hiva]] in the [[Marquesas Islands]] on 25 October 1813 for repairs. While they were there, their crews became involved in a local dispute that resulted in the [[Nuku Hiva Campaign]], which temporarily established the United States' first colony and naval base in the Pacific Ocean. ''Essex'' and ''Essex Junior'' departed Nuku Hiva in mid-December 1813.\n\nIn January 1814, ''Essex'' sailed into neutral waters at Valpara\u00edso, only to be trapped there for six weeks by the British frigate, {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|6}} (36 guns), under Captain [[James Hillyar]], and the sloop-of-war {{HMS|Cherub|1806|6}} (18 guns). On 28 March 1814, Porter determined to gain the open sea, fearing the arrival of British reinforcements. Upon rounding the point, ''Essex'' lost her main top-mast to foul weather and was brought to action just north of Valpara\u00edso.<ref name=\"navy.mil\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display_word.asp?story_id=37263 |title=Title unknown |format=msdoc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522135545/http://www.navy.mil/search/display_word.asp?story_id=37263 |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Vidette Times|The Vidette-Messenger]] |location=Valparaiso, Porter County, Indiana |date=18 August 1936 |volume=10 |page=4 |title=Diagram of Commodore David Porter's Exploits Against British in 1812\u20131814 |url=http://inportercounty.org/Data/PorterCountyCentennial/Sec1-4_PorterCoCenn-DavidPorterDiagram.html}}</ref> [[File:NavalMonument10 byAbelBowen 1838.png|thumb|280px|Engraving by [[Abel Bowen]]]]\n\n{{main|Battle of Valparaiso}}\n\nDespite Porter's complaints to the US Navy on several occasions, ''Essex'' was armed almost entirely with powerful but short-range 32-pounder carronades that gave ''Phoebe'', armed with long 18-pounders, a decisive advantage at long range.

The British captured her in 1814 and she then served as '''HMS ''Essex''''' until sold at public auction on 6 June 1837.\n\n==Service history==\nThe frigate was built by [[Enos Briggs]], [[Salem, Massachusetts]], at a cost of $139,362 subscribed by the people of Salem and [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], to a design by William Hackett. ''Essex'' was armed with mostly short-range carronades that could not hope to match the range of 18- and 24-pounder naval guns. She was launched on 30 September 1799. On 17 December 1799 she was presented to the United States Navy and accepted by Captain [[Edward Preble]].\n\nWith the United States involved in naval action against France on 6 January 1800, ''Essex'', under the command of Captain Preble, departed [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, in company with {{USS|Congress|1799|2}} to rendezvous with a convoy of merchant ships returning from [[Jakarta|Batavia]], Dutch East Indies. Shortly after commencement of her journey, ''Essex'' became the first US Naval ship to cross the Equator.  ''Congress'' was dismasted only a few days out, and ''Essex'' was obliged to continue her voyage alone, making her mark as the first US man-of-war to double the [[Cape of Good Hope]], both in March and in August 1800 prior to successfully completing her convoy mission in November.\n\n===First Barbary War===\nCaptain [[William Bainbridge]] commanded ''Essex'' on her second cruise, whereon she sailed to the Mediterranean with the squadron of Commodore [[Richard Dale]]. Dispatched to protect American trade and seamen against depredations by the [[Barbary pirate]]s, the squadron arrived at [[Gibraltar]] on 1 July 1801 and spent the ensuing year convoying American merchantmen and blockading Tripolitan ships in their ports. Following repairs at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in 1802, ''Essex'' resumed her duties in the Mediterranean under Captain [[James Barron]] in August 1804. She participated in the [[Battle of Derne]] on 27 April 1805, and remained in those waters until the conclusion of peace terms in 1806.\n\nReturning to the Washington Navy Yard in July, she was placed [[in ordinary]] until February 1809, when she was recommissioned for sporadic use in patrolling American waters and a single cruise to Europe.\n\n===War of 1812===\nWhen war was declared against Britain on 18 June 1812, ''Essex'', commanded by Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], made a successful cruise to the southward. On 11 July near [[Bermuda]] she fell in with seven British transports (''Silverside'' being one) and by moonlight engaged and took one of them as a prize. On 13 August she encountered and captured the sloop {{HMS|Alert|1804|6}} after [[USS Essex vs HMS Alert|an engagement]]. By September, when she returned to New York, ''Essex'' had taken ten prizes. The youngest member of the ''Essex'' crew was 10-year-old midshipman [[David Glasgow Farragut]], who would become the first admiral of the US Navy. Farragut, who was Captain Porter's foster son, remained with the ship for the next two years.\n\n[[File:Uss essex.jpg|thumb|''Essex'' capturing ''Alert''.]]\n''Essex'' sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of Brazil until January 1813, decimating the [[Whaling in the United Kingdom|British whaling fleet]] in the Pacific. Although her crew suffered greatly from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile, on 14 March, having seized the whaling schooner ''Elizabeth'', and the Peruvian man-of-war ''Nereyda'' along the way. ''Nereyda'' had captured two American whalers, ''Walker'' and ''Barclay'', only to have the British whaler and privateer [[French ship \u00c9ole (1799)|''Nimrod'']] take ''Walker''. ''Nereyda'' had sent ''Barclay'' to Callao, where Porter was able to capture her before she could enter port. He sent a disarmed ''Nereyda'' back to the Peruvian authorities as a gesture of good will. He searched for ''Nimrod'' and ''Walker'', but was unable to find them.<ref>Daughan (2013), Chap. 11.</ref>{{refn|''Barclay'', Gideon Randall, master, completed her voyage, returning to New Bedford in March 1814 with 1800 barrels of whale oil. Built in 1793, she continued to hunt whales through 1857, and was finally broken up in 1859.<ref>[http://nmdl.org/aowv/whvoyage.cfm?VesselNumber=67 National Maritime Digital Library - American Offshore Whaling Voyages: A Database: ''Barclay''.]</ref>|group=Note}}\n\n{{see also|List of British whalers captured in the Pacific by the vessels of Captain David Porter, USN (1813)}}\n\nIn the next five months, ''Essex'' captured thirteen British whalers, including {{USS|Essex Junior||2}}, (ex-''Atlantic'') which cruised in company with her captor; Porter put his [[executive officer]], [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], in command of ''Essex Junior''. The two ships and nine of their prizes put in at the island of [[Nuku Hiva]] in the [[Marquesas Islands]] on 25 October 1813 for repairs. While they were there, their crews became involved in a local dispute that resulted in the [[Nuku Hiva Campaign]], which temporarily established the United States' first colony and naval base in the Pacific Ocean. ''Essex'' and ''Essex Junior'' departed Nuku Hiva in mid-December 1813.\n\nIn January 1814, ''Essex'' sailed into neutral waters at Valpara\u00edso, only to be trapped there for six weeks by the British frigate, {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|6}} (36 guns), under Captain [[James Hillyar]], and the sloop-of-war {{HMS|Cherub|1806|6}} (18 guns). On 28 March 1814, Porter determined to gain the open sea, fearing the arrival of British reinforcements. Upon rounding the point, ''Essex'' lost her main top-mast to foul weather and was brought to action just north of Valpara\u00edso.<ref name=\"navy.mil\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display_word.asp?story_id=37263 |title=Title unknown |format=msdoc |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522135545/http://www.navy.mil/search/display_word.asp?story_id=37263 |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Vidette Times|The Vidette-Messenger]] |location=Valparaiso, Porter County, Indiana |date=18 August 1936 |volume=10 |page=4 |title=Diagram of Commodore David Porter's Exploits Against British in 1812\u20131814 |url=http://inportercounty.org/Data/PorterCountyCentennial/Sec1-4_PorterCoCenn-DavidPorterDiagram.html}}</ref> [[File:NavalMonument10 byAbelBowen 1838.png|thumb|280px|Engraving by [[Abel Bowen]]]]\n\n{{main|Battle of Valparaiso}}\n\nDespite Porter's complaints to the US Navy on several occasions, ''Essex'' was armed almost entirely with powerful but short-range 32-pounder carronades that gave ''Phoebe'', armed with long 18-pounders, a decisive advantage at long range.
