This allows more room for the physical page address, or \"page frame number\" field, in the page table entry. In the initial implementations of PAE the page frame number field was expanded from 20 to 24 bits. The size of the \"byte offset\" from the address being translated is still 12 bits, so total physical address size increases from 32&nbsp;bits to 36&nbsp;bits (i.e. from 20+12 to 24+12). This increased the physical memory that is theoretically addressable by the CPU from 4&nbsp;GB to 64&nbsp;GB.\n\nIn the first processors that supported PAE, support for larger physical addresses is evident in their package pinout, with address pin designations going up to A35 instead of stopping at A31.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pentium\u00ae III Xeon\u2122 Processor at 500 and 550 MHz Datasheet | publisher=Intel Corporation |publication-date=February 2000 |id=245094-002 |quote=A[35:03]# (I/O): The A[35:3]# (Address) signals define a 2-to-the-36-byte physical memory address space.  |page=86 }}</ref> Later processor families use interconnects such as [[Hypertransport]] or [[QuickPath Interconnect]], which lack dedicated memory address signals, so this relationship is less apparent. \n\nThe 32-bit size of the virtual address is not changed, so regular application software continues to use instructions with 32-bit addresses and (in a [[flat memory model]]) is limited to 4&nbsp;gigabytes of virtual address space. Operating systems supporting this mode use [[page table]]s to map the regular 4&nbsp;GB virtual address space into the physical memory, which, depending on the operating system and the rest of the hardware platform, may be as big as 64&nbsp;GB. The mapping is typically applied separately for each [[Process (computing)|process]], so that the additional RAM is useful even though no single process can access it all simultaneously.\n\nLater work associated with AMD's development of [[x86-64]] architecture expanded the theoretical possible size of physical addresses to 52 bits.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Page table structures ==\n\nIn [[protected mode]] with paging enabled (bit&nbsp;31, <code>PG</code>, of control register <code>CR0</code> is set), but without PAE, [[x86]] processors use a two-level page translation scheme. [[Control register]] <code>CR3</code> holds the page-aligned physical address of a single 4&nbsp;KB long ''page directory''. This is divided into 1024 four-byte page directory entries that in turn, if valid, hold the page-aligned physical addresses of [[page table]]s, each 4&nbsp;KB in size. These similarly consist of 1024 four-byte page table entries which, if valid, hold the page-aligned physical addresses of 4&nbsp;KB long [[page (computing)|pages]] of physical memory (RAM). \n\nEnabling PAE (by setting bit&nbsp;5, <code>PAE</code>, of the system register <code>CR4</code>) causes major changes to this scheme. By default, the size of each page remains as 4&nbsp;KB. Each entry in the page table and page directory becomes 64&nbsp;bits long (8&nbsp;bytes), instead of 32&nbsp;bits, to allow for additional address bits. However, the size of each table ''does not'' change, so both table and directory now have only 512 entries. Because this allows only one half of the entries of the original scheme, an extra level of hierarchy has been added, so CR3 now points physically to a ''Page Directory Pointer Table'', a short table containing four pointers to page directories.\n\nThe entries in the page directory have an additional flag in bit&nbsp;7, named <code>PS</code> (for ''page size''). If the system has set this bit to <code>1</code>, the page directory entry does not point to a page table but to a single, large 2&nbsp;MB page ([[Page Size Extension]]).\n\nIn all page table formats supported by [[x86]] and [[x86-64]], the 12 least significant bits of the page table entry are either interpreted by the memory management unit or are reserved for operating system use. In processors that implement the \"no-execute\" or \"execution disable\" feature, the most significant bit (bit&nbsp;63) is the [[NX bit]]. The next eleven most significant bits (bits 52 through 62) are reserved for operating system use by both Intel and AMD's architecture specifications. Thus, from 64 bits in the page table entry, 12 low-order and 12 high-order bits have other uses, leaving 40 bits (bits 12 though 51) for the physical page number. Combined with 12 bits of \"offset within page\" from the linear address, a maximum of 52&nbsp;bits are available to address physical memory. This allows a maximum RAM configuration of 2<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;bytes, or 4&nbsp;petabytes (about 4.5\u00d710<sup>15</sup> bytes).\n\nOn [[x86-64]] processors in native [[long mode]], the address translation scheme uses PAE but adds a fourth table, the 512-entry ''page-map level&nbsp;4'' table, and extends the page directory pointer table to 512&nbsp;entries instead of the original 4&nbsp;entries it has in protected mode. Currently 48&nbsp;bits of virtual page number are translated, giving a virtual address space of up to 256&nbsp;TB.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=148}}\nIn the page table entries, in the original specification, 40&nbsp;bits of physical page number are implemented.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Page table structures\" widths=\"400px\" heights=\"300px\" perrow=\"2\">\nImage:X86 Paging 4K.svg|No PAE, 4&nbsp;KB pages\nImage:X86 Paging 4M.svg|No PAE, 4&nbsp;MB pages\nImage:X86 Paging PAE 4K.svg|With PAE; 4&nbsp;KB pages\nImage:X86 Paging PAE 2M.svg|With PAE; 2&nbsp;MB pages\n</gallery>\n\n== Hardware support ==\n{{see also|CPUID}}\n\nSoftware can identify via the <code>[[CPUID]]</code> flag <code>PAE</code> whether a CPU supports PAE mode or not.

To use PAE to access more than 4 GB of RAM, further support is required in the operating system, in the chipset, and on the motherboard. Some chipsets do not support physical memory addresses above 4 GB (FFFFFFFF in hexadecimal), and some motherboards simply do not have enough RAM sockets to allow the installation of more than 4 GB of RAM.

This allows more room for the physical page address, or \"page frame number\" field, in the page table entry. In the initial implementations of PAE the page frame number field was expanded from 20 to 24 bits. The size of the \"byte offset\" from the address being translated is still 12 bits, so total physical address size increases from 32&nbsp;bits to 36&nbsp;bits (i.e. from 20+12 to 24+12). This increased the physical memory that is theoretically addressable by the CPU from 4&nbsp;GB to 64&nbsp;GB.\n\nIn the first processors that supported PAE, support for larger physical addresses is evident in their package pinout, with address pin designations going up to A35 instead of stopping at A31.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pentium\u00ae III Xeon\u2122 Processor at 500 and 550 MHz Datasheet | publisher=Intel Corporation |publication-date=February 2000 |id=245094-002 |quote=A[35:03]# (I/O): The A[35:3]# (Address) signals define a 2-to-the-36-byte physical memory address space.  |page=86 }}</ref> Later processor families use interconnects such as [[Hypertransport]] or [[QuickPath Interconnect]], which lack dedicated memory address signals, so this relationship is less apparent. \n\nThe 32-bit size of the virtual address is not changed, so regular application software continues to use instructions with 32-bit addresses and (in a [[flat memory model]]) is limited to 4&nbsp;gigabytes of virtual address space. Operating systems supporting this mode use [[page table]]s to map the regular 4&nbsp;GB virtual address space into the physical memory, which, depending on the operating system and the rest of the hardware platform, may be as big as 64&nbsp;GB. The mapping is typically applied separately for each [[Process (computing)|process]], so that the additional RAM is useful even though no single process can access it all simultaneously.\n\nLater work associated with AMD's development of [[x86-64]] architecture expanded the theoretical possible size of physical addresses to 52 bits.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Page table structures ==\n\nIn [[protected mode]] with paging enabled (bit&nbsp;31, <code>PG</code>, of control register <code>CR0</code> is set), but without PAE, [[x86]] processors use a two-level page translation scheme. [[Control register]] <code>CR3</code> holds the page-aligned physical address of a single 4&nbsp;KB long ''page directory''. This is divided into 1024 four-byte page directory entries that in turn, if valid, hold the page-aligned physical addresses of [[page table]]s, each 4&nbsp;KB in size. These similarly consist of 1024 four-byte page table entries which, if valid, hold the page-aligned physical addresses of 4&nbsp;KB long [[page (computing)|pages]] of physical memory (RAM). \n\nEnabling PAE (by setting bit&nbsp;5, <code>PAE</code>, of the system register <code>CR4</code>) causes major changes to this scheme. By default, the size of each page remains as 4&nbsp;KB. Each entry in the page table and page directory becomes 64&nbsp;bits long (8&nbsp;bytes), instead of 32&nbsp;bits, to allow for additional address bits. However, the size of each table ''does not'' change, so both table and directory now have only 512 entries. Because this allows only one half of the entries of the original scheme, an extra level of hierarchy has been added, so CR3 now points physically to a ''Page Directory Pointer Table'', a short table containing four pointers to page directories.\n\nThe entries in the page directory have an additional flag in bit&nbsp;7, named <code>PS</code> (for ''page size''). If the system has set this bit to <code>1</code>, the page directory entry does not point to a page table but to a single, large 2&nbsp;MB page ([[Page Size Extension]]).\n\nIn all page table formats supported by [[x86]] and [[x86-64]], the 12 least significant bits of the page table entry are either interpreted by the memory management unit or are reserved for operating system use. In processors that implement the \"no-execute\" or \"execution disable\" feature, the most significant bit (bit&nbsp;63) is the [[NX bit]]. The next eleven most significant bits (bits 52 through 62) are reserved for operating system use by both Intel and AMD's architecture specifications. Thus, from 64 bits in the page table entry, 12 low-order and 12 high-order bits have other uses, leaving 40 bits (bits 12 though 51) for the physical page number. Combined with 12 bits of \"offset within page\" from the linear address, a maximum of 52&nbsp;bits are available to address physical memory. This allows a maximum RAM configuration of 2<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;bytes, or 4&nbsp;petabytes (about 4.5\u00d710<sup>15</sup> bytes).\n\nOn [[x86-64]] processors in native [[long mode]], the address translation scheme uses PAE but adds a fourth table, the 512-entry ''page-map level&nbsp;4'' table, and extends the page directory pointer table to 512&nbsp;entries instead of the original 4&nbsp;entries it has in protected mode. Currently 48&nbsp;bits of virtual page number are translated, giving a virtual address space of up to 256&nbsp;TB.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=148}}\nIn the page table entries, in the original specification, 40&nbsp;bits of physical page number are implemented.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Page table structures\" widths=\"400px\" heights=\"300px\" perrow=\"2\">\nImage:X86 Paging 4K.svg|No PAE, 4&nbsp;KB pages\nImage:X86 Paging 4M.svg|No PAE, 4&nbsp;MB pages\nImage:X86 Paging PAE 4K.svg|With PAE; 4&nbsp;KB pages\nImage:X86 Paging PAE 2M.svg|With PAE; 2&nbsp;MB pages\n</gallery>\n\n== Hardware support ==\n{{see also|CPUID}}\n\nSoftware can identify via the <code>[[CPUID]]</code> flag <code>PAE</code> whether a CPU supports PAE mode or not.

To use PAE to access more than 4 GB of RAM, further support is required in the operating system, in the chipset, and on the motherboard. Some chipsets do not support physical memory addresses above 4 GB (FFFFFFFF in hexadecimal), and some motherboards simply do not have enough RAM sockets to allow the installation of more than 4 GB of RAM.

As a [[comics anthology]] it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\")<ref group=note>Prog: short for \"programme\" as issues are supposedly beamed directly to the printed page.</ref> and was first published by [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]] in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its [[Fleetway]] comics subsidiary, which was sold to [[Robert Maxwell]] in 1987 and then to [[Egmont UK]] in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\n''2000 AD'' is most noted for its ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. Other characters in ''2000 AD'' include ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and the ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====Pre-publication====\nIn December 1975, [[Kelvin Gosnell]], a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]], read an article in the [[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]] about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC asked [[Pat Mills]], a [[freelance]] writer and [[editing|editor]] who had created ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]'' and ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer [[John Wagner]] on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name ''2000 AD'' was chosen by the publisher, John Sanders,<ref name=\":0\">Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books).</ref>{{Rp|pp.25\u201326}} as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|p.37}}\n\nMills' experiences with ''Battle'' and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his [[anti-authoritarian]] attitudes. Wagner, who had written a [[Dirty Harry]]-inspired tough cop called ''[[One-Eyed Jack (comics)|One-Eyed Jack]]'' for ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'', saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future [[New York City|New York]] with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. Meanwhile, Mills had developed a [[horror fiction|horror]] strip, inspired by the novels of [[Dennis Wheatley]], about a [[hanging judge]], called ''Judge Dread'' (after the [[reggae]] and [[ska]] artist of the [[Judge Dread|same name]]). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\n\nThe task of visualising the newly named ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' was given to [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on ''Battle'', on a strip called ''Major Eazy''. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\n\nMills was reluctant to lose ''Judge Dredd'', and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that ''Dredd'' would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris, extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell,<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|pp.70\u201372}}<ref group=note>Harris also wrote two ''Future Shocks'' and one episode of ''M.A.C.H. One''. [http://2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=thrills&Comic=2000AD&Field=Writer&choice=peterha]</ref> and drawn by newcomer [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. The strip debuted in prog 2.\n\nIPC owned the rights to ''[[Dan Dare]]'', and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned ''Dare'''s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\n\n====The opening line-up====\n\n''[[Dan Dare]]'' was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist [[Massimo Belardinelli]], whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few ''Dan Dare'' fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing ''Dan Dare'' and Belardinelli drawing the ''Harlem Heroes'' sequel ''Inferno''. When Gibbons took over ''Dan Dare'' in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"''Star Trek''\" style space opera.\n\nMills had also created ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', and the similarly-themed film [[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]] had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on ''Harlem Heroes'' by [[Trigo (comics)|Trigo]] was disappointing. Veteran British artists [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] and [[Barrie Mitchell]] were tried out, but the newcomer [[Dave Gibbons]] won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' writer [[Tom Tully (comic writer)|Tom Tully]].\n\nThe other opening strips were ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', a super-powered secret agent inspired by ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''; ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter Bill Savage; and ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]'', a strip about [[Time travel|time-travelling]] cowboys farming [[dinosaur]]s for their meat.\n\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to [[Kelvin Gosnell]], whose idea the comic had been in the first place. Gosnell appeared as the fall guy in the ''[[Tharg the Mighty]]'' comedy [[Fumetti|photostrips]] that were a feature of the comic in its early years.\n\n====Early years====\nWagner returned to write ''Judge Dredd'', starting in prog 9. His \"[[The Robot Wars|Robot Wars]]\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]], and marked the point where ''Dredd'' became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.<ref>Jarman, Colin M. and Peter Acton (1995) ''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'', Lennard Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}, p. 58</ref> Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as [[Mega-City One]]. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a 'censored' banner slapped on it. After this Dredd's face was never attempted to be shown again.\n\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 ''[[Future Shocks|Tharg's Future Shocks]]'', one-off twist-in-the-tail stories devised by writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. ''2000 AD'' still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\n\nWagner introduced a new character, ''[[Robo-Hunter]]'', in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a [[private detective]]-type character specialising in [[robot]]-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a [[Cuba]]n robot [[cigar]], Stogie, designed to help him cut down on [[nicotine]].\n\nOther ongoing strips included ''The Visible Man'', detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and ''Shako'', (which followed the same formula as ''Hook Jaw'' from ''Action'' but with less success) the story of a [[polar bear]] pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\n''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'' was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, ''M.A.C.H. Zero'', continued into the 1980s. ''Flesh'' had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, ''Disaster 1990'', in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\n\nIn 1977 ''2000 AD'' launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full length ''M.A.C.H. Zero'' story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 and would continue till 1991.\n\nPat Mills took over writing ''Dredd'' for a six-month \"epic\" called \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\", inspired by [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Damnation Alley]]'', which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while ''Dan Dare'' was given the front page.\n\nIPC had launched a second science fiction comic, ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into ''2000 AD'' from prog 86.<ref>[https://michaelowencarroll.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/eaglution-of-british-comics-part-1/ ''The Eaglution of British Comics''] by Michael Carroll, 26 May 2018. (Retrieved 27 May 2018.)</ref> As Gosnell was editor of ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' at the same time, ''2000 AD'' sub-editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the latter comic himself during this time.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">\"A brief history of Starlord\" from \"Watch the stars!\" website {{cite web|url=http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Starlord |accessdate=10 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128232417/http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}</ref> Two ''Starlord'' strips strengthened ''2000 AD'''s line-up: ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a robot disaster squad created by Mills. ''Ro-Busters'' gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. ''Strontium Dog'' and ''ABC Warriors'' continued to feature in ''2000 AD'' for the next 40 years. (A third ''Starlord'' series, ''Timequake'', only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) ''Dan Dare'' was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to ''Dredd'' following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane [[Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], based on the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]]. Another cancelled title, ''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'', was merged with ''2000 AD'' a few months later from prog 127, contributing three stories to ''2000 AD'': ''[[Blackhawk (Tornado)|Blackhawk]]'', an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman empire which took a science-fictional turn in ''2000 AD'' with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; ''[[The Mind of Wolfie Smith]]'', a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and ''Captain Klep'', a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike ''Starlord's'', did not continue for very long.\n\n''2000 AD'' featured an adaptation of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s novel ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat]]'', written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', would follow later.   The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on [[James Coburn]], evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for ''[[Major Eazy]]'', which Ezquerra drew in ''Battle,'' as well as ''Judge Koburn'', a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003.  [[Gerry Finley-Day]] contributed ''[[The V.C.s]]'', a future war story inspired by the [[Vietnam War]], drawn by McMahon, [[Cam Kennedy]], [[Garry Leach]] and [[John Richardson (comics)|John Richardson]].\n\nA feature of the early years of ''2000 AD'' was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n\n[[Steve MacManus]] took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980 ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' gained a new enemy. Writer [[John Wagner]] realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was [[Judge Death]], an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by [[Brian Bolland]] which also introduced [[Judge Anderson]] and [[Psi Division]], a squad of judges with psychic powers.\n\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"[[Judge Child|The Judge Child]]\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to [[Texas City]], and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the [[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]], was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]. The pair would go on to write ''Strontium Dog'', ''Robo-Hunter'' and many other stories for ''2000 AD'', as well as for ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' and the relaunched ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\n\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of Judge Dredd, were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of [[Mean Arena]], set around a violent high-tech street football game, [[Meltdown Man]], whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of [[Strontium Dog]], featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short-lived ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' title, and [[Dash Decent]], a  [[Flash Gordon]] [[parody]].\n\n[[Pat Mills]] introduced ''Comic Rock'', which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by [[The Jam]]'s ''Going Underground'', was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called [[Nemesis the Warlock|Nemesis]] battles the despotic [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in ''Ro-Busters'', which management objected to.\n\nThe only other ''Comic Rock'' story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a [[Teleportation|teleport]] system. This led to a series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future, Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on ''2000 AD'' pay. He left to work for [[DC Comics]] in America, and was replaced on ''Nemesis'' by first [[Jesus Redondo]] and then [[Bryan Talbot]].\n\n''2000 AD'' would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' was a World War II [[vampire]] story by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] which was probably originally intended for ''Battle''. Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his [[Romania]]n allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\n\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor [[Steve MacManus]] and artists Dave Gibbons devised ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', a \"[[G.I. (comics)|Genetic Infantryman]]\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]], [[Brett Ewins]] and  [[Cam Kennedy]]. Rogue Trooper replaced [[Meltdown Man]], which had recently ended its run.\n\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] craze, was ''[[Ace Trucking Co.]]'', a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\n\nIn the ''Judge Dredd'' series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size.  \"[[Block Mania]]\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of [[Mutually assured destruction]]. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\n\nA new writer, [[Alan Moore]], had started contributing ''[[Future Shocks]]'' in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various [[Marvel UK]] titles and the independent magazine ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. In 1982 he gained his first series, ''[[Skizz]]'', a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', set in [[Birmingham]] and influenced by [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. The series was drawn by [[Jim Baikie]].\n\nMoore wrote another series, ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', spun off from a one-off ''Time Twister''. Drawn by [[Alan Davis]], the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' with artist [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\n\nA new character, ''[[Sl\u00e1ine (comics)|Sl\u00e1ine]]'', debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by [[Pat Mills]] and his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]], ''Sl\u00e1ine'' was a barbarian [[fantasy]] strip based on [[Celtic mythology]]. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\n\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in ''Judge Dredd'', ''[[Judge Anderson]]'' finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist [[Glenn Fabry]] debuted on ''Sl\u00e1ine'', but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]]. In the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#\"Letter From a Democrat\": The martyrdom of Hester Hyman|Letter from a Democrat]]\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a [[police state]]. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\n\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, ''Sl\u00e1ine the King'', began, entirely drawn by Fabry. [[Peter Milligan]], a writer who had been contributing ''Future Shocks'', began two series, the bleak future war story ''[[Bad Company (comics)|Bad Company]]'' and a strange, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] series called ''The Dead''. In 1986, ''2000 AD'' was selling  150,000 copies a week.\n\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] as Fleetway. ''2000 AD'' was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. [[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]] became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short ''Nemesis'' series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'', ''2000 AD'''s first serious superhero strip, by new writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Steve Yeowell]]. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elder gods.\n\nWagner and Grant began a new ''Dredd'' Epic, \"[[Oz (Judge Dredd story)|Oz]]\", featuring [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the [[Judda]], a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was ''[[The Last American]]'', a mini series for [[Epic Comics]] which would mark the end)  in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept ''Dredd'', while Grant continued ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Anderson''. However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\n\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by [[Colin MacNeil]].\n\nThe ''ABC Warriors'' finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from ''Nemesis''. This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer [[Simon Bisley]] and science fiction artist [[SMS (comics)|S.M.S.]].\n\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new ''Strontium Dog'' story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\n\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for ''Judge Dredd'', but were later given over to a new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by [[Simon Bisley]]. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\n\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was ''Rogue Trooper: the War Machine'', written by Dave Gibbons and painted by [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]. The original ''Rogue Trooper'' series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the 'Hit' series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, [[Friday (2000 AD)|Friday]], in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\n\nOne of the black and white stories, \"[[The Dead Man]]\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n\n===1990s===\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new ''Judge Dredd'' story, \"[[The Dead Man#Tale of the Dead Man|Tale of the Dead Man]]\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the '[[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\n\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\n''2000 AD'' gained an influx of talent from other comics. [[Garth Ennis]] and [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] had come to prominence writing for ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a ''2000 AD'' spin-off for older readers, while artists [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Philip Bond]] were the stars of ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]'', an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Brett Ewins]]. Smith created ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a [[time travel]] story featuring [[Jack the Ripper]]. [[Garth Ennis]] and Philip Bond contributed ''Time Flies'', a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer [[Peter Milligan]] for the surreal ''[[Hewligan's Haircut]]''. Writer [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] and artist [[Simon Jacob]] created ''[[Armoured Gideon]]'', an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\n\nThe ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\n\nAmerican writer [[Michael Fleisher]], who had written ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' and ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new ''Rogue Trooper'', along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set ''2000 AD'' on fire was [[Mark Millar]], whose revival of ''Robo-Hunter'' was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''.\n\n''2000 AD'' went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, ''[[Toxic!]]'', launched by Pat Mills and many of the core ''2000 AD'' team of creators. ''Toxic!'' only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for ''2000 AD''. ''[[Button Man]]'', a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and [[Arthur Ranson]], was originally intended for ''Toxic!'' but ended up in ''2000 AD''.\n\nA new ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by [[Kev Walker]], began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\n\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company which owned rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\n\nIn 1992, ''2000 AD'' and the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' ran their first crossover story, \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", in which [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]s overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, [[Peter Doherty (comics)|Peter Doherty]], [[Dean Ormston]] and [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]], the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist [[Paul Marshall (comics)|Paul Marshall]] created ''[[Firekind]]'', a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\n\nThe ''Strontium Dog'' world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name ''Strontium Dogs'' \u2013 characters such as female vampire [[Durham Red]], the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak 'heartses', became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter ''The Darkest Star'', it transpires that the one to ''actually'' kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\n\n{{anchor|Summer Offensive}}<!-- [[Summer Offensive (comics)]] links here -->\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor [[Alan McKenzie]] gave free rein to writers [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, ''[[Really & Truly]]''. Smith contributed ''[[Slaughterbowl]]'', in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote ''[[Maniac 5]]'', an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] attitudes titled ''[[Big Dave (comics)|Big Dave]]'', written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].\n\n[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine'', \"[[Mechanismo|Wilderlands]]\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, [[Mick Austin]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]], it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the ''Megazine'' in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, ''Judge Dredd'' was again the flagship strip.\n\nFormer ''Megazine'' editor [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] introduced ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]], who had worked with Bishop on the ''Megazine'', created ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'', a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, ''[[The Spacegirls]]'', a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the [[Spice Girls]], ''[[M.A.C.H. 1|B.L.A.I.R. 1]]'', a parody of [[Tony Blair]] based on ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', and an adaptation of the [[Danny Boyle]] film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]''.\n\nA new ''Dredd'' epic, \"[[The Doomsday Scenario|Doomsday]]\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine''. Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like [[Judge Edgar]] of the Public Surveillance Unit, and [[Galen DeMarco]], a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n\n1999 also saw the return of another character, ''Nemesis the Warlock''. After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by [[Henry Flint]] in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's ''ABC Warriors'' work.\n\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, ''Nemesis'' wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in ''Nikolai Dante'', and writer [[Gordon Rennie]] and artist [[Mark Harrison (artist)|Mark Harrison]] introduced future war story ''Glimmer Rats''. Another old favourite, ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n\n===2000s===\nThe publisher has been owned by [[Rebellion Developments]] since 2000, with editors [[Andy Diggle]] and [[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]] at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', and has also introduced a roster of new series including ''[[Shakara]]'', ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. It has also published a tie-in to the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' in a story written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including [[Boo Cook]], [[Dom Reardon]] and [[Al Ewing]]. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound [[exchange rate]] that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\n\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including ''[[London Falling]]'', ''[[Stone Island (2000AD)|Stone Island]]'' and ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]''. Other developments include a revamping of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' which has included a section acting as a showcase for [[British small press comics]]. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a 'prelude' to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\n\nIn prog 1526,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=prog&page=profiles&choice=1526 |title=Prog 1526 |publisher=2000ad.org |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> dated 28 February 2007, ''2000 AD'' celebrated their 30th anniversary.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6390731.stm 30 years of the future], [[BBC]], 26 February 2007</ref> The issue saw the start of two new storylines: ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'' (by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]) and ''[[Invasion!

Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History''. Later in that year, [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Partworks]] began publishing ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'', an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. This followed the success of ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\n\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the ''2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018'', which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/the-futures-female-2000ads-all-women-special \"The future's female? 2000AD's all-women special\"], by David Barnett, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 June 2018.</ref>\n\n==Lists of stories==\n{{Main|List of 2000 AD stories}}\n*A complete index of stories published in ''2000 AD'' from February 1977 to December 2019 (#1 to #2162) is [[Media:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]] (WikiCommons).<ref>[[commons:File:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n*A more detailed list of all the ''Judge Dredd'' stories to appear in ''2000 AD'' (including specials and annuals) from March 1977 to December 2019 can be found [[Media:Dredd2AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]].<ref>[[commons:File:Dredd2AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n\n==Crossovers==\n{{main|2000 AD crossovers}}\nAlthough there is no overall [[shared universe]] containing all ''2000 AD'' stories, some stories [[2000 AD crossovers|spin-off or crossover]] into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the [[Judge Dredd|Judge Dredd universe]]. Many stories by [[Pat Mills]], which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by the writer. Many stories written by [[Ian Edginton]] feature shared themes and references.\n\n==Editors==\n{{Main|Tharg the Mighty}}\nA long-running theme is that the [[editing|editor]] of ''2000 AD'' is [[Tharg the Mighty]], a green [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from [[Betelgeuse]] who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229.  In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre.  In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Eathlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender.  From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.<ref>Prog 531, 18 July 1987 \u2013 \"Earthlette H Maton\"</ref>\n\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of [[robot]]s to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life [[industrial action]] that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s).

to ''2000 AD'' is the monthly  ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd, but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well.\n* The bimonthly ''2000 AD Extreme Edition'' presented reprints of classic and hard-to-find 2000AD stories, but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid-2008. Since the cancellation, a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' instead.\n*''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' was a weekly title (originally intended to be monthly) launched in 1978 following much the same format as ''2000 AD'' and included ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' which introduced characters that would later reappear in ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. The two titles were merged later the same year and published as ''2000AD and Starlord''. A third ''Starlord'' series, ''TimeQuake'', also had a 4-week run in ''2000AD'' over a year later.\n*''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'' was a weekly title launched in 1979. There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series. It was merged with ''2000 AD'' after 22 issues, transferring the strips ''[[Blackhawk (UK comic)|Blackhawk]]'', ''The Mind of Wolfie Smith'' and ''Captain Klep''. For a while the publication was titled ''2000 AD and Tornado''.\n*''[[Diceman (comics)|Diceman]]'' was an early attempt at creating a [[role-playing]] comic featuring regular ''2000 AD'' characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine, as well as original characters, like Diceman. The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues.\n*''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' (1988\u20131991) was a sister publication that did not follow the format of ''2000 AD'', but did share many editorial staff and creative teams. Early issues featured two SF-themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than ''2000 AD'' with strong political themes. It became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market. The ''2000 AD'' series ''Finn'', begun the year after ''Crisis'' was cancelled, continued the adventures of the character from ''Third World War'', though with more of a fantasy emphasis.\n*''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' (1990\u20131991) joined ''Crisis'' though it only lasted for seven issues. Dan Dare was in the original line-up, and this transferred to ''Crisis'' when ''Revolver'' finished.\n*''[[Toxic!]]'' was a short-lived rival publication, established by ''2000 AD'' talent, that was published during 1991.\n*A ''Best of 2000 AD'' title was published in the mid-1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of ''2000 AD''. In the early 1990s, ''The Complete Judge Dredd'' began publication in a similar format. Both titles were relaunched as ''Classic 2000AD'' and ''Classic Judge Dredd'' in the mid-1990s but were cancelled soon after.\n*A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990 (though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year). From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover ''2000AD Yearbook''; the last of these was published in 1994. There were also annuals/yearbooks dedicated to ''2000 AD'' characters such as ''Dan Dare'' (1978\u20131979, cover dated 1979\u20131980), ''Judge Dredd'' (1980\u20131994) and ''Rogue Trooper'' (1990).\n* An annual summer special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996, entitled the ''2000AD Sci-Fi Special'' from 1978. This was revived in 2014.\n* Other specials include the ''2000AD Winter Special'' (1988\u20131995, 2005 and 2014), ''Judge Dredd Mega Special'' (1988\u20131996) and ''Rogue Trooper Action Special'' (1996). (1996's ''Judge Dredd Action Special'' was a tie-in to the defunct ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'' rather than ''2000AD'' proper).\n* In April 1992, a ''2000AD Action Special'' featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the [[Steel Claw]]. Of these only ''Kelly's Eye'' also appeared in ''2000 AD'' proper.\n* In the mid-1990s a series of ''2000 AD Poster Progs'' were published, each featuring a new strip. There were five ''Judge Dredd'' poster magazines, plus one each for four other ''2000 AD'' series: ''Nemesis the Warlock'', ''Strontium Dogs'', ''Sl\u00e1ine'' and ''Rogue Trooper''.\n* A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by [[Eagle Comics]] with the first issue of an ongoing monthly ''Judge Dredd'' title. Eagle Comics also reprinted other ''2000 AD'' material in other titles. The license to reprint ''2000 AD'' material in the US was later taken over by [[Quality Communications|Quality Comics]]. These reprints ended in the early 1990s.\n\n===Fanzines===\n''2000 AD'' has an extremely lively and thriving [[Fan (aficionado)|fanbase]], which has produced a number of independent [[fanzine]]s.\n\nBetween 1994\u201396, \"Fear The Badge\" was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a ''2000 AD'' fanzine based around the Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-hunter universes. With original artwork, stories and articles, the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics.\nIts editor/creator, Paul Dick, partially disabled himself, wanted to donate some of the zine's profits to a different disability charity each month. However, the fanzine's genesis was plagued by bad luck, not least of all Dick's health worsening. Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator (as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional ''2000 AD'' contributors), the fanzine's full potential sadly never was realised. Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced.\n\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using ''2000 AD'' copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled ''[[Class of '79]]'', named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators [[Rufus Dayglo]], [[Boo Cook]], [[Henry Flint]] and [[PJ Holden]] and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrew J. Lewis (comics)|Andrew J. Lewis]] created ''[[Zarjaz]]'' comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of ''2000 AD'' stories. There were also interviews with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], [[Frazer Irving]] and [[Alan Moore]], as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\n\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is ''[[Dogbreath]]'', originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, [[Arthur Wyatt (comics)|Arthur Wyatt]] created ''[[FutureQuake]]'', a fanzine devoted to the [[Future Shocks]] format. Although ''Class of '79'' now appears to be on hiatus, all three of the other titles are in continuous publication, ''Zarjaz'' having started up again with a new issue 1.\n\nIn addition, a number of [[British small press comics|small press]] comics have emerged from the ''2000 AD'' fanbase, including ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Omnivistascope'' and ''[[The End Is Nigh]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2000 AD stories]]\n*[[List of minor 2000 AD stories]]\n*''[[Action (comic)|Action]]''\n*[[British comics]]\n*[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]], which saw a number of ''2000 AD'' artists and writers working for the big American firms during the 1980s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] (2002\u20132003), ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]!''

As a [[comics anthology]] it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\")<ref group=note>Prog: short for \"programme\" as issues are supposedly beamed directly to the printed page.</ref> and was first published by [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]] in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. IPC then shifted the title to its [[Fleetway]] comics subsidiary, which was sold to [[Robert Maxwell]] in 1987 and then to [[Egmont UK]] in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\n''2000 AD'' is most noted for its ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. Other characters in ''2000 AD'' include ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and the ''[[ABC Warriors]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970s===\n\n====Pre-publication====\nIn December 1975, [[Kelvin Gosnell]], a sub-editor at [[IPC Media|IPC Magazines]], read an article in the [[Evening Standard|London Evening Standard]] about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC asked [[Pat Mills]], a [[freelance]] writer and [[editing|editor]] who had created ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]'' and ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer [[John Wagner]] on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name ''2000 AD'' was chosen by the publisher, John Sanders,<ref name=\":0\">Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books).</ref>{{Rp|pp.25\u201326}} as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|p.37}}\n\nMills' experiences with ''Battle'' and Action in particular had taught him that readers responded to his [[anti-authoritarian]] attitudes. Wagner, who had written a [[Dirty Harry]]-inspired tough cop called ''[[One-Eyed Jack (comics)|One-Eyed Jack]]'' for ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'', saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future [[New York City|New York]] with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. Meanwhile, Mills had developed a [[horror fiction|horror]] strip, inspired by the novels of [[Dennis Wheatley]], about a [[hanging judge]], called ''Judge Dread'' (after the [[reggae]] and [[ska]] artist of the [[Judge Dread|same name]]). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\n\nThe task of visualising the newly named ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' was given to [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on ''Battle'', on a strip called ''Major Eazy''. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\n\nMills was reluctant to lose ''Judge Dredd'', and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that ''Dredd'' would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris, extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell,<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|pp.70\u201372}}<ref group=note>Harris also wrote two ''Future Shocks'' and one episode of ''M.A.C.H. One''. [http://2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=thrills&Comic=2000AD&Field=Writer&choice=peterha]</ref> and drawn by newcomer [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]. The strip debuted in prog 2.\n\nIPC owned the rights to ''[[Dan Dare]]'', and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned ''Dare'''s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\n\n====The opening line-up====\n\n''[[Dan Dare]]'' was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived several centuries in the future. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist [[Massimo Belardinelli]], whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few ''Dan Dare'' fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing ''Dan Dare'' and Belardinelli drawing the ''Harlem Heroes'' sequel ''Inferno''. When Gibbons took over ''Dan Dare'' in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"''Star Trek''\" style space opera.\n\nMills had also created ''[[Harlem Heroes]]'', about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', and the similarly-themed film [[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]] had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on ''Harlem Heroes'' by [[Trigo (comics)|Trigo]] was disappointing. Veteran British artists [[Ron Turner (artist)|Ron Turner]] and [[Barrie Mitchell]] were tried out, but the newcomer [[Dave Gibbons]] won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'' writer [[Tom Tully (comic writer)|Tom Tully]].\n\nThe other opening strips were ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', a super-powered secret agent inspired by ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''; ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter Bill Savage; and ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]'', a strip about [[Time travel|time-travelling]] cowboys farming [[dinosaur]]s for their meat.\n\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to [[Kelvin Gosnell]], whose idea the comic had been in the first place. Gosnell appeared as the fall guy in the Tharg [[Fumetti|photostrips]] that were a feature of the comic in its early years.\n\n====Early years====\nWagner returned to write ''Judge Dredd'', starting in prog 9. His \"[[The Robot Wars|Robot Wars]]\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]], and marked the point where ''Dredd'' became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.<ref>Jarman, Colin M. and Peter Acton (1995) ''Judge Dredd: The Mega-History'', Lennard Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85291-128-X}}, p. 58</ref> Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as [[Mega-City One]]. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a 'censored' banner slapped on it. After this Dredd's face was never attempted to be shown again.\n\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 ''[[Future Shocks|Tharg's Future Shocks]]'', one-off twist-in-the-tail stories devised by writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]]. ''2000 AD'' still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\n\nWagner introduced a new character, ''[[Robo-Hunter]]'', in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a [[private detective]]-type character specialising in [[robot]]-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a [[Cuba]]n robot [[cigar]], Stogie, designed to help him cut down on [[nicotine]].\n\nOther ongoing strips included ''The Visible Man'', detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and ''Shako'', (which followed the same formula as ''Hook Jaw'' from ''Action'' but with less success) the story of a [[polar bear]] pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\n''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'' was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, ''M.A.C.H. Zero'', continued into the 1980s. ''Flesh'' had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, ''Disaster 1990'', in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\n\nIn 1977 ''2000 AD'' launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full length ''M.A.C.H. Zero'' story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 and would continue till 1991.\n\nPat Mills took over writing ''Dredd'' for a six-month \"epic\" called \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\", inspired by [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Damnation Alley]]'', which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by [[Brian Bolland]]. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while ''Dan Dare'' was given the front page.\n\nIPC had launched a second science fiction comic, ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', which was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into ''2000 AD'' from prog 86.<ref>[https://michaelowencarroll.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/eaglution-of-british-comics-part-1/ ''The Eaglution of British Comics''] by Michael Carroll, 26 May 2018. (Retrieved 27 May 2018.)</ref> As Gosnell was editor of ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' at the same time, ''2000 AD'' sub-editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the latter comic himself during this time.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\">\"A brief history of Starlord\" from \"Watch the stars!\" website {{cite web|url=http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Starlord |accessdate=10 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128232417/http://www.watchthestars.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/history/history.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 }}</ref> Two ''Starlord'' strips strengthened ''2000 AD'''s line-up: ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[bounty hunter]] created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a robot disaster squad created by Mills. ''Ro-Busters'' gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. ''Strontium Dog'' and ''ABC Warriors'' continued to feature in ''2000 AD'' for the next 40 years. (A third ''Starlord'' series, ''Timequake'', only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) ''Dan Dare'' was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to ''Dredd'' following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane [[Judge Cal|Chief Judge Cal]], based on the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]]. Another cancelled title, ''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'', was merged with ''2000 AD'' a few months later from prog 127, contributing three stories to ''2000 AD'': ''[[Blackhawk (Tornado)|Blackhawk]]'', an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman empire which took a science-fictional turn in ''2000 AD'' with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; ''[[The Mind of Wolfie Smith]]'', a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and ''Captain Klep'', a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike ''Starlord's'', did not continue for very long.\n\n''2000 AD'' featured an adaptation of [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s novel ''[[The Stainless Steel Rat]]'', written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'' and ''The Stainless Steel Rat for President'', would follow later.   The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on [[James Coburn]], evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for ''[[Major Eazy]]'', which Ezquerra drew in ''Battle,'' as well as ''Judge Koburn'', a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003.  [[Gerry Finley-Day]] contributed ''[[The V.C.s]]'', a future war story inspired by the [[Vietnam War]], drawn by McMahon, [[Cam Kennedy]], [[Garry Leach]] and [[John Richardson (comics)|John Richardson]].\n\nA feature of the early years of ''2000 AD'' was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n\n[[Steve MacManus]] took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980 ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' gained a new enemy. Writer [[John Wagner]] realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was [[Judge Death]], an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by [[Brian Bolland]] which also introduced [[Judge Anderson]] and [[Psi Division]], a squad of judges with psychic powers.\n\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"[[Judge Child|The Judge Child]]\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to [[Texas City]], and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the [[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]], was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, [[Ron Smith (artist)|Ron Smith]] and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]. The pair would go on to write ''Strontium Dog'', ''Robo-Hunter'' and many other stories for ''2000 AD'', as well as for ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' and the relaunched ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\n\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of Judge Dredd, were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of [[Mean Arena]], set around a violent high-tech street football game, [[Meltdown Man]], whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of [[Strontium Dog]], featuring a mutant bounty hunter character inherited from the short-lived ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' title, and [[Dash Decent]], a  [[Flash Gordon]] [[parody]].\n\n[[Pat Mills]] introduced ''Comic Rock'', which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by [[The Jam]]'s ''Going Underground'', was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called [[Nemesis the Warlock|Nemesis]] battles the despotic [[Torquemada (comics)|Torquemada]], chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in ''Ro-Busters'', which management objected to.\n\nThe only other ''Comic Rock'' story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a [[Teleportation|teleport]] system. This led to a series, ''Nemesis the Warlock'', in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future, Torquemada was a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on ''2000 AD'' pay. He left to work for [[DC Comics]] in America, and was replaced on ''Nemesis'' by first [[Jesus Redondo]] and then [[Bryan Talbot]].\n\n''2000 AD'' would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, ''[[Fiends of the Eastern Front]]'' was a World War II [[vampire]] story by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] which was probably originally intended for ''Battle''. Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his [[Romania]]n allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\n\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor [[Steve MacManus]] and artists Dave Gibbons devised ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'', a \"[[G.I. (comics)|Genetic Infantryman]]\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]], [[Brett Ewins]] and  [[Cam Kennedy]]. Rogue Trooper replaced [[Meltdown Man]], which had recently ended its run.\n\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] craze, was ''[[Ace Trucking Co.]]'', a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\n\nIn the ''Judge Dredd'' series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size.  \"[[Block Mania]]\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"[[Apocalypse War|The Apocalypse War]]\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of [[Mutually assured destruction]]. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\n\nA new writer, [[Alan Moore]], had started contributing ''[[Future Shocks]]'' in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various [[Marvel UK]] titles and the independent magazine ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. In 1982 he gained his first series, ''[[Skizz]]'', a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', set in [[Birmingham]] and influenced by [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. The series was drawn by [[Jim Baikie]].\n\nMoore wrote another series, ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', spun off from a one-off ''Time Twister''. Drawn by [[Alan Davis]], the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]'' with artist [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\n\nA new character, ''[[Sl\u00e1ine (comics)|Sl\u00e1ine]]'', debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by [[Pat Mills]] and his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]], ''Sl\u00e1ine'' was a barbarian [[fantasy]] strip based on [[Celtic mythology]]. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\n\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in ''Judge Dredd'', ''[[Judge Anderson]]'' finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist [[Glenn Fabry]] debuted on ''Sl\u00e1ine'', but due to his notorious slowness was rotated with [[David Pugh (comics)|David Pugh]]. In the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#\"Letter From a Democrat\": The martyrdom of Hester Hyman|Letter from a Democrat]]\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a [[police state]]. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\n\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, ''Sl\u00e1ine the King'', began, entirely drawn by Fabry. [[Peter Milligan]], a writer who had been contributing ''Future Shocks'', began two series, the bleak future war story ''[[Bad Company (comics)|Bad Company]]'' and a strange, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] series called ''The Dead''. In 1986, ''2000 AD'' was selling  150,000 copies a week.\n\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate [[Robert Maxwell]] as Fleetway. ''2000 AD'' was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. [[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]] became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short ''Nemesis'' series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'', ''2000 AD'''s first serious superhero strip, by new writer [[Grant Morrison]] and artist [[Steve Yeowell]]. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] elder gods.\n\nWagner and Grant began a new ''Dredd'' Epic, \"[[Oz (Judge Dredd story)|Oz]]\", featuring [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the [[Judda]], a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was ''[[The Last American]]'', a mini series for [[Epic Comics]] which would mark the end)  in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept ''Dredd'', while Grant continued ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Anderson''. However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\n\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by [[Colin MacNeil]].\n\nThe ''ABC Warriors'' finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from ''Nemesis''. This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer [[Simon Bisley]] and science fiction artist [[SMS (comics)|S.M.S.]].\n\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new ''Strontium Dog'' story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\n\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for ''Judge Dredd'', but were later given over to a new ''Sl\u00e1ine'' story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by [[Simon Bisley]]. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\n\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was ''Rogue Trooper: the War Machine'', written by Dave Gibbons and painted by [[Will Simpson (comics)|Will Simpson]]. The original ''Rogue Trooper'' series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the 'Hit' series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, [[Friday (2000 AD)|Friday]], in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\n\nOne of the black and white stories, \"[[The Dead Man]]\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n\n===1990s===\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new ''Judge Dredd'' story, \"[[The Dead Man#Tale of the Dead Man|Tale of the Dead Man]]\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]], the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the '[[The Long Walk (Judge Dredd)|Long Walk]]' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\n\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"[[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\n''2000 AD'' gained an influx of talent from other comics. [[Garth Ennis]] and [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] had come to prominence writing for ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a ''2000 AD'' spin-off for older readers, while artists [[Jamie Hewlett]] and [[Philip Bond]] were the stars of ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]'', an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Brett Ewins]]. Smith created ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a [[time travel]] story featuring [[Jack the Ripper]]. [[Garth Ennis]] and Philip Bond contributed ''Time Flies'', a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer [[Peter Milligan]] for the surreal ''[[Hewligan's Haircut]]''. Writer [[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] and artist [[Simon Jacob]] created ''[[Armoured Gideon]]'', an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\n\nThe ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\n\nAmerican writer [[Michael Fleisher]], who had written ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' and ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new ''Rogue Trooper'', along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set ''2000 AD'' on fire was [[Mark Millar]], whose revival of ''Robo-Hunter'' was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]''.\n\n''2000 AD'' went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, ''[[Toxic!]]'', launched by Pat Mills and many of the core ''2000 AD'' team of creators. ''Toxic!'' only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for ''2000 AD''. ''[[Button Man]]'', a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and [[Arthur Ranson]], was originally intended for ''Toxic!'' but ended up in ''2000 AD''.\n\nA new ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by [[Kev Walker]], began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\n\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company which owned rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\n\nIn 1992, ''2000 AD'' and the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' ran their first crossover story, \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", in which [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]s overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, [[Peter Doherty (comics)|Peter Doherty]], [[Dean Ormston]] and [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]], the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist [[Paul Marshall (comics)|Paul Marshall]] created ''[[Firekind]]'', a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\n\nThe ''Strontium Dog'' world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name ''Strontium Dogs'' \u2013 characters such as female vampire [[Durham Red]], the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak 'heartses', became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter ''The Darkest Star'', it transpires that the one to ''actually'' kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\n\n{{anchor|Summer Offensive}}<!-- [[Summer Offensive (comics)]] links here -->\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor [[Alan McKenzie]] gave free rein to writers [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, ''[[Really & Truly]]''. Smith contributed ''[[Slaughterbowl]]'', in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote ''[[Maniac 5]]'', an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] attitudes titled ''[[Big Dave (comics)|Big Dave]]'', written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]].\n\n[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]] became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine'', \"[[Mechanismo|Wilderlands]]\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, [[Mick Austin]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]], it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the ''Megazine'' in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, ''Judge Dredd'' was again the flagship strip.\n\nFormer ''Megazine'' editor [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] introduced ''[[Sinister Dexter]]'' in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer [[Robbie Morrison]] and artist [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]], who had worked with Bishop on the ''Megazine'', created ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'', a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, ''[[The Spacegirls]]'', a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the [[Spice Girls]], ''[[M.A.C.H. 1|B.L.A.I.R. 1]]'', a parody of [[Tony Blair]] based on ''[[M.A.C.H. 1]]'', and an adaptation of the [[Danny Boyle]] film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]''.\n\nA new ''Dredd'' epic, \"[[The Doomsday Scenario|Doomsday]]\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both ''2000 AD'' and the ''Megazine''. Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like [[Judge Edgar]] of the Public Surveillance Unit, and [[Galen DeMarco]], a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n\n1999 also saw the return of another character, ''Nemesis the Warlock''. After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by [[Henry Flint]] in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's ''ABC Warriors'' work.\n\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, ''Nemesis'' wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in ''Nikolai Dante'', and writer [[Gordon Rennie]] and artist [[Mark Harrison (artist)|Mark Harrison]] introduced future war story ''Glimmer Rats''. Another old favourite, ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n\n===2000s===\nThe publisher has been owned by [[Rebellion Developments]] since 2000, with editors [[Andy Diggle]] and [[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]] at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd]]'', and has also introduced a roster of new series including ''[[Shakara]]'', ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. It has also published a tie-in to the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' in a story written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]].\n\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including [[Boo Cook]], [[Dom Reardon]] and [[Al Ewing]]. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound [[exchange rate]] that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\n\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including ''[[London Falling]]'', ''[[Stone Island (2000AD)|Stone Island]]'' and ''[[Zombo (comics)|Zombo]]''. Other developments include a revamping of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' which has included a section acting as a showcase for [[British small press comics]]. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a 'prelude' to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\n\nIn prog 1526,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=prog&page=profiles&choice=1526 |title=Prog 1526 |publisher=2000ad.org |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> dated 28 February 2007, ''2000 AD'' celebrated their 30th anniversary.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6390731.stm 30 years of the future], [[BBC]], 26 February 2007</ref> The issue saw the start of two new storylines: ''[[Nikolai Dante]]'' (by [[Robbie Morrison]] and [[Simon Fraser (comics)|Simon Fraser]]) and ''[[Invasion!

Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History''. Later in that year, [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette Partworks]] began publishing ''[[2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection]]'', an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. This followed the success of ''[[Judge Dredd: The Mega Collection]]'', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\n\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the ''2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018'', which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/the-futures-female-2000ads-all-women-special \"The future's female? 2000AD's all-women special\"], by David Barnett, in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 June 2018.</ref>\n\n==Lists of stories==\n{{Main|List of 2000 AD stories}}\n*A complete index of stories published in ''2000 AD'' from February 1977 to December 2019 (#1 to #2162) is [[Media:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]] (WikiCommons).<ref>[[commons:File:Index of every story published in British comic 2000AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n*A more detailed list of all the ''Judge Dredd'' stories to appear in ''2000 AD'' (including specials and annuals) from March 1977 to December 2019 can be found [[Media:Dredd2AD.pdf|here (.pdf file)]].<ref>[[commons:File:Dredd2AD.pdf|File description page at WikiCommons]]</ref>\n\n==Crossovers==\n{{main|2000 AD crossovers}}\nAlthough there is no overall [[shared universe]] containing all ''2000 AD'' stories, some stories [[2000 AD crossovers|spin-off or crossover]] into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the [[Judge Dredd|Judge Dredd universe]]. Many stories by [[Pat Mills]], which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by the writer. Many stories written by [[Ian Edginton]] feature shared themes and references.\n\n==Editors==\n{{Main|Tharg the Mighty}}\nA long-running theme is that the [[editing|editor]] of ''2000 AD'' is [[Tharg the Mighty]], a green [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from [[Betelgeuse]] who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229.  In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre.  In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Eathlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender.  From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.<ref>Prog 531, 18 July 1987 \u2013 \"Earthlette H Maton\"</ref>\n\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of [[robot]]s to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life [[industrial action]] that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s). Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself, but when he ran it through the quality-control \"Thrill-meter\", the device melted down on extreme overload. The offending issue had to be taken away, by blindfolded security guards, to a lead-lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally.\n<section begin=tharg />\nThe role of Tharg has been performed by the following editors:\n\n#[[Pat Mills]], #1\u201316 (1977)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=patm Pat Mills] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Kelvin Gosnell]], #17\u201385 (1977\u20131978)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=KELVING Kelvin Gosnell] at 2000ad.org</ref><br/>Assistant editor [[Nick Landau]] largely edited the comic himself in 1978 while Gosnell was occupied with editing new sister title ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]''.<ref name=\"WPCleanerAuto1\"/>\n#[[Steve MacManus]], #86\u2013519 (1978\u20131987)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=STEVEM Steve MacManus] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Richard Burton (comics)|Richard Burton]], #520\u2013872 (1987\u20131994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=RICHARDB Richard Burton] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Alan McKenzie]], #873\u2013914 (1994)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ALANMC Alan McKenzie] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[John Tomlinson (comics)|John Tomlinson]], #915\u2013977 (1994\u20131996)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=JOHNT John Tomlinson] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]], #978\u20131199 (1996\u20132000)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=DAVEB David Bishop (writer)|] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Andy Diggle]], #1200\u20131273 (2000\u20132002)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=ANDYD Andy Diggle] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n#[[Matt Smith (comics editor)|Matt Smith]], #1274\u2013present (2002\u2013present)<ref>[http://www.2000ad.org/?zone=droid&page=profiles&choice=MATTS Matt Smith] at 2000ad.org</ref>\n<section end=tharg />\n\n==Contributors==\n[[File:Drandquinch.jpg|thumb|200px|''D.R and Quinch'', art by [[Alan Davis]].]]\nWell known contributors to ''2000 AD'' include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[Nick Abadzis]]\n* [[Dan Abnett]]\n* [[Massimo Belardinelli]]\n* [[Simon Bisley]]\n* [[Brian Bolland]]\n* [[Philip Bond]]\n* [[Chris Cunningham]]\n* [[Alan Davis]]\n* [[Steve Dillon]]\n* [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]]\n* [[Ian Edginton]]\n* [[Garth Ennis]]\n* [[Al Ewing]]\n* [[Carlos Ezquerra]]\n* [[Gerry Finley-Day]]\n* [[Michael Fleisher]]\n* [[Henry Flint]]\n* [[Tom Frame (letterer)|Tom Frame]]\n* [[Neil Gaiman]]\n* [[Dave Gibbons]]\n* [[Ian Gibson (artist)|Ian Gibson]]\n* [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]\n* [[Trevor Hairsine]]\n* [[Jamie Hewlett]]\n* [[John Hicklenton]]\n* [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]\n* [[David Hine]]\n* [[Frazer Irving]]\n* [[Jock (comics)|Jock]]\n* [[Cam Kennedy]]\n* [[Brendan McCarthy]]\n* [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]]\n* [[Mark Millar]]\n* [[Peter Milligan]]\n* [[Pat Mills]]\n* [[Alan Moore]]\n* [[Grant Morrison]]\n* [[Robbie Morrison]]\n* [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]\n* [[Arthur Ranson]]\n* [[Gordon Rennie]]\n* [[John Ridgway (comics)|John Ridgway]]\n* [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]]\n* [[Ron Smith (comics)|Ron Smith]]\n* [[Simon Spurrier]]\n* [[Richard Starkings]]\n* [[Bryan Talbot]]\n* [[John Wagner]]\n* [[Kev Walker]]\n* [[Chris Weston]]\n{{colend}}\nMany of these have since moved on to work for American publishers such as [[DC Comics]] (especially the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] and [[Wildstorm]] imprints) and [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Film and TV adaptations==\n* ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Dredd]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Rogue Trooper#Film|Rogue Trooper]]'' (TBA)<ref>{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/duncan-jones-teases-rogue-trooper-movie-1127099|title=Duncan Jones Teases 'Rogue Trooper' Movie|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=15 July 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}</ref>\n*''[[Judge Dredd#Television|Judge Dredd: Mega-City One]] (TBA)\n\n==Video game adaptations==\n2000AD video games for 8-bit computers include games based on [[Strontium Dog]] by [[Quicksilva]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984, ''Nemesis the Warlock'' and ''Sl\u00e1ine'' by [[Martech]] in 1987, [[Rogue Trooper]] written by [[Design Design]] / published by ''Piranha'' in 1986 and [[Judge Dredd]] by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] in 1990, all released for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] platforms.

to ''2000 AD'' is the monthly  ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', which originally focused exclusively on expanding the world of Judge Dredd, but in recent years has expanded its focus to include other stories set in other universes as well.\n* The bimonthly ''2000 AD Extreme Edition'' presented reprints of classic and hard-to-find 2000AD stories, but poor sales led to its cancellation in mid-2008. Since the cancellation, a smaller reprint supplement has been packaged with the ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' instead.\n*''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'' was a weekly title (originally intended to be monthly) launched in 1978 following much the same format as ''2000 AD'' and included ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' and ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' which introduced characters that would later reappear in ''[[ABC Warriors]]''. The two titles were merged later the same year and published as ''2000AD and Starlord''. A third ''Starlord'' series, ''TimeQuake'', also had a 4-week run in ''2000AD'' over a year later.\n*''[[Tornado (comic)|Tornado]]'' was a weekly title launched in 1979. There was less emphasis on Science Fiction series. It was merged with ''2000 AD'' after 22 issues, transferring the strips ''[[Blackhawk (UK comic)|Blackhawk]]'', ''The Mind of Wolfie Smith'' and ''Captain Klep''. For a while the publication was titled ''2000 AD and Tornado''.\n*''[[Diceman (comics)|Diceman]]'' was an early attempt at creating a [[role-playing]] comic featuring regular ''2000 AD'' characters such as Rogue Trooper and Slaine, as well as original characters, like Diceman. The magazine was not a success and only lasted five issues.\n*''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' (1988\u20131991) was a sister publication that did not follow the format of ''2000 AD'', but did share many editorial staff and creative teams. Early issues featured two SF-themed stories aimed at a slightly older age group than ''2000 AD'' with strong political themes. It became a magnet for British creators who wanted to create comics for the adult market. The ''2000 AD'' series ''Finn'', begun the year after ''Crisis'' was cancelled, continued the adventures of the character from ''Third World War'', though with more of a fantasy emphasis.\n*''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]'' (1990\u20131991) joined ''Crisis'' though it only lasted for seven issues. Dan Dare was in the original line-up, and this transferred to ''Crisis'' when ''Revolver'' finished.\n*''[[Toxic!]]'' was a short-lived rival publication, established by ''2000 AD'' talent, that was published during 1991.\n*A ''Best of 2000 AD'' title was published in the mid-1980s which featured reprint material from early issues of ''2000 AD''. In the early 1990s, ''The Complete Judge Dredd'' began publication in a similar format. Both titles were relaunched as ''Classic 2000AD'' and ''Classic Judge Dredd'' in the mid-1990s but were cancelled soon after.\n*A yearly hardcover annual was published from 1977 to 1990 (though the cover dates on the annuals were always the following year). From 1991 this was replaced by a softcover ''2000AD Yearbook''; the last of these was published in 1994. There were also annuals/yearbooks dedicated to ''2000 AD'' characters such as ''Dan Dare'' (1978\u20131979, cover dated 1979\u20131980), ''Judge Dredd'' (1980\u20131994) and ''Rogue Trooper'' (1990).\n* An annual summer special was published during the summer months between 1977 and 1996, entitled the ''2000AD Sci-Fi Special'' from 1978. This was revived in 2014.\n* Other specials include the ''2000AD Winter Special'' (1988\u20131995, 2005 and 2014), ''Judge Dredd Mega Special'' (1988\u20131996) and ''Rogue Trooper Action Special'' (1996). (1996's ''Judge Dredd Action Special'' was a tie-in to the defunct ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'' rather than ''2000AD'' proper).\n* In April 1992, a ''2000AD Action Special'' featured six strips reviving classic British comics characters such as the [[Steel Claw]]. Of these only ''Kelly's Eye'' also appeared in ''2000 AD'' proper.\n* In the mid-1990s a series of ''2000 AD Poster Progs'' were published, each featuring a new strip. There were five ''Judge Dredd'' poster magazines, plus one each for four other ''2000 AD'' series: ''Nemesis the Warlock'', ''Strontium Dogs'', ''Sl\u00e1ine'' and ''Rogue Trooper''.\n* A series of American comic format reprints started in 1983 by [[Eagle Comics]] with the first issue of an ongoing monthly ''Judge Dredd'' title. Eagle Comics also reprinted other ''2000 AD'' material in other titles. The license to reprint ''2000 AD'' material in the US was later taken over by [[Quality Communications|Quality Comics]]. These reprints ended in the early 1990s.\n\n===Fanzines===\n''2000 AD'' has an extremely lively and thriving [[Fan (aficionado)|fanbase]], which has produced a number of independent [[fanzine]]s.\n\nBetween 1994\u201396, \"Fear The Badge\" was an erstwhile but overly ambitious attempt at a ''2000 AD'' fanzine based around the Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-hunter universes. With original artwork, stories and articles, the fanzine would act as a showcase for talent wanting to break into comics.\nIts editor/creator, Paul Dick, partially disabled himself, wanted to donate some of the zine's profits to a different disability charity each month. However, the fanzine's genesis was plagued by bad luck, not least of all Dick's health worsening. Despite the good intentions and hardwork of its creator (as well as the keen interest and support from both amateur and professional ''2000 AD'' contributors), the fanzine's full potential sadly never was realised. Only a dummy run of 50 copies of issue 1 were ever produced.\n\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using ''2000 AD'' copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled ''[[Class of '79]]'', named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators [[Rufus Dayglo]], [[Boo Cook]], [[Henry Flint]] and [[PJ Holden]] and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\n\nIn 2001, [[Andrew J. Lewis (comics)|Andrew J. Lewis]] created ''[[Zarjaz]]'' comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of ''2000 AD'' stories. There were also interviews with [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], [[Frazer Irving]] and [[Alan Moore]], as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\n\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is ''[[Dogbreath]]'', originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, [[Arthur Wyatt (comics)|Arthur Wyatt]] created ''[[FutureQuake]]'', a fanzine devoted to the [[Future Shocks]] format. Although ''Class of '79'' now appears to be on hiatus, all three of the other titles are in continuous publication, ''Zarjaz'' having started up again with a new issue 1.\n\nIn addition, a number of [[British small press comics|small press]] comics have emerged from the ''2000 AD'' fanbase, including ''[[Solar Wind (comic)|Solar Wind]]'', ''Omnivistascope'' and ''[[The End Is Nigh]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2000 AD stories]]\n*[[List of minor 2000 AD stories]]\n*''[[Action (comic)|Action]]''\n*[[British comics]]\n*[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]], which saw a number of ''2000 AD'' artists and writers working for the big American firms during the 1980s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] (2002\u20132003), ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]!''

Chesler argues that many western intellectuals, including leftists and feminists, have abandoned Western values in the name of [[multicultural relativism]], and that this has led to an alliance with Islamists, an increase in anti-Semitism, and to the abandonment of Muslim women and religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries.\n\n== Personal life ==\nChesler was the eldest of three children raised in a working-class [[Orthodox Jewish]] family in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>McGinity, Keren R. \"Phyllis Chesler\".

Despite liberal feminist opposition, Chesler defended the rights of the birth mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, who wanted to keep her child even though the genetic father and his wife were a more educated and higher income couple.\n\n''The New York Times'' described this book as \"a powerful critique of the way many of us were inclined to think\". A ''Los Angeles Times'' reviewer wrote that ''Sacred Bond'' is \"a powerful, provocative book ... illustrating social problems sure to remain controversial\".<ref name=\"PCO\"/> The book and its views were also condemned by pro-surrogacy lobbies, pro-adoption lobbies, and by feminists who were concerned with maximizing their options in case of infertility. This issue remains timely and is frequently in the news.\n\n=== ''Patriarchy: Notes of an Expert Witness'' (1994) ===\nThis volume consists of several articles written by Chesler on topics such as the [[Aileen Wuornos]], [[Baby M]], child abuse, treatment of women in mental health institutions, and patriarchy.

She wanted to share the history of her generation of feminists with coming generations and to point to work still left undone. The work was lauded by feminists of her era and mocked or minimized by daughter-generation feminists who did not want to keep standing on the shoulders of a previous generation with whom they disagreed and with whom they were in competition.\n\nThe ''Chicago Tribune'' described this as \"a frank assessment of the past and a radical recipe for the future\".<ref name=\"PCO\"/> ''The New York Times'' felt much of the advice was unnecessary since \"Feminism's daughters have outgrown their bunk beds\". The reviewer found the book \"strident\" and fails to reach younger feminists but concedes that \"Chesler does an admirable job.

For example, [[Susan Brownmiller]] wrote, \"The sweet, clear voice of these Letters should reach across the generation gap like Joshua's trumpet.

The book was reviewed in many publications, and the author was interviewed widely in South America, North America (including in ''The New York Times''),<ref>Felicia R. Lee, \"Women Are Nurturing? How about Cruel, Especially to One Another\", ''The New York Times'', August 24, 2002</ref> Europe, and Asia. It received a front-page review in the ''Washington Post'' Book World written by Deborah Tannen. Tannen wrote: \"Chesler seems to have read everything and thought deeply about it....Along with social commentary and psychological insight, Chesler offers astute literary criticism....many of Chesler's richest scenarios are drawn from the more than 500 interviews she conducted ... many of Chesler's examples have an unmistakable and heartbreaking ring of familiarity. The time has come to stop idealizing or demonizing either sex. Seeing women, like men, as capable of both courage and jealousy, of providing care, and causing pain, is no more nor less than acknowledging women as fully human.\"<ref>Deborah Tannen, rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', Washington Post, March 10, 2002.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the book was reviewed in ''Salon'',<ref>Rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', Salon.com, March 29, 2002</ref> ''Publishers Weekly'',<ref>Rev. of Woman's Inhumanity to Woman, ''Publishers Weekly''. http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56025-351-8</ref> and ''Kirkus Reviews''.<ref>Rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', ''Kirkus Reviews'', January 15, 2002.</ref>\n\n=== ''The New Anti-Semitism'' (2003) ===\nChesler's ''The New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We Must Do About It'' was issued in 2003.

A 2003 review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' argued that the book \"too often undercuts itself when its author intends to be provocative\", citing lines such as \"African-Americans (not Jews) are the Jews in America but Jews are the world's niggers.\" The review piece concluded that \"Chesler's tone and lack of intellectual rigor will not help her ideas to be heard by those who do not already agree with her.\"<ref>\"The New Anti-Semitism: The current Crisis and What We Must Do About It?

She argues that their desire to avoid being labeled \"racists\" or \"Islamophobes\" eventually trumped their concern with women's and human rights in the Third World. The ''Death of Feminism'' was excerpted in ''Playboy'' magazine,<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"Gender Apartheid\", ''Playboy'', November 1, 2005.</ref> but she was also interviewed by the ''Washington Times'', and positively reviewed in the pages of ''The Weekly Standard'' and ''The National Review''.\n\nKirkus called it a \"loud wake up call ... a fierce polemic, filled with vigorous arguments and distressing human stories\".<ref>Kirkus Reviews, rev. of ''The Death of Feminism'', September 12, 2005.</ref> ''Publishers Weekly'' wrote: \"She has penned a cross between a ''[[:wikt:cri de coeur|cri di coeur]]'' and a deeply rhetorical polemic that makes scores of provocative points....

In 2006, Chesler participated at the First Muslim Dissident Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida, which she covered for the ''Times'' of London.\n\n=== ''Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody'' (2011) ===\nIn 2011, Chicago Review Press published a 25th anniversary edition of Chesler's 1986 book ''Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody'', in which she argues that the American legal system is biased and overworked and continues to fail the needs of mothers and children, especially those whose husbands and fathers are violent and vindictive. She discusses topics such as prolonged litigation, joint custody, court enabled incest, brainwashing, kidnapping, gay and lesbian custody, fathers' rights groups, and international child custody laws. The new edition includes a new introduction and eight new chapters.

She identified the first group as consisting of daughters with an average age of seventeen who were killed by their families, and the second group as consisting of women with an average age of thirty-six. In her most recent essay, Chesler asserts that both Hindus and Muslims commit honor killings, but that only Muslims do so worldwide.\n\nChesler argues that honor killings differ qualitatively from Western domestic femicide. She has acknowledged that \"many honorable feminists\" disagree with this position, writing that \"understandably, such feminists fear singling out one group for behavior that may be common to all groups\". Chesler's position is that perpetrators of domestically violent femicide are regarded as criminals in the west, but that the same stigma does not attach to honor killings in other societies.<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"The Sisterhood's most Important Struggle\", ''National Post'', March 12, 2011, A28.</ref>\n\nAs a result of her observations about Islam and honor killing, Muslim and left-wing activists successfully lobbied the University of Arkansas to remove Chesler from an academic conference on honor killing because they did not approve of her coverage of the subject.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/258440/honor-killing-phyllis-chesler|title=Honor Killing Phyllis Chesler|last=|first=|date=2017-04-27|website=Tablet Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> In an address before the [[New York County Supreme Court]], Chesler reported that she has submitted affidavits on behalf of Muslim women and converts from Islam whom she contends believed themselves to be in danger of being the victims of honor killing, and who sought asylum and citizenship in the United States.<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"[http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/03/08/100th-anniversary-international-womens-day-feminists-doing-honor-killings/ On the 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day \u2013 What Are Feminists Doing About Honor Killings?]\" Fox News, March 8, 2011.</ref>\n\n;Burqas\n\nIn 2010, Chesler published an essay in ''Middle East Quarterly'' calling for the [[burqa]] to be banned in western countries. She argued in defense of this position that despite the [[Qur'an|Qur'an's]] command to both men and women to dress \"modestly\", several Muslim-majority countries have, in the past, banned the full [[burqa]] or [[niqab]]. She argued that that the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries do not require that women wear a face veil and noted hat the burqa can function as a \"sensory deprivation and isolation chamber.\" \n\nIn addition, Chesler has written that she is not opposed to the Islamic veil (hijab, headscarf) because it does not obscure a woman's facial identity. However, she also notes that there is a connection between a range of physical and psychiatric illnesses associated with forced veiling; these include the visible subordination of women, as well as the obvious lack of sunlight. However, she has also said she is not opposed to the Islamic headscarf (hijab), .<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"Ban the Burqa? The Argument in Favor\".

Despite liberal feminist opposition, Chesler defended the rights of the birth mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, who wanted to keep her child even though the genetic father and his wife were a more educated and higher income couple.\n\n''The New York Times'' described this book as \"a powerful critique of the way many of us were inclined to think\". A ''Los Angeles Times'' reviewer wrote that ''Sacred Bond'' is \"a powerful, provocative book ... illustrating social problems sure to remain controversial\".<ref name=\"PCO\"/> The book and its views were also condemned by pro-surrogacy lobbies, pro-adoption lobbies, and by feminists who were concerned with maximizing their options in case of infertility.

She wanted to share the history of her generation of feminists with coming generations and to point to work still left undone. The work was lauded by feminists of her era and mocked or minimized by daughter-generation feminists who did not want to keep standing on the shoulders of a previous generation with whom they disagreed and with whom they were in competition.\n\nThe ''Chicago Tribune'' described this as \"a frank assessment of the past and a radical recipe for the future\".<ref name=\"PCO\"/> ''The New York Times'' felt much of the advice was unnecessary since \"Feminism's daughters have outgrown their bunk beds\". The reviewer found the book \"strident\" and fails to reach younger feminists but concedes that \"Chesler does an admirable job.

For example, [[Susan Brownmiller]] wrote, \"The sweet, clear voice of these Letters should reach across the generation gap like Joshua's trumpet.

The book was reviewed in many publications, and the author was interviewed widely in South America, North America (including in ''The New York Times''),<ref>Felicia R. Lee, \"Women Are Nurturing? How about Cruel, Especially to One Another\", ''The New York Times'', August 24, 2002</ref> Europe, and Asia. It received a front-page review in the ''Washington Post'' Book World written by Deborah Tannen. Tannen wrote: \"Chesler seems to have read everything and thought deeply about it....Along with social commentary and psychological insight, Chesler offers astute literary criticism....many of Chesler's richest scenarios are drawn from the more than 500 interviews she conducted ... many of Chesler's examples have an unmistakable and heartbreaking ring of familiarity. The time has come to stop idealizing or demonizing either sex. Seeing women, like men, as capable of both courage and jealousy, of providing care, and causing pain, is no more nor less than acknowledging women as fully human.\"<ref>Deborah Tannen, rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', Washington Post, March 10, 2002.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the book was reviewed in ''Salon'',<ref>Rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', Salon.com, March 29, 2002</ref> ''Publishers Weekly'',<ref>Rev. of Woman's Inhumanity to Woman, ''Publishers Weekly''. http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56025-351-8</ref> and ''Kirkus Reviews''.<ref>Rev. of ''Woman's Inhumanity to Woman'', ''Kirkus Reviews'', January 15, 2002.</ref>\n\n=== ''The New Anti-Semitism'' (2003) ===\nChesler's ''The New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We Must Do About It'' was issued in 2003.

She argues that their desire to avoid being labeled \"racists\" or \"Islamophobes\" eventually trumped their concern with women's and human rights in the Third World. The ''Death of Feminism'' was excerpted in ''Playboy'' magazine,<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"Gender Apartheid\", ''Playboy'', November 1, 2005.</ref> but she was also interviewed by the ''Washington Times'', and positively reviewed in the pages of ''The Weekly Standard'' and ''The National Review''.\n\nKirkus called it a \"loud wake up call ... a fierce polemic, filled with vigorous arguments and distressing human stories\".<ref>Kirkus Reviews, rev. of ''The Death of Feminism'', September 12, 2005.</ref> ''Publishers Weekly'' wrote: \"She has penned a cross between a ''[[:wikt:cri de coeur|cri di coeur]]'' and a deeply rhetorical polemic that makes scores of provocative points....

In 2006, Chesler participated at the First Muslim Dissident Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida, which she covered for the ''Times'' of London.\n\n=== ''Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody'' (2011) ===\nIn 2011, Chicago Review Press published a 25th anniversary edition of Chesler's 1986 book ''Mothers on Trial: The Battle for Children and Custody'', in which she argues that the American legal system is biased and overworked and continues to fail the needs of mothers and children, especially those whose husbands and fathers are violent and vindictive. She discusses topics such as prolonged litigation, joint custody, court enabled incest, brainwashing, kidnapping, gay and lesbian custody, fathers' rights groups, and international child custody laws.

She called for the U.S. government to oppose what she described as \"Islamic gender apartheid\", and to support the rights of women living in fundamentalist Islamic regimes. \"If we do not oppose and defeat Islamic gender apartheid, democracy and freedom cannot flourish in the Arab and Islamic world\", she said. \"If we do not join forces with Muslim dissident and feminist groups, and, above all, if we do not have one universal standard of human rights for all\u2014then we will fail our own Judeo-Christian and secular Western ideals.\" She also told the committee that her experience in Afghanistan taught her \"the necessity of applying a single standard of human rights, not one tailored to each culture\".<ref name=UPI>Kate Walker, \"[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2005/12/25/Moral-relativism-begets-gender-apartheid/UPI-36461135520760/ Moral relativism begets gender apartheid]\", UPI, December 25, 2005.</ref>\n\nChesler made statements critical of Islam in the context of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] in a 2007 interview with the ''[[Jewish Press]]''.

In one such essay, she wrote that 91% of the total worldwide cases of honour killings (as reported in English-language media) were Muslim-on-Muslim crimes, including those committed in North America and Europe.<ref name=HKMEF>Phyllis Chesler, \"Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence\", ''Middle East Quarterly'', Spring 2009; Phyllis Chesler, \"Worldwide Trends in Honor Killings\", ''Middle East Quarterly'', Spring 2010.</ref> Based on these sources, Chesler concluded that \"there are at least two types of honor killings and two victim populations\". She identified the first group as consisting of daughters with an average age of seventeen who were killed by their families, and the second group as consisting of women with an average age of thirty-six. In her most recent essay, Chesler asserts that both Hindus and Muslims commit honor killings, but that only Muslims do so worldwide.\n\nChesler argues that honor killings differ qualitatively from Western domestic femicide. She has acknowledged that \"many honorable feminists\" disagree with this position, writing that \"understandably, such feminists fear singling out one group for behavior that may be common to all groups\". Chesler's position is that perpetrators of domestically violent femicide are regarded as criminals in the west, but that the same stigma does not attach to honor killings in other societies.<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"The Sisterhood's most Important Struggle\", ''National Post'', March 12, 2011, A28.</ref>\n\nAs a result of her observations about Islam and honor killing, Muslim and left-wing activists successfully lobbied the University of Arkansas to remove Chesler from an academic conference on honor killing because they did not approve of her coverage of the subject.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/258440/honor-killing-phyllis-chesler|title=Honor Killing Phyllis Chesler|last=|first=|date=2017-04-27|website=Tablet Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> In an address before the [[New York County Supreme Court]], Chesler reported that she has submitted affidavits on behalf of Muslim women and converts from Islam whom she contends believed themselves to be in danger of being the victims of honor killing, and who sought asylum and citizenship in the United States.<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"[http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/03/08/100th-anniversary-international-womens-day-feminists-doing-honor-killings/ On the 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day \u2013 What Are Feminists Doing About Honor Killings?]\" Fox News, March 8, 2011.</ref>\n\n;Burqas\n\nIn 2010, Chesler published an essay in ''Middle East Quarterly'' calling for the [[burqa]] to be banned in western countries. She argued in defense of this position that despite the [[Qur'an|Qur'an's]] command to both men and women to dress \"modestly\", several Muslim-majority countries have, in the past, banned the full [[burqa]] or [[niqab]]. She argued that that the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries do not require that women wear a face veil and noted hat the burqa can function as a \"sensory deprivation and isolation chamber.\" \n\nIn addition, Chesler has written that she is not opposed to the Islamic veil (hijab, headscarf) because it does not obscure a woman's facial identity. However, she also notes that there is a connection between a range of physical and psychiatric illnesses associated with forced veiling; these include the visible subordination of women, as well as the obvious lack of sunlight. However, she has also said she is not opposed to the Islamic headscarf (hijab), .<ref>Phyllis Chesler, \"Ban the Burqa? The Argument in Favor\".
