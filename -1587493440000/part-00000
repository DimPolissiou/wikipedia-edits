Snapshot is a voluntary discount program where drivers can save money on their car insurance by sharing their driving habits with Progressive. According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.<ref name=\"progressive.com\">[http://www.progressive.com/snapshot/].</ref> Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot-how-it-works/</ref>\n\nDrivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they're eligible for a discount based on that 30-day \"snapshot\" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn't take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSnapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia.

According to Progressive, Snapshot is best for people who drive less, in safer ways and during safer times of day.<ref name=\"progressive.com\">[http://www.progressive.com/snapshot/].</ref> Snapshot customers can make changes to their driving habits that will lead to bigger discounts by checking their driving data and projected discount on progressive.com over the course of their initial policy period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot-how-it-works/</ref>\n\nDrivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they're eligible for a discount based on that 30-day \"snapshot\" of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn't take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSnapshot is currently available in 45 states plus the District of Columbia.

She has preserved precisely and authentically the teaching of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] in its pristine splendor and in all its purity. Over and above a simple, unbroken historical continuity and consistency there exists in her a spiritual and ontological authenticity. The same Faith, the same Spirit, the same life. It is this which constitutes the distinguishing feature of Orthodoxy and which justifies her claim that she is and remains The Church\" (''Episkepsis'', #227, 15 March 1980)...From the Orthodox point of view there is no justification for Optimism in regard to the dialogue, and for this reason no haste should be exhibited concerning it. The Roman Catholics are pressing the dialogue, hoping to strengthen themselves by annexing Orthodoxy to themselves, for they are confronted by very powerful internal disturbances and crises, as is well known. The number of former Roman Catholics who have converted to Orthodoxy also disturbs them. But Orthodoxy has no reason to hasten towards dialogue since the papists remain so obdurate and immovable as regards infallibility, uniatism, and the rest of their pernicious teachings. Hastening the dialogue under such conditions is equivalent to spiritual suicide for the Orthodox.\"<ref>''[http://www.impantokratoros.gr/conference-mountathos.en.aspx The Announcement of the Joint Conference of the Abbots of Mount Athos].'' 9\u201322 April 1980.</ref>|group=note}} Greek [[Hieromonk|priest-monk]] Fr.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of [[Greece]].\n\nChristianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], although the church's apostolicity also rests upon [[Saint Andrew|St. Andrew]] who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, [[Titus (Biblical)|Titus]], Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, [[Luke the Evangelist]] who was martyred in Thebes, [[Lazarus of Bethany]], Bishop of [[Kition]] in Cyprus, and [[John of Patmos|John the Theologian]] who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] recorded in the last book of the [[New Testament]]. In addition, the [[Theotokos]] is regarded as having visited the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]] in 49 AD according to [[Sacred tradition|tradition]].{{#tag:ref|The [[w:Theotokos|Theotokos]] is the Patron of Mount Athos, which is known as: '''The Garden of the Mother of God''', and '''The Holy Mountain of Our Lady'''.

It is this which constitutes the distinguishing feature of Orthodoxy and which justifies her claim that she is and remains The Church\" (''Episkepsis'', #227, 15 March 1980)...From the Orthodox point of view there is no justification for Optimism in regard to the dialogue, and for this reason no haste should be exhibited concerning it. The Roman Catholics are pressing the dialogue, hoping to strengthen themselves by annexing Orthodoxy to themselves, for they are confronted by very powerful internal disturbances and crises, as is well known. The number of former Roman Catholics who have converted to Orthodoxy also disturbs them. But Orthodoxy has no reason to hasten towards dialogue since the papists remain so obdurate and immovable as regards infallibility, uniatism, and the rest of their pernicious teachings.

During the 2013\u201314 season, Brad Jones did not make any appearance for Liverpool in the [[Premier League]].
