{"title_page": "NRL finals system", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=March 2012}}\nThe '''[[National Rugby League|NRL]] finals system''' is the finals series that is currently being used by the [[National Rugby League|National Rugby League competitions of Australia and New Zealand]] since 2012. The NRL finals system replaced the [[McIntyre System]] which was used from 1999 to 2011.<ref>[http://www.nrl.com/nrl-finals-system-changed/tabid/10874/newsid/65960/default.aspx NRL finals system changed], NRL.com official website, 22 February 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/nrl-quits-mcintyre-system-adopts-afl-style-finals/story-fn2mcuj6-1226278382721 NRL quits McIntyre system, adopts AFL-style finals], ''Fox Sports Australia'', 22 February 2012</ref>\n\nA similar system was previously used by the [[Australian Rugby League]] in the 1995 and 1996 seasons, however there was no crossover in 1995, and in 1996 teams crossed over in Week 2, rather than Week 3. The system has also been adopted by the [[Victorian Football League]] and a slightly modified version adopted by [[Super League]]. The [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) also use this system and have done so since 2000.\n\nThe highest-ranked eight teams at the end of the regular season participate in a four-week tournament, with two teams eliminated in each of the first three weeks. The seventh team is eliminated (and the premiership awarded) in the grand final.\n\nThe system is designed to give the top four teams an easier road to the grand final than the second four teams. The top four needs to win only two finals to reach the grand final, while the second four needs to win three; and, two of the top four teams receive a bye in the second week of the playoff and then play at home in the third week, while the other two play at home in the second week.\n\n==Summary==\n<center>\n{{AFL finals system\n|team-width=150\n|score-width=100\n|QF1-details=1st qualifying final\n|QF1-team1=1st\n|QF1-score1=Home\n|QF1-team2=4th\n|QF1-score2=Away\n|QF2-details=2nd qualifying final\n|QF2-team1=2nd\n|QF2-score1=Home\n|QF2-team2=3rd\n|QF2-score2=Away\n\n|EF1-details=1st elimination final\n|EF1-team1=5th\n|EF1-score1=Home\n|EF1-team2=8th\n|EF1-score2=Away\n|EF2-details=2nd elimination final\n|EF2-team1=6th\n|EF2-score1=Home\n|EF2-team2=7th\n|EF2-score2=Away\n\n|SF1-details= 1st semi-final\n|SF1-team1=Loser of QF1\n|SF1-score1=Home\n|SF1-team2=Winner of EF1\n|SF1-score2=Away\n|SF2-details= 2nd semi-final\n|SF2-team1=Winner of EF2\n|SF2-score1=Away\n|SF2-team2=Loser of QF2\n|SF2-score2=Home\n\n|PF1-details=1st preliminary final\n|PF1-team1=Winner of QF1\n|PF1-score1=\n|PF1-team2=Winner of SF1\n|PF1-score2=\n|PF2-details=2nd preliminary final\n|PF2-team1=Winner of SF2\n|PF2-score1=\n|PF2-team2=Winner of QF2\n|PF2-score2= \n\n|GF-details = [[NRL Grand Final]] - [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|GF-team1   =Winner of PF1\n|GF-score1  =\n|GF-team2   =Winner of PF2\n|GF-score2  = \n}}\n</center>\n\n==Finals format==\n\n===Week one===\n* 1st qualifying final: 1st ranked team hosts 4th ranked team\n* 2nd qualifying final: 2nd ranked team hosts 3rd ranked team\n* 1st elimination final: 5th ranked team hosts 8th ranked team\n* 2nd elimination final: 6th ranked team hosts 7th ranked team\n\nThe eight finalists are split into two groups for the opening week of the finals series.  The top four teams have the best chance of winning the premiership and play the two qualifying finals.

Each group of two earns one extra benefit over the teams beneath it. These benefits are home ground finals and the ''double-chance'', whereby a first-week loss will not eliminate the team from the finals. Note that the \"home\" designations may be irrelevant for games played between teams from the same state - all finals games played between two Sydney based teams will be held at Allianz Stadium or ANZ Stadium, regardless of the \"home\" team's home ground.\n\n===First and second===\nFirst and second receive the double-chance, and will play their first two finals matches at home: their qualifying final, and then either a semi-final if they lose their qualifying final or a preliminary final if they win their qualifying final. They need to win two finals to reach the grand final.\n\n===Third and fourth===\nThird and fourth also receive the double-chance, but receive only one finals match at home: either a semi-final if they lose their qualifying final or a preliminary final if they win their qualifying final. They need to win two finals to reach the grand final.\n\n===Fifth and sixth===\nFifth and sixth receive one home final: their elimination final. They need to win three finals to reach the grand final.\n\n===Seventh and eighth===\nSeventh and eighth receive no home finals. They need to win three finals to reach the grand final.\n\n==Drawn games==\nDrawn games can not occur in the NRL finals system. In the event of tied scores at the end of the 80 minutes of a rugby league match, extra time with [[golden point]] will take place.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe new finals system was introduced after the 2011 season, after debate had raged for several years before that. In 2008 for the first time ever the 8th placed team (New Zealand Warriors) beat the 1st placed team (Melbourne Storm) in week one of the finals. In 2009, the scenario occurred for the 2nd time ever when the Parramatta Eels defeated the St. George Illawarra Dragons.  In both case, these teams then went on to have home advantage in the second week of the finals, leading to criticism from fans and pundits that too much of an advantage was being given to lower placed teams. However, under the current system the 7th and 8th placed teams can never have a home finals match - a move which seems designed to eliminate the possibility of a team making a late charge towards the grand final despite finishing relatively low in the regular season. This has led to criticism that the current system has rendered having a top 8 pointless because some of the teams are there simply to make up numbers as it has been made far too difficult for them to progress very far into the finals series.<ref>http://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/nrl-chief-david-gallop-says-the-mcintyre-finals-system-will-remain/story-fn2mcuj6-1225780895274?nk=9666cbe41d24fa3a32c585e600b754ba</ref> Despite this, in 2017, the eight-placed [[North Queensland Cowboys]] were able to reach the grand final, where they were defeated by the minor premiers, the [[Melbourne Storm]].\n\nIt has also been noted that criticism of the previous McIntyre System has come primarily from coaches and players after their team has been eliminated from the finals by a lower ranked team.

The system has also been adopted by the [[Victorian Football League]] and a slightly modified version adopted by [[Super League]]. The [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) also use this system and have done so since 2000.\n\nThe highest-ranked eight teams at the end of the regular season participate in a four-week tournament, with two teams eliminated in each of the first three weeks. The seventh team is eliminated (and the premiership awarded) in the grand final.\n\nThe system is designed to give the top four teams an easier road to the grand final than the second four teams. The top four needs to win only two finals to reach the grand final, while the second four needs to win three; and, two of the top four teams receive a bye in the second week of the playoff and then play at home in the third week, while the other two play at home in the second week.\n\n==Summary==\n<center>\n{{AFL finals system\n|team-width=150\n|score-width=100\n|QF1-details=1st qualifying final\n|QF1-team1=1st\n|QF1-score1=Home\n|QF1-team2=4th\n|QF1-score2=Away\n|QF2-details=2nd qualifying final\n|QF2-team1=2nd\n|QF2-score1=Home\n|QF2-team2=3rd\n|QF2-score2=Away\n\n|EF1-details=1st elimination final\n|EF1-team1=5th\n|EF1-score1=Home\n|EF1-team2=8th\n|EF1-score2=Away\n|EF2-details=2nd elimination final\n|EF2-team1=6th\n|EF2-score1=Home\n|EF2-team2=7th\n|EF2-score2=Away\n\n|SF1-details= 1st semi-final\n|SF1-team1=Loser of QF1\n|SF1-score1=Home\n|SF1-team2=Winner of EF1\n|SF1-score2=Away\n|SF2-details= 2nd semi-final\n|SF2-team1=Winner of EF2\n|SF2-score1=Away\n|SF2-team2=Loser of QF2\n|SF2-score2=Home\n\n|PF1-details=1st preliminary final\n|PF1-team1=Winner of QF1\n|PF1-score1=\n|PF1-team2=Winner of SF1\n|PF1-score2=\n|PF2-details=2nd preliminary final\n|PF2-team1=Winner of SF2\n|PF2-score1=\n|PF2-team2=Winner of QF2\n|PF2-score2= \n\n|GF-details = [[NRL Grand Final]] - [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|GF-team1   =Winner of PF1\n|GF-score1  =\n|GF-team2   =Winner of PF2\n|GF-score2  = \n}}\n</center>\n\n==Finals format==\n\n===Week one===\n* 1st qualifying final: 1st ranked team hosts 4th ranked team\n* 2nd qualifying final: 2nd ranked team hosts 3rd ranked team\n* 1st elimination final: 5th ranked team hosts 8th ranked team\n* 2nd elimination final: 6th ranked team hosts 7th ranked team\n\nThe eight finalists are split into two groups for the opening week of the finals series.

Retrieved April 1, 2013.</ref>\n| gross          = $300 million<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n}}\n\n'''''Smokey and the Bandit''''' is a 1977 American [[Road movie|road]] [[action film|action comedy film]] starring [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Sally Field]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Mike Henry (football)|Mike Henry]]. The film was the directorial debut of [[stuntman]] [[Hal Needham]].\n\nThe film follows Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Reed), two [[Rum-running|bootleggers]], as they attempt to drive from [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] to [[Texarkana]], pick up 400 cases of [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors beer]], and illegally transport it back to Atlanta in 28 hours or less. While Snow drives the truck carrying the beer, the Bandit drives a [[Pontiac Trans Am]] to distract law enforcement and keep the attention off Snow.  During their run, they are relentlessly pursued by Buford T. Justice (Gleason), a blusterous Texas county sheriff.\n\n''Smokey and the Bandit'' was followed by two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' (1983). ''Smokey and the Bandit'' was the [[1977 in film|second highest-grossing domestic film of 1977]], second only to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the first film in the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette and his son Little Enos seek a trucker willing to [[Rum-running|bootleg]] [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for their refreshment; Big Enos has sponsored a racer in Atlanta's Southern Classic and wants to celebrate in style when he wins.  They find local legend Bo \"Bandit\" Darville at a [[roadeo]] at [[Lakewood Fairgrounds]] in [[Atlanta]] and offer him $80,000 to pick up 400 cases of Coors from [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]] (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time), and bring it back to Atlanta in 28 hours. Bandit takes the bet and recruits his partner Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black [[Pontiac Trans Am]] bought on an advance from the Burdettes as a \"blocker\" to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo.\n\nThey arrive in Texarkana an hour ahead of schedule, load the truck and head back toward Atlanta. Immediately upon starting the second leg of the run, Bandit is stopped by a runaway bride named Carrie who hitches a ride, but in so doing Bandit becomes a target of Sheriff [[Buford T. Justice]], a career Texas lawman whose son Junior was to have been Carrie's bridegroom. Ignoring his own jurisdiction, Sheriff Justice, with dimwitted Junior in tow, pursues Bandit all the way to Georgia to get Carrie back. As they chase Bandit, various mishaps cause their cruiser to disintegrate around them.\n\nBandit's antics attract more attention from police throughout [[Dixie]] while Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped along the way by many colorful characters via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]].  Neither Sheriff Justice nor any other officials know of Snowman's illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Sheriff Justice is pursuing him because of Carrie.  Moments after crossing back into Georgia, Snowman is narrowly rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a motorcycle patrolman, and the chase intensifies when state and local police escalate their pursuit of Bandit with more cruisers, roadblocks, and even a police helicopter to track his movements.\n\nDiscouraged by the unexpected mounting attention, and with just four miles to go, Bandit is about to give up, but Snowman refuses to listen and takes the lead, smashing through the police roadblock at the fairgrounds' main entrance.  They make it back during the race with only ten minutes left, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a 'double-or-nothing' offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to [[Boston]] and bring back [[clam chowder]] in 18 hours. They quickly escape in one of Big Enos' thirteen [[Cadillac Eldorado|Cadillacs]] as the police flood the racetrack.  They pass Sheriff Justice's badly damaged police car by the side of the road. Over the radio, Bandit first directs Justice to Big and Little Enos, but then, out of respect, reveals his true location and invites Justice to give chase, leaving Junior behind with his car falling apart even more as the end credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Bo Darville (\"Bandit\")\n* [[Sally Field]] as Carrie (\"Frog\")\n* [[Jerry Reed]] as Cledus Snow (\"Snowman\")\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as [[Buford T.

It was not until Needham's friend Burt Reynolds read the script, and said he would star, that the film was aimed at a more mainstream release; Reed would now portray Bandit's friend Snowman (Reed would eventually play the Bandit in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]''). At that time Reynolds was the top box office star in the world. In the original script Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. Bandit's car was a second generation [[Ford Mustang]] and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\">{{cite web | url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/80484/13-fast-facts-about-smokey-and-bandit | title=13 Fast Facts About ''Smokey and the Bandit'' | first=Roger | last=Cormier | date=May 27, 2017 | website=mentalfloss.com | accessdate=December 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBurt Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads. Upon showing it to his friend, Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read but that he would still make the movie. Most of the dialogue was improvised on set.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\"/>\n\n[[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] bankrolled ''Smokey and the Bandit'' for $5.3 million, figuring it was a good risk.<ref name=\"CNN\"/> Just two days before production was to begin, Universal sent a \"hatchet man\" to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $1 million. With Reynolds' salary at $1 million, Needham was left with only $3.3 million to make the film. Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule.<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n\n\"Buford T. Justice\" was the name of a real [[Florida Highway Patrol]]man known to Reynolds' father, who was once Police Chief of [[Riviera Beach, Florida]]. His father was also the inspiration for the word \"sumbitch\" used in the film, a variation of the phrase \"son-of-a-bitch\" that, according to Reynolds, he uttered quite often.\n\nJackie Gleason was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout.  In particular, the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in the \"choke and puke\" (a roadside diner) was not in the original story, but rather was Gleason's idea.\n\nBefore Gleason was cast in the film, [[Richard Boone]] was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\"/>\n\nSally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Reynolds actively pushed for her casting after Universal initially resisted, claiming Field was not attractive enough. Field enjoyed making the film, but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised.\n\nReportedly, Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, as in the film industry, he was better known as a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]]. He managed to obtain studio attention after his friend Reynolds agreed to portray the Bandit in the film.\n\nThe movie was primarily filmed in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the cities of [[McDonough, Georgia|McDonough]], [[Jonesboro, Georgia|Jonesboro]] and [[Lithonia, Georgia|Lithonia]]. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area, and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between [[Fayetteville, Georgia|Fayetteville]] and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy's Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, [[Georgia State Route 400]], I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit), and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gas station was filmed in [[Ojai, California]] on the corner of Ojai Avenue and El Paseo Road. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at [[Lakewood Speedway]] at the old [[Lakewood Fairgrounds]] on the south side of Atlanta. The [[roller coaster]] seen in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' and a flashback scene in ''Part 3''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greyhound - Lakewood Park (Atlanta, Georgia, USA)|url=http://rcdb.com/1965.htm|publisher=Roller Coaster DataBase|access-date=March 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film's theme song, \"[[East Bound and Down]]\", was written virtually overnight by Jerry Reed. He gave Needham a preview of the song, and when initially he got no reaction from the director, offered to rewrite the song. Needham, however, liked the song so much he assured Jerry not to change a word.

Three actors from the main cast of ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' appear in small uncredited roles in ''Smokey and the Bandit'': [[Ben Jones (American actor and politician)|Ben Jones]], [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Sonny Shroyer]] (who played a police officer in both). In return, Reynolds portrayed the ''Dukes'' character [[Boss Hogg]] (originally portrayed by [[Sorrell Booke]]) in the film adaptation ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (2005). Reynolds is also referenced by name in several early episodes of the series.\n\n===Vehicles===\nNeedham saw an advertisement for the soon-to-be-released 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that would be the Bandit's car, or, as Needham referred to it, a character in the movie. He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two [[Pontiac LeMans]] 4-door sedans would be provided for the movie.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pontiacsonline.com/JIM%20WANGERS.htm | title=An Interview With Jim Wangers: Pontiac and the 1970's | first=John | last=Chung | website=PontiacsOnline.com | accessdate=December 27, 2018}}</ref> The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends. (From 1970 to 1976, both the Firebird/Trans Am and [[Chevrolet Camaro]] had two round headlights, and in 1977, the Firebird/Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights, while the Camaro remained unchanged.) The decals were also changed to 1977-style units, as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches, as had been the case in 1976. The hood scoop on these cars says \"6.6 LITRE\", which in 1977 would have denoted an [[Oldsmobile]] 403-equipped car or a non W-72, 180&nbsp;hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine.

The Trans Am used for the dismantled bridge jump was equipped with a booster rocket, the same type that was used by [[Evel Knievel]] during his failed [[Snake River Canyon (Idaho)|Snake River Canyon]] jump. Needham served as the driver for the stunt (standing in for Reynolds) while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car (standing in for Sally Field during the jump). By the movie's ending, the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running.  Notably, this gives rise to various continuity errors with Justice's patrol car, which during some chase sequences is shown with a black rear fender which then reverts to the car's bronze color again in later scenes.  When it is finally torn off along with the car's roof in the impact with the girder, the missing fender still reappears later on in the film.   The Burdettes' car is a 1974 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] convertible painted in \"Candy Red\" color scheme, and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie,  and in the final scene as Bandit, Snowman, Fred, and Frog use it to make their escape.\n\nThe film also made use of three [[Kenworth W900]]A short-frame semi trucks, which Jerry Reed can be seen driving, each equipped with 38-inch sleepers. Two units were 1974 models as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille, and one unit was a 1973 model as evidenced by the gold-painted Kenworth emblem on the truck's grille signifying Kenworth's 50 years in business. The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims, and the {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non-operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit. This is obvious, because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit, and the unit is never heard running.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hankstruckpictures.com/forum01/index.php?topic%3D1459.0 |title=BIZARRE QUESTION|access-date=September 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016064743/http://hankstruckpictures.com/forum01/index.php?topic=1459.0 |archive-date=October 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Legal status of Coors beer===\nIn 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of [[Oklahoma]].

[[Carl Yastrzemski]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] would bring several cases back with him on the team plane, after playing opposing teams on the west coast, by stashing it in the team's equipment trunks.

For this purpose, they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive, which was (and remains, to an extent) common practice. The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford's often-spoken phrase \"sumbitch\" (a contraction of \"son of a bitch\"; usually in reference to the Bandit) with the phrase \"scum bum\". This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children, and the 2007 ''[[Hot Wheels]]'' release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has \"scum bum\" emblazoned on its tail. The TV prints of the first two ''Bandit'' films are still shown regularly on television, although a few TV stations aired the unedited version in recent years as some of the phraseology (i.e. \"(son of a) bitch\", \"ass\", etc.) became more acceptable on TV.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe original actors mostly redubbed their own lines for the television version, except for Gleason. Actor [[Henry Corden]], who voiced [[Fred Flintstone]] after original performer [[Alan Reed]] died, was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice's dialogue.\n\nIn the UK, the heavily dubbed version was shown for a number of years, particularly by the [[BBC]]. However, in more recent years, the original version has been shown (on [[ITV Network|ITV]], a commercial channel), usually with the stronger language edited out, often quite awkwardly and noticeably.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe theatrical release itself had a few lines deleted, including an edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to \"[[fuck]] off.\" His expletive is obscured when a passing [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]] sounds its horn. At the time, using the 'F' word would immediately require an [[Motion picture rating system|R rating]] and this self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience. However, the scene and the obscured expletive were played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors.\n\nIn 2006, a DVD re-release was issued of ''Smokey and the Bandit'' featuring a digitally remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby-compatible surround sound. Many of the film's original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run-up sequence in the opening sequence of the film was completely dubbed over with a totally new sound. A few other examples of \"sound effect replacement\" occur when Bandit takes off after getting a reluctant Cledus involved in the bet, Bandit coming to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie, and when Buford\u2019s car top comes off. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cledus' dog Fred's barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced. (Note: earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/item/smokey-and-the-bandit-40th-brd|title=Smokey and the Bandit: 40th Anniversary Edition|last=Salmons|first=Tim|date=May 29, 2017|work=The Digital Bits|access-date=November 12, 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nMajor portions of the audio 'background' have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film.

Retrieved April 1, 2013.</ref>\n| gross          = $300 million<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n}}\n\n'''''Smokey and the Bandit''''' is a 1977 American [[Road movie|road]] [[action film|action comedy film]] starring [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Sally Field]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Mike Henry (football)|Mike Henry]]. The film was the directorial debut of [[stuntman]] [[Hal Needham]].\n\nThe film follows Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Reed), two [[Rum-running|bootleggers]], as they attempt to drive from [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] to [[Texarkana]], pick up 400 cases of [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors beer]], and illegally transport it back to Atlanta in 28 hours or less. While Snow drives the truck carrying the beer, the Bandit drives a [[Pontiac Trans Am]] to distract law enforcement and keep the attention off Snow.  During their run, they are relentlessly pursued by Buford T. Justice (Gleason), a blusterous Texas county sheriff.\n\n''Smokey and the Bandit'' was followed by two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' (1983). ''Smokey and the Bandit'' was the [[1977 in film|second highest-grossing domestic film of 1977]], second only to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the first film in the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette and his son Little Enos seek a trucker willing to [[Rum-running|bootleg]] [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for their refreshment; Big Enos has sponsored a racer in Atlanta's Southern Classic and wants to celebrate in style when he wins.  They find local legend Bo \"Bandit\" Darville at a [[roadeo]] at [[Lakewood Fairgrounds]] in [[Atlanta]] and offer him $80,000 to pick up 400 cases of Coors from [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]] (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time), and bring it back to Atlanta in 28 hours. Bandit takes the bet and recruits his partner Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black [[Pontiac Trans Am]] bought on an advance from the Burdettes as a \"blocker\" to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo.\n\nThey arrive in Texarkana an hour ahead of schedule, load the truck and head back toward Atlanta. Immediately upon starting the second leg of the run, Bandit is stopped by a runaway bride named Carrie who hitches a ride, but in so doing Bandit becomes a target of Sheriff [[Buford T. Justice]], a career Texas lawman whose son Junior was to have been Carrie's bridegroom. Ignoring his own jurisdiction, Sheriff Justice, with dimwitted Junior in tow, pursues Bandit all the way to Georgia to get Carrie back. As they chase Bandit, various mishaps cause their cruiser to disintegrate around them.\n\nBandit's antics attract more attention from police throughout [[Dixie]] while Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped along the way by many colorful characters via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]].  Neither Sheriff Justice nor any other officials know of Snowman's illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Sheriff Justice is pursuing him because of Carrie.  Moments after crossing back into Georgia, Snowman is narrowly rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a motorcycle patrolman, and the chase intensifies when state and local police escalate their pursuit of Bandit with more cruisers, roadblocks, and even a police helicopter to track his movements.\n\nDiscouraged by the unexpected mounting attention, and with just four miles to go, Bandit is about to give up, but Snowman refuses to listen and takes the lead, smashing through the police roadblock at the fairgrounds' main entrance.  They make it back during the race with only ten minutes left, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a 'double-or-nothing' offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to [[Boston]] and bring back [[clam chowder]] in 18 hours. They quickly escape in one of Big Enos' thirteen [[Cadillac Eldorado|Cadillacs]] as the police flood the racetrack.  They pass Sheriff Justice's badly damaged police car by the side of the road. Over the radio, Bandit first directs Justice to Big and Little Enos, but then, out of respect, reveals his true location and invites Justice to give chase, leaving Junior behind with his car falling apart even more as the end credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Bo Darville (\"Bandit\")\n* [[Sally Field]] as Carrie (\"Frog\")\n* [[Jerry Reed]] as Cledus Snow (\"Snowman\")\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as [[Buford T.

It was not until Needham's friend Burt Reynolds read the script, and said he would star, that the film was aimed at a more mainstream release; Reed would now portray Bandit's friend Snowman (Reed would eventually play the Bandit in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]''). At that time Reynolds was the top box office star in the world. In the original script Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. Bandit's car was a second generation [[Ford Mustang]] and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\">{{cite web | url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/80484/13-fast-facts-about-smokey-and-bandit | title=13 Fast Facts About ''Smokey and the Bandit'' | first=Roger | last=Cormier | date=May 27, 2017 | website=mentalfloss.com | accessdate=December 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBurt Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads. Upon showing it to his friend, Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read but that he would still make the movie. Most of the dialogue was improvised on set.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\"/>\n\n[[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] bankrolled ''Smokey and the Bandit'' for $5.3 million, figuring it was a good risk.<ref name=\"CNN\"/> Just two days before production was to begin, Universal sent a \"hatchet man\" to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $1 million. With Reynolds' salary at $1 million, Needham was left with only $3.3 million to make the film. Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule.<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n\n\"Buford T. Justice\" was the name of a real [[Florida Highway Patrol]]man known to Reynolds' father, who was once Police Chief of [[Riviera Beach, Florida]]. His father was also the inspiration for the word \"sumbitch\" used in the film, a variation of the phrase \"son-of-a-bitch\" that, according to Reynolds, he uttered quite often.\n\nJackie Gleason was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout.  In particular, the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in the \"choke and puke\" (a roadside diner) was not in the original story, but rather was Gleason's idea.\n\nBefore Gleason was cast in the film, [[Richard Boone]] was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\"/>\n\nSally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Reynolds actively pushed for her casting after Universal initially resisted, claiming Field was not attractive enough. Field enjoyed making the film, but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised.\n\nReportedly, Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, as in the film industry, he was better known as a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]]. He managed to obtain studio attention after his friend Reynolds agreed to portray the Bandit in the film.\n\nThe movie was primarily filmed in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the cities of [[McDonough, Georgia|McDonough]], [[Jonesboro, Georgia|Jonesboro]] and [[Lithonia, Georgia|Lithonia]]. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area, and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between [[Fayetteville, Georgia|Fayetteville]] and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy's Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, [[Georgia State Route 400]], I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit), and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gas station was filmed in [[Ojai, California]] on the corner of Ojai Avenue and El Paseo Road. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at [[Lakewood Speedway]] at the old [[Lakewood Fairgrounds]] on the south side of Atlanta. The [[roller coaster]] seen in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' and a flashback scene in ''Part 3''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greyhound - Lakewood Park (Atlanta, Georgia, USA)|url=http://rcdb.com/1965.htm|publisher=Roller Coaster DataBase|access-date=March 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film's theme song, \"[[East Bound and Down]]\", was written virtually overnight by Jerry Reed. He gave Needham a preview of the song, and when initially he got no reaction from the director, offered to rewrite the song. Needham, however, liked the song so much he assured Jerry not to change a word. It became one of Reed's biggest hits and his signature song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2012/06/07/smokey-and-the-bandit-at-35-a-case-for-the-genius-of-hal-needham/%7C/|title=Page not found - Movieline}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe area around [[Helen, Georgia]], was also used for some locations. The scene where Buford T. Justice's car has the door knocked off by a passing semi truck was shot on Georgia State Route 75, {{convert|3|miles|km}} north of Helen. The tow truck driver was a local garage owner, Berlin Wike.\n\nThe film features the custom clothing and costuming of Niver Western Wear of [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref>Niver Western Wear Corporate Records</ref> Niver provided much of the western attire worn in the film, as well as the custom-made sheriff's uniforms (waist size 64 inches) that Jackie Gleason wore throughout the film.\n\nReynolds and Sally Field began dating during the filming.<ref>https://worldgarages.com/news/Burt-Reynolds-old-Pontiac-Trans-Am-replica-sold-for-317500</ref>\n\nWhile made to take advantage of the ongoing 1970s [[Citizens band radio#1970s popularity|CB radio fad]], the film added to the craze.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=jUR-BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT405&dq=cb+radio+craze+smokey+and+the+bandit#v=onepage&q=cb%20radio%20craze%20smokey%20and%20the%20bandit&f=false. | title=Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology | page=377 | first1=Joseph | last1=Straubhaar | first2=Robert | last2=LaRose | first3=Lucinda | last3=Davenport | year=2016 | edition=9th | publisher=Cengage Learning | location=Boston | isbn=978-1-305-08035-5 | access-date=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThough the film ''[[Moonrunners]]'' (1975) is the precursor to the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (1979\u20131985), from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts, the popularity of ''Smokey and the Bandit'' and similar films helped get the ''Dukes'' series on the air. Three actors from the main cast of ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' appear in small uncredited roles in ''Smokey and the Bandit'': [[Ben Jones (American actor and politician)|Ben Jones]], [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Sonny Shroyer]] (who played a police officer in both). In return, Reynolds portrayed the ''Dukes'' character [[Boss Hogg]] (originally portrayed by [[Sorrell Booke]]) in the film adaptation ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (2005). Reynolds is also referenced by name in several early episodes of the series.\n\n===Vehicles===\nNeedham saw an advertisement for the soon-to-be-released 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that would be the Bandit's car, or, as Needham referred to it, a character in the movie. He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two [[Pontiac LeMans]] 4-door sedans would be provided for the movie.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pontiacsonline.com/JIM%20WANGERS.htm | title=An Interview With Jim Wangers: Pontiac and the 1970's | first=John | last=Chung | website=PontiacsOnline.com | accessdate=December 27, 2018}}</ref> The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends. (From 1970 to 1976, both the Firebird/Trans Am and [[Chevrolet Camaro]] had two round headlights, and in 1977, the Firebird/Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights, while the Camaro remained unchanged.) The decals were also changed to 1977-style units, as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches, as had been the case in 1976. The hood scoop on these cars says \"6.6 LITRE\", which in 1977 would have denoted an [[Oldsmobile]] 403-equipped car or a non W-72, 180&nbsp;hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine. All four of the cars were badly damaged during production,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fortune.com/2011/02/09/how-smokey-and-the-bandit-was-born/ | title=How ''Smokey and the Bandit'' was born | first1=Scott | last1=Olster | first2=Hal | last2=Needham | work=Fortune | date=February 9, 2011 | accessdate=December 27, 2018}}</ref> one of which was all but destroyed during the jump over the dismantled bridge. The Trans Am used for the dismantled bridge jump was equipped with a booster rocket, the same type that was used by [[Evel Knievel]] during his failed [[Snake River Canyon (Idaho)|Snake River Canyon]] jump. Needham served as the driver for the stunt (standing in for Reynolds) while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car (standing in for Sally Field during the jump). By the movie's ending, the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running.  Notably, this gives rise to various continuity errors with Justice's patrol car, which during some chase sequences is shown with a black rear fender which then reverts to the car's bronze color again in later scenes.  When it is finally torn off along with the car's roof in the impact with the girder, the missing fender still reappears later on in the film.   The Burdettes' car is a 1974 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] convertible painted in \"Candy Red\" color scheme, and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie,  and in the final scene as Bandit, Snowman, Fred, and Frog use it to make their escape.\n\nThe film also made use of three [[Kenworth W900]]A short-frame semi trucks, which Jerry Reed can be seen driving, each equipped with 38-inch sleepers. Two units were 1974 models as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille, and one unit was a 1973 model as evidenced by the gold-painted Kenworth emblem on the truck's grille signifying Kenworth's 50 years in business. The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims, and the {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non-operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit. This is obvious, because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit, and the unit is never heard running.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hankstruckpictures.com/forum01/index.php?topic%3D1459.0 |title=BIZARRE QUESTION|access-date=September 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016064743/http://hankstruckpictures.com/forum01/index.php?topic=1459.0 |archive-date=October 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Legal status of Coors beer===\nIn 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of [[Oklahoma]]. A 1974 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article explains why Coors was so coveted that one would be willing to pay the Bandit such a high price to transport it. Coors Banquet Beer had a brief renaissance as certain people sought it out for its lack of stabilizers and preservatives. The article says that future Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] hid it in his luggage after a trip to [[Colorado]] in order to take it back to Washington. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had a steady supply airlifted to Washington by the Air Force. [[Carl Yastrzemski]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] would bring several cases back with him on the team plane, after playing opposing teams on the west coast, by stashing it in the team's equipment trunks. The article also mentions Frederick Amon, who smuggled it from Colorado to [[North Carolina]] and sold it for four times the retail price.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=BREWING: The Beer That Won the West | magazine=Time | date=February 11, 1974 | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908509,00.html | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The lack of additives and preservatives meant that Coors had the potential for spoiling in a week if it were not kept cold throughout its transportation and in storage at its destination.

It became Reed's signature song and is found on multiple albums, including ''Country Legends'' and his live album ''Jerry Reed: Live Still''. In 1991 it was arranged for orchestra by Crafton Beck and recorded by [[Erich Kunzel]] and the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]] for their album ''Down on the Farm''. Several other groups, such as US rock band [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]], and UK based country covers band [https://www.facebook.com/We-Be-Ploughin-180247576100096 We Be Ploughin'] have also covered it. Reed also penned and performed the song for the opening credits, entitled \"The Legend\", which tells of some of The Bandit's escapades prior to the events of the film, and the ballad \"The Bandit\", which features in several versions in the movie and on the soundtrack. Reed's hit notwithstanding, [[Bill Justis]] is the first name on the credits for the soundtrack as he composed and arranged original music throughout the film.

He also claimed that Bandit is never made aware of Frog's leaving Junior at the altar, which is why the Bandit continually asks why a Texas sheriff is chasing him. However, this is inaccurate: within seconds of Bandit picking her up, Frog tells him \"there is a wedding in search of a bride\", and goes on to explain her ill-advised romance with Junior, as Bandit holds up the CB mic for Snowman to hear.\n\nThe film's editors, Walter Hannemann and Angelo Ross, were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]].

Because of the popularity of the movie and the sales success of the Trans Am, then President of Pontiac Alex Mair promised to supply Reynolds with a Trans Am each year. Owing to his financial difficulties, in 2014 Reynolds put his vast collection of artwork and memorabilia up for auction, including the Trans Am. High estimates for the car were up to $80,000, but that was dwarfed by the actual sale price of $450,000. Also up for auction was a [[go-kart]] replica of the car, which sold for nearly $14,000.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Nunez|first1=Alex|title=Burt Reynolds' Bandit Trans Am sells for $450,000|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/news/a24515/burt-reynolds-bandit-trans-am-sells-for-450000/|magazine=[[Road & Track]]|accessdate=August 10, 2015|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref> In 2016, Trans Am Depot, a Florida-based automobile customization company, announced that it would build 77 Trans Ams that would be modeled after the car that Reynolds drove in the 1977 original.

These new models were built off the Camaro platform (the very same one that the real Firebird and Trans Am used), came with Pontiac arrowhead, flaming bird and Bandit logos, as well as instrument panels, center consoles and hood scoops emulating their 1977 counterparts, and were signed by Reynolds. Some differences included the use of a supercharged 454-cid (7.4-liter) Chevrolet-sourced engine that put out 840 HP, and four round headlights, which appeared on the 1967-69 Firebirds/Trans Ams only; the actual 1977-81 models had rectangular headlights.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hlavaty|first1=Craig|title=See a \"New\" Vintage Bandit Trans Am Approved by Burt Reynolds Himself|url=https://www.chron.com/cars/news/article/See-a-new-vintage-Bandit-Trans-Am-approved-by-7217360.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Diablo sandwich===\n\nThe diablo sandwich ordered by Sheriff Justice in the [[Arkansas]] [[barbecue restaurant]] scene has entered popular culture as a minor reference to the film. While no authoritative source identifies the composition of the sandwich, there are several possibilities. A segment of the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] program ''[[Reel Eats]]'' used a [[sloppy joe]]-style recipe consisting of seasoned [[ground beef]], [[corn kernel|corn]] and [[sour cream]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oaklandcountymoms.com/diablo-sandwich-recipe-cmts-reel-eats-33963/ |title=Diablo Sandwich Recipe from CMT's Reel Eats |first=Lisa |last=LaGrou |date=February 9, 2014 |publisher=Oakland County Moms}}</ref> Another proposal, based more closely on images from the film and the shooting location of the scene (at an [[Old Hickory House]] restaurant in Georgia), is [[pulled pork]] and [[hot sauce]] on a [[hamburger|hamburger bun]]. Other sources in East Texas (from whence Sheriff Justice hails) are familiar with the popular regional delicacy known as the Diablo Sandwich. It consists of any of the various [[Louisiana]]-style hot sauces on [[Texas Toast]]-style bread alongside the fourth most famous product of [[Pittsburg, Texas]] (behind [[Pilgrim's Pride]], [[Cavender's]] and [[Carroll Shelby]]) \u2013 [[Pittsburg Hot Links]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadfood.com/Forums/Diablo-Sandwich-quotDiablo-amp-Docquot-From-Smokey-amp-the-Bandit-Identified-m778897.aspx |title=Diablo Sandwich / \"Diablo & Doc\" From Smokey & the Bandit, Identified! |publisher=[[Roadfood.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===The Bandit Run===\n\nFirst run in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie, [[The Bandit Run]] was the brainchild of Dave Hall, owner of Restore A Muscle Car. A group of Trans Am owners and fans of the movie take part in an annual road trip from [[Texarkana]] to [[Jonesboro, Georgia]], recreating the route taken by the characters in the film.\n\nThe Bandit Run quickly caught on and has become a fixture, in 2017 celebrating the 40th anniversary of the movie with a special screening of the film attended by Burt Reynolds and a recreation of the jump undertaken by Bandit and Frog across a river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebanditrun.com/|title=The Bandit Run - Brought to you by Restore A Muscle Car|website=The Bandit Run}}</ref>\n\n===Mobil 1 commercial===\n\nIn 2014, petroleum company [[Mobil 1]] produced television commercials, featuring [[NASCAR]] star [[Tony Stewart]], closely based on the film. Called ''Smoke is the Bandit'' playing on Stewart's nickname, the commercials featured him as the Bandit opposite [[Darrell Waltrip]] who played Snowman and [[Jeff Hammond (NASCAR)|Jeff Hammond]] as Buford T. Justice. The story replaced the Coors beer with Mobil 1 products. The adverts poked fun at the film and even featured a Pontiac Trans Am and a cover version of the song ''East Bound and Down''. The commercials were produced after Stewart mentioned that the movie was one of his favorites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/6/tony-stewart-bandit-commercial-mobil-1-ad.html|title=Stewart plays off 'Smokey and the Bandit in Mobil 1 ad}}</ref>\n\n==Television censorship and alternative versions==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\nWhen ''Smokey and the Bandit'' first aired on American network television in the early 1980s, [[censorship|censors]] were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film. For this purpose, they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive, which was (and remains, to an extent) common practice. The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford's often-spoken phrase \"sumbitch\" (a contraction of \"son of a bitch\"; usually in reference to the Bandit) with the phrase \"scum bum\". This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children, and the 2007 ''[[Hot Wheels]]'' release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has \"scum bum\" emblazoned on its tail. The TV prints of the first two ''Bandit'' films are still shown regularly on television, although a few TV stations aired the unedited version in recent years as some of the phraseology (i.e. \"(son of a) bitch\", \"ass\", etc.) became more acceptable on TV.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe original actors mostly redubbed their own lines for the television version, except for Gleason. Actor [[Henry Corden]], who voiced [[Fred Flintstone]] after original performer [[Alan Reed]] died, was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice's dialogue.\n\nIn the UK, the heavily dubbed version was shown for a number of years, particularly by the [[BBC]]. However, in more recent years, the original version has been shown (on [[ITV Network|ITV]], a commercial channel), usually with the stronger language edited out, often quite awkwardly and noticeably.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe theatrical release itself had a few lines deleted, including an edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to \"[[fuck]] off.\" His expletive is obscured when a passing [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]] sounds its horn. At the time, using the 'F' word would immediately require an [[Motion picture rating system|R rating]] and this self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience. However, the scene and the obscured expletive were played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors.\n\nIn 2006, a DVD re-release was issued of ''Smokey and the Bandit'' featuring a digitally remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby-compatible surround sound. Many of the film's original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run-up sequence in the opening sequence of the film was completely dubbed over with a totally new sound. A few other examples of \"sound effect replacement\" occur when Bandit takes off after getting a reluctant Cledus involved in the bet, Bandit coming to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie, and when Buford\u2019s car top comes off. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cledus' dog Fred's barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced. (Note: earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/item/smokey-and-the-bandit-40th-brd|title=Smokey and the Bandit: 40th Anniversary Edition|last=Salmons|first=Tim|date=May 29, 2017|work=The Digital Bits|access-date=November 12, 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nMajor portions of the audio 'background' have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film. The updated version of the film features sounds inaccurate for what would be produced by the Trans Am or the numerous other Pontiac vehicles in the film. The original film had correct sounds that were usually recorded live as the action took place.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Television spin-off films==\n{{Main|Bandit (film series)}}\nA series of four [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] films (''Bandit Goes Country'', ''Bandit Bandit'', ''Beauty and the Bandit'' and ''Bandit's Silver Angel'') were produced in 1994 for [[Universal Television]]'s [[Action Pack (television)|Action Pack]] with actor [[Brian Bloom]] playing a younger version of Bandit. The three original films introduced two generations of the [[Pontiac Trans Am]], and the [[Mitsubishi GTO|Dodge Stealth]] in the television movies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Bandit Run]]\n* ''[[The Cannonball Run]]''\n* ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0076729}}\n* {{allrovi movie|45289}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=22661}}\n* {{AFI film|id=55881|title=Smokey and the Bandit}}\n* {{mojo title|smokeyandthebandit|Smokey and the Bandit}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|smokey_and_the_bandit}}\n\n{{Hal Needham}}\n{{Smokey and the Bandit}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smokey And The Bandit}}\n[[Category:Smokey and the Bandit]]\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:1970s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s road movies]]\n[[Category:1970s chase films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Country music films]]\n[[Category:American road movies]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional smugglers]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films about beer]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hal Needham]]\n[[Category:Films set in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Films set in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Films set in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Trucker films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Shyer]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Citizens band radio in popular culture]]\n[[Category:1977 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Pontiac]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTelevision spin-off films", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit"}

There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]].

[[France]] that existed from January 2015 to October 2016. There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]]. The camp was completely cleared and demolished in October 2016. According to Government plans, 6,400 migrants would be moved to 280 temporary reception centres around France.

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|12|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|9|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|5|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/15|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 15|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|12|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|9|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|5|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/15|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 15|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)
