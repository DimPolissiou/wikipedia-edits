Konstantin refused to submit to De\u010danski, who then invaded Zeta, defeating and killing Konstantin.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=264}} De\u010danski was crowned king on 6 January 1322 by Nicodemus, and his son, Stefan Du\u0161an, was crowned \u201cyoung king\u201d.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=263}} De\u010danski later granted Zeta to Du\u0161an, indicating him as the intended heir.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=264}} In the meantime, Vladislav II mobilized local support from [[Rudnik (mountain)|Rudnik]], the former appanage of his father, [[Stefan Dragutin]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=264}} Vladislav proclaimed himself king, and he was supported by the Hungarians, consolidating control over his lands and preparing for battle with De\u010danski.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=264}} As was the case with their fathers, Serbia was divided by the two independent rulers; in 1322 and 1323 Ragusan merchants freely visited both lands.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=264}}\n\nIn 1323, war broke out between De\u010danski and Vladislav. Rudnik had fallen to De\u010danski by the end of 1323, and Vladislav appeared to have fled north.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=264}} Vladislav was defeated in battle in late 1324 and fled to Hungary,{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=265}} leaving the Serbian throne to De\u010danski as undisputed \"king of All Serbian and Maritime lands\".\n\n==Biography==\n===Youth and usurpation===\nDu\u0161an was the eldest son of King [[Stefan De\u010danski]] and [[Theodora Smilets]], the daughter of emperor [[Smilets of Bulgaria]]. He was born circa 1308 in Serbia, but with the exile of his father in 1314, the family lived in [[Constantinople]] until 1320, when his father was allowed to return. In Constantinople he learned [[Greek language|Greek]], gained an understanding of Byzantine life and culture, and became acquainted with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He took a lot interest in arts of war; in his youth he fought exceptionally in two battles: in 1329 he defeated the [[ban (title)|ban]] [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromani\u0107]] during the [[War of Hum (1326\u201329)|War of Hum]], and in 1330 the [[Bulgaria]]n emperor [[Michael III Shishman]] in the [[Battle of Velbazhd|Battle of Velbu\u017ed]]. De\u010danski appointed his nephew [[Ivan Stephen of Bulgaria|Ivan Stephen]] (through [[Anna Neda of Serbia|Anna Neda]]) to the throne of Bulgaria in August 1330.\n\n[[File:Paja Jovanovi\u0107-\u017denidba Cara Du\u0161ana.jpg|thumb|<center>\"Wedding of Emperor Du\u0161an\", by [[Paja Jovanovi\u0107]]</center>]]\n\nDe\u010danski's decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at Velbazhd, when he had an opportunity, resulted in the alienation of many nobles,{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} who sought to expand to the south.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}} By January or February 1331, Du\u0161an was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}} According to contemporary pro-Du\u0161an sources, advisors turned De\u010danski against his son, and he decided to seize and exclude Du\u0161an from his inheritance. De\u010danski sent an army into Zeta against his son; the army ravaged Skadar (modern [[Shkod\u00ebr]]), but Du\u0161an had crossed the [[Bojana (river)|Bojana river]]. A brief period of anarchy took place in parts of Serbia before father and son concluded peace in April 1331.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} Three months later, De\u010danski ordered Du\u0161an to meet him. Du\u0161an feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Du\u0161an marched from Skadar to [[Nerodimlje]], where he besieged his father.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} De\u010danski fled, and Du\u0161an captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at [[Petrich]]. On 21 August 1331 De\u010danski surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Du\u0161an's advisors, he was imprisoned.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} Du\u0161an was crowned ''King of All Serbian and Maritime lands'' in the first week of September.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}}\n\nThe civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Emperor [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] feared Serbia, as the situation there had settled, and he immediately sought peace with Du\u0161an.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}} As Du\u0161an wanted to move against richer Byzantium, the two made peace and an alliance in December 1331. It was sealed with the marriage of Du\u0161an and [[Helena of Bulgaria]], Empress of Serbia, the sister of [[tsar]] Ivan Alexander.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}}\n\n===Personal traits===\nContemporary writers described Du\u0161an as unusually tall and strong, \"the tallest man of his time\"<!-- estimated at close to seven feet tall by papal ambassadors. -->, very handsome, and a rare leader full of dynamism, quick intelligence, and strength,<ref>Paul Pavlovich, ''The Serbians: the story of a people'', p. 35</ref><ref>William Miller, ''The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro'', p. 273: \"Character of Du\u0161an\"</ref> bearing \"a kingly presence\".<ref>Andrew Archibald Paton, ''Researches on the Danube and the Adriatic, Vol 1'', p. 17</ref> According to contemporary depictions, he had dark hair and brown eyes; in adult age he grew a beard and longer hair.\n\n===Early reign===\n{{main article|Byzantine civil war of 1341\u201347}}\n[[File:Kaljaja1.jpg|thumb|Main Gate of the [[Prizren Fortress]] in [[Prizren]], Du\u0161an's first capital]]\n\nSerbia made some raids into the Macedonia region in late 1331, but a planned major attack on Byzantium was delayed as Du\u0161an had to suppress revolts in Zeta in 1332.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=275}} Du\u0161an's ingratitude toward those who had aided his rise \u2014 the Zetan nobility may have been neglected their promised reward and greater influence \u2014 may have been the cause of the rebellion, which was suppressed in the course of the same year.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=275}}\n\nDu\u0161an began to fight against the Byzantine Empire in 1334, and warfare continued with interruptions of various duration until his death in 1355. Twice he became involved in larger conflicts with the [[Hungarians]], but these clashes were mostly defensive. Du\u0161an's armies were initially defeated by [[Charles I of Hungary]]'s 80,000-strong royal armies in [[\u0160umadija]] in 1336. As the Hungarians advanced south towards a hostile terrain, Du\u0161an's cavalry launched several attacks in the narrow open fields, resulting in a rout of Hungarian troops, which retreated to the north of Danube. Charles I was wounded by an arrow but survived. As a result, the Hungarians lost [[Ma\u010dva]] and [[Belgrade]]. Du\u0161an then focused his attention on the internal affairs of his country, writing, in 1349, the first statute book of the Serbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/szilagyi/szerb.doc|title=Hungarians and Serbs during the centuries|author=K\u00e1roly Szil\u00e1gyi|accessdate=8 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030170224/http://hungarian-history.hu/lib/szilagyi/szerb.doc|archivedate=30 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo the west, Du\u0161an scored victories over Hungarian leader [[Louis the Great]] that gave him eastern half of modern Bosnia, and his coins were minted at [[Kotor]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cAAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA39 Turkey in Europe] by Charles Eliot, pag. 38</ref> Du\u0161an was also successful against Louis' vassals: he defeated the armies of the Croatian ban and the forces of Hungarian voivodes.

His premature death created a large power vacuum in the Balkans, that ultimately enabled Turkish invasion and Turkish rule [[Balkan Wars|until the early 20th century]]. While mounting a crusade against the Turks, he fell ill (possibly poisoned) and died of a fever at [[Devoll District|Devoll]] on 20 December 1355. He was buried in his [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]], the [[Saint Archangels Monastery|Monastery of the Holy Archangels]] near [[Prizren]].\n\nHis empire slowly crumbled. His son and successor [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V]] could not keep the integrity of the Empire intact for long, as several feudal families immensely increased their power, though nominally acknowledging Uro\u0161 V as Emperor. [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], Du\u0161an's half-brother, had proclaimed himself Emperor after the death of Du\u0161an, ruling a large area of Thessaly and Epirus, which he had received from Du\u0161an earlier.\n\nToday Du\u0161an's remains are in the [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade|Church of Saint Mark]] in [[Belgrade]].<ref>Mitchell, Laurence (2010), ''Serbia'', Bradt Travel Guides ed. 3.

First, he cared for the monasteries in which his parents were buried. Both the [[Banjska monastery]], built by King Milutin, where his mother was buried, and the monastery of [[Visoki De\u010dani]], an endowment of his father, were generously looked after. The monastery was built for eight years and it is certain that the Emperor's role in the building process was huge. Between 1337 and 1339, the emperor became ill, and he gave his word that if he survived, he would build a church and monastery in Jerusalem. At the time, there was one Serbian monastery in Jerusalem, dedicated to Archangel Michael (believed to be founded by King Milutin), and a number of Serbian monks at the [[Sinai Peninsula]].\n\nHis greatest endowment was the [[Saint Archangels Monastery]], located near the town of [[Prizren]], in which he was originally buried. Du\u0161an gave many possessions to this monastery, including the forest of Prizren which was supposed to be a special property of the monastery where all precious goods and relics were to be stored.\n\nHis son, Stefan Uro\u0161 V, did not make peace with the Constantinopolitan Patriarch. The first initiave was made by ''despot'' [[Uglje\u0161a]] in 1368, which resulted that the areas under his rule were restored to Constantinople. The final initiative for reconciliation between the churches came from [[Prince Lazar]] in 1375. There is no evidence of an existing cult of Emperor Du\u0161an in the decades after his death. Du\u0161an's charter to Ragusa (Dubrovnik) served as a statute in the future trade between Serbia and Ragusa, and its regulations were deemed inviolable. Emperor Du\u0161an's legacy was esteemed in Ragusa. Later folk tradition in Serbia included various attitudes toward Du\u0161an, mostly negative, made under the influence of the church.\n\n===Church policy===\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | image1    = Erzengelkloster1.jpg\n | caption1  = [[Monastery of the Holy Archangels]] in [[Prizren]]\n | image2    = Treskavec Monastery.jpg\n | caption2  = [[Treskavec Monastery]] near [[Prilep]]\n}}\n\nWith the raising of the Serbian Archbishopric to a Patriarchate, serious changes in the organization of the church followed. [[Joanikije II]] became Patriarch. Bishoprics (Eparchies) were raised to Metropolitanates, and new territories of the Ochrid Archbishopric and Ecumenical Constantinople were added to the jurisdiction of the Serbian church. The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] had Du\u0161an excommunicated in 1350, although this did not affect the religious organization.\n\nUnder Serbian jurisdiction came one of the foremost centers of spirituality - [[Mount Athos]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/?id=QwNlKqyNC7EC&pg=PA66 p. 66]</ref> As of November 1345, Athonite monks accept his supreme rule, and Du\u0161an guaranteed autonomy, also giving a row of economic privileges, with tremendous gifts and endowments. The monks of [[Chilandar]] (the cradle of the Serbian church, founded by [[Saint Sava]], his ancestor) came at the front of the ecclesiastical community.\n\nIn his codex, Du\u0161an accentuates his role as a protector of Christianity and points out the independence of the church. From the codex we can also see care that the parishes are equally arranged both in cities and villages. He was also taking care of few churches and monasteries from [[Bari]] to the west, to [[Jerusalem]] to the east.\n\nBesides Orthodox Christians, there were many Catholics in the Empire, mostly in the coastal cities, [[Kotor|Cattaro]], [[Lezh\u00eb|Alessio]] (modern Lezh\u00eb)) etc. In the court of Du\u0161an there were also Catholics (servants from [[Kotor|Cattaro]] and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], mercenaries, guests etc.). In the central parts, Saxons were in areas active in mining and trading. Serbia under Du\u0161an claimed its identity through Orthodoxy, and opposition to Catholicism.<ref name=\"MadgearuGordon2008\">{{cite book|author1=Alexandru Madgearu|author2=Martin Gordon|title=The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula: Their Medieval Origins|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|p=86}}</ref> Catholics were persecuted, especially native ones such as Catholic Albanians.<ref name=\"MadgearuGordon2008\"/><ref name=\"Murzaku2015\">{{cite book|author=Ines Angeli Murzaku|title=Monasticism in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Republics|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|p=249}}</ref><ref name=\"Hussey1966\">{{cite book|author=Joan Mervyn Hussey|title=The Cambridge Medieval History: The Byzantine Empire V. 2||year=1966|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=540}}</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n===Royal ideology===\nSome historians consider that the goal of Emperor Du\u0161an was to establish a new, Serbian-Greek Empire, replacing the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=310}} [[Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107|\u0106irkovi\u0107]] considered his initial ideology as that of the previous [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian emperors]], who had envisioned co-rulership. However, starting in 1347, relations with [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] worsened, Du\u0161an allied himself with rival [[John V Palaiologos]].\n\nDu\u0161an was the first Serbian monarch who wrote most of his letters in [[Greek language|Greek]], also signing with the Imperial red ink. He was the first to publish [[prostagma]], a kind of Byzantine document, characteristic for Byzantine rulers. In his royal title, ''Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks'', his claim as Eastern Roman (Byzantine) successor is clear. He also gave Byzantine court titles to his nobility,{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=309}} something that would continue into the 16th century.\n\n===Lawmaker===\n[[File:Du\u0161an's Code, Prizren manuscript, 15th c.jpg|thumb|[[Du\u0161an's Code]], the second oldest preserved constitution of Serbia]]\n\nThe most lasting monument to Du\u0161an's rulership was a law code. For the purposes of [[Du\u0161an's Code]], a wealth of charters were published, and some great foreign works of law were translated to Serbian; however, the third section of the Code was new and distinctively Serbian,  albeit with Byzantine influence and attention to a long legal tradition in Serbia. Du\u0161an explained the purpose of his Code in one of in his charters; he intimated that its aims  were spiritual and that the code would help his people to save themselves for the afterlife. The Code was proclaimed on 21 May 1349. in [[Skopje]], and contained 155 clauses, while 66 further clauses were added at [[Serres]] in 1353 or 1354. The authors of the code are not known, but they were probably members of the court who specialised in law.\n\nDu\u0161an's Code proclaims on subjects both secular and ecclesiastic, the more so because Serbia had recently achieved full ecclesiastic autonomy as an independent Orthodox Church under a Patriarchate.<ref>http://againandagaininpeace.com/2012/02/07/the-serbian-church-in-history-the-serbian-patriarchate/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The first 38 clauses relate to the church and they deal with issues that the Medieval Serbian Church faced, while the next 25 clauses relate to the nobility. Civil law is largely excluded, since it was covered in earlier documents, namely [[Saint Sava]]'s  Nomokamon and in [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Du\u0161an's Code originally dealt with criminal law, with heavy emphasis on the concept of lawfulness, which was mostly taken directly from Byzantine law.\n\nThe original manuscript of Du\u0161an's Code does not survive. The Code continued as a de facto constitution under the rule of Du\u0161an's son, Stefan Uro\u0161 V, and after the [[fall of the Serbian Empire]] in 1371, it was used in all the successor provinces. It was officially used in the successor state, [[Serbian Despotate]],<ref name=Sedlar330>Sedlar, p. 330</ref> until its annexation by the Ottoman Empire in 1459. The Code was used as a reference for Serbian communities under Turkish rule, which exercised considerable legal autonomy in civil cases.<ref name=Sedlar330/> The Code was also used in the Serbian autonomical areas under the Republic of Venice, like [[Grbalj]] and [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]].<ref>Sindik, I.

Many foreign mercenaries were in the Serbian army in the 14th century, mostly [[Germans|German]] knights and [[Catalans|Catalan]] halberdiers. Du\u0161an had his personal [[mercenary]] guard on his disposal, consisting of German [[knight]]s lead by [[Palman]], commander of the Serbian \"[[Alemannic Guard]]\", who upon crossing [[Serbia]] to [[Jerusalem]] in 1331, became leader of all mercenaries in the Serbian army. The main strength of the Serbian army were their heavy cavalry, feared for their ferocious charge and staying power.\nThe Serbian expansion in the former territory of Byzantine Empire proceeded without a single major battle, it was based on besieging Greek fortifications.<ref>Jean W Sedlar: East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500 - PAGE: 384, University of Washington Press</ref>\n\n==Name, epithets and titles==\n[[File:Statue of Emperor Du\u0161an in Belgrade.jpg|thumb|Statue of Emperor Du\u0161an in Belgrade]]\n\nHe was titled ''Young King'' as [[heir apparent]] on 6 January 1322 and was entitled the rule of [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]]; thus he ruled as \"King of Zeta\".

Du\u0161an, a contemporary of England's Edward III, is regarded with the same reverence as the Bulgarians feel for Tsar Simeon, the Poles for Sigismund I the Old, and the Czechs for Charles IV. According to Steven Runciman, he was \"perhaps the most powerful ruler in Europe\" during the 14th century.<ref>Steven Runciman, Byzantine Civilization. Cited in Radoman Stankovi\u0107, ''The Code of Serbian Emperor Stephan Dushan'', Serbian Culture of the 14th Century. Volume I</ref> His state was a rival to the regional powers of Byzantium and Hungary, and it encompassed a large territory, which would also be his empire's greatest weakness. By nature a soldier and a conqueror, Du\u0161an also proved to be very able but nonetheless feared ruler. His empire however, slowly crumbled at the hands of his son, as regional aristocrats distanced from the central rule.\n\nThe aim of restoring Serbia as an Empire it once was, was one of the greatest ideals of Serbs, living both in the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian lands. In 1526, [[Jovan Nenad]], in the style of Du\u0161an, proclaimed himself ''Emperor'', when ruling a short-lived state of Serbian provinces under the crown of Hungary.\n\n''The Realm of the Slavs'', written by Ragusian historian [[Mavro Orbin]] (l. ca. 1550-1614), saw Emperor Du\u0161an's actions and works positively. The book served as the primary source about early history of [[South Slavs]] at the time and most of the western historians drew their information on the Slavs from it. Early Serbian historians, even though they wrote according to the sources, were influenced by the ideas of the time they lived in. They made efforts to harmonize with two different traditions: one from brevets{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} and public documents and other from genealogies and narrative writings. Of early historians, most information came from [[Jovan Raji\u0107]] (1726\u20131801), who wrote fifty pages about Du\u0161an's life. Raji\u0107's work had great influence on Serbian culture of that time, and for decades it was the main source of information about Serbian history.\n\nAfter the restoration of Serbia in the 19th century, continuity with the Serbian Middle Ages was accentuated, particularly of its greatest moment - during Emperor Du\u0161an. A political agenda, as with a restoration of his Empire, would find its place in the political programmes of the [[Principality of Serbia]], notably the ''[[Na\u010dertanije]]'' by [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]].\n\n==Family==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= '''Stefan Du\u0161an'''\n|2= [[Stefan De\u010danski]]\n|3= [[Theodora Smilets of Bulgaria]]\n|4= [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia]]\n|5= [[Anna Terter of Bulgaria]]\n|6= [[Smilets of Bulgaria]]\n|7= [[Smiltsena Palaiologina]]\n|8= [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I of Serbia]]\n|9= [[Helen of Anjou]]\n|10= [[George I of Bulgaria]]\n|11= [[Kira Maria Asenina of Bulgaria]]\n|14= [[Constantine Palaiologos (half-brother of Michael VIII)|Constantine Palaiologos]]\n|15= [[Irene Komnene Laskarina Branaina]]\n}}\n[[Image:Family of Serbian Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, De\u010dani.jpg|thumb|Fresco of Du\u0161an, his wife [[Helena of Bulgaria, Empress of Serbia|Helena]], and their son [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V|Uro\u0161]]]]\n\nBy his wife, [[Helena of Bulgaria, Empress of Serbia|Helena of Bulgaria]], Emperor Du\u0161an had at least one child:\n*[[Stefan Uro\u0161 V of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 V]], succeeded his father as Emperor, r. 1355-1371\n\nAccording to contemporary Byzantine historian [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], Du\u0161an also had a daughter:\n* Theodora\nAccording to Gregoras, Du\u0161an was negotiating a potential alliance with [[Orhan of the Ottoman Empire|Orhan]], which would have involved marrying off his daughter to Orhan himself or one of Orhan's sons in 1351.

He was born circa 1308 in Serbia, but with the exile of his father in 1314, the family lived in [[Constantinople]] until 1320, when his father was allowed to return. In Constantinople he learned [[Greek language|Greek]], gained an understanding of Byzantine life and culture, and became acquainted with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He took a lot interest in arts of war; in his youth he fought exceptionally in two battles: in 1329 he defeated the [[ban (title)|ban]] [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromani\u0107]] during the [[War of Hum (1326\u201329)|War of Hum]], and in 1330 the [[Bulgaria]]n emperor [[Michael III Shishman]] in the [[Battle of Velbazhd|Battle of Velbu\u017ed]].

De\u010danski sent an army into Zeta against his son; the army ravaged Skadar (modern [[Shkod\u00ebr]]), but Du\u0161an had crossed the [[Bojana (river)|Bojana river]]. A brief period of anarchy took place in parts of Serbia before father and son concluded peace in April 1331.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} Three months later, De\u010danski ordered Du\u0161an to meet him. Du\u0161an feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Du\u0161an marched from Skadar to [[Nerodimlje]], where he besieged his father.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} De\u010danski fled, and Du\u0161an captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at [[Petrich]]. On 21 August 1331 De\u010danski surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Du\u0161an's advisors, he was imprisoned.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=273}} Du\u0161an was crowned ''King of All Serbian and Maritime lands'' in the first week of September.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}}\n\nThe civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Emperor [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] feared Serbia, as the situation there had settled, and he immediately sought peace with Du\u0161an.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=274}} As Du\u0161an wanted to move against richer Byzantium, the two made peace and an alliance in December 1331.

As the Hungarians advanced south towards a hostile terrain, Du\u0161an's cavalry launched several attacks in the narrow open fields, resulting in a rout of Hungarian troops, which retreated to the north of Danube. Charles I was wounded by an arrow but survived. As a result, the Hungarians lost [[Ma\u010dva]] and [[Belgrade]].

First, he cared for the monasteries in which his parents were buried. Both the [[Banjska monastery]], built by King Milutin, where his mother was buried, and the monastery of [[Visoki De\u010dani]], an endowment of his father, were generously looked after. The monastery was built for eight years and it is certain that the Emperor's role in the building process was huge. Between 1337 and 1339, the emperor became ill, and he gave his word that if he survived, he would build a church and monastery in Jerusalem. At the time, there was one Serbian monastery in Jerusalem, dedicated to Archangel Michael (believed to be founded by King Milutin), and a number of Serbian monks at the [[Sinai Peninsula]].\n\nHis greatest endowment was the [[Saint Archangels Monastery]], located near the town of [[Prizren]], in which he was originally buried. Du\u0161an gave many possessions to this monastery, including the forest of Prizren which was supposed to be a special property of the monastery where all precious goods and relics were to be stored.\n\nHis son, Stefan Uro\u0161 V, did not make peace with the Constantinopolitan Patriarch. The first initiave was made by ''despot'' [[Uglje\u0161a]] in 1368, which resulted that the areas under his rule were restored to Constantinople. The final initiative for reconciliation between the churches came from [[Prince Lazar]] in 1375. There is no evidence of an existing cult of Emperor Du\u0161an in the decades after his death. Du\u0161an's charter to Ragusa (Dubrovnik) served as a statute in the future trade between Serbia and Ragusa, and its regulations were deemed inviolable. Emperor Du\u0161an's legacy was esteemed in Ragusa. Later folk tradition in Serbia included various attitudes toward Du\u0161an, mostly negative, made under the influence of the church.\n\n===Church policy===\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | image1    = Erzengelkloster1.jpg\n | caption1  = [[Monastery of the Holy Archangels]] in [[Prizren]]\n | image2    = Treskavec Monastery.jpg\n | caption2  = [[Treskavec Monastery]] near [[Prilep]]\n}}\n\nWith the raising of the Serbian Archbishopric to a Patriarchate, serious changes in the organization of the church followed. [[Joanikije II]] became Patriarch. Bishoprics (Eparchies) were raised to Metropolitanates, and new territories of the Ochrid Archbishopric and Ecumenical Constantinople were added to the jurisdiction of the Serbian church. The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] had Du\u0161an excommunicated in 1350, although this did not affect the religious organization.\n\nUnder Serbian jurisdiction came one of the foremost centers of spirituality - [[Mount Athos]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/?id=QwNlKqyNC7EC&pg=PA66 p. 66]</ref> As of November 1345, Athonite monks accept his supreme rule, and Du\u0161an guaranteed autonomy, also giving a row of economic privileges, with tremendous gifts and endowments. The monks of [[Chilandar]] (the cradle of the Serbian church, founded by [[Saint Sava]], his ancestor) came at the front of the ecclesiastical community.\n\nIn his codex, Du\u0161an accentuates his role as a protector of Christianity and points out the independence of the church. From the codex we can also see care that the parishes are equally arranged both in cities and villages. He was also taking care of few churches and monasteries from [[Bari]] to the west, to [[Jerusalem]] to the east.\n\nBesides Orthodox Christians, there were many Catholics in the Empire, mostly in the coastal cities, [[Kotor|Cattaro]], [[Lezh\u00eb|Alessio]] (modern Lezh\u00eb)) etc. In the court of Du\u0161an there were also Catholics (servants from [[Kotor|Cattaro]] and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], mercenaries, guests etc.). In the central parts, Saxons were in areas active in mining and trading. Serbia under Du\u0161an claimed its identity through Orthodoxy, and opposition to Catholicism.<ref name=\"MadgearuGordon2008\">{{cite book|author1=Alexandru Madgearu|author2=Martin Gordon|title=The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula: Their Medieval Origins|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|p=86}}</ref> Catholics were persecuted, especially native ones such as Catholic Albanians.<ref name=\"MadgearuGordon2008\"/><ref name=\"Murzaku2015\">{{cite book|author=Ines Angeli Murzaku|title=Monasticism in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Republics|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|p=249}}</ref><ref name=\"Hussey1966\">{{cite book|author=Joan Mervyn Hussey|title=The Cambridge Medieval History: The Byzantine Empire V. 2||year=1966|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=540}}</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n===Royal ideology===\nSome historians consider that the goal of Emperor Du\u0161an was to establish a new, Serbian-Greek Empire, replacing the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=310}} [[Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107|\u0106irkovi\u0107]] considered his initial ideology as that of the previous [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian emperors]], who had envisioned co-rulership. However, starting in 1347, relations with [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] worsened, Du\u0161an allied himself with rival [[John V Palaiologos]].\n\nDu\u0161an was the first Serbian monarch who wrote most of his letters in [[Greek language|Greek]], also signing with the Imperial red ink. He was the first to publish [[prostagma]], a kind of Byzantine document, characteristic for Byzantine rulers. In his royal title, ''Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks'', his claim as Eastern Roman (Byzantine) successor is clear. He also gave Byzantine court titles to his nobility,{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=309}} something that would continue into the 16th century.\n\n===Lawmaker===\n[[File:Du\u0161an's Code, Prizren manuscript, 15th c.jpg|thumb|[[Du\u0161an's Code]], the second oldest preserved constitution of Serbia]]\n\nThe most lasting monument to Du\u0161an's rulership was a law code. For the purposes of [[Du\u0161an's Code]], a wealth of charters were published, and some great foreign works of law were translated to Serbian; however, the third section of the Code was new and distinctively Serbian,  albeit with Byzantine influence and attention to a long legal tradition in Serbia. Du\u0161an explained the purpose of his Code in one of in his charters; he intimated that its aims  were spiritual and that the code would help his people to save themselves for the afterlife. The Code was proclaimed on 21 May 1349. in [[Skopje]], and contained 155 clauses, while 66 further clauses were added at [[Serres]] in 1353 or 1354. The authors of the code are not known, but they were probably members of the court who specialised in law.\n\nDu\u0161an's Code proclaims on subjects both secular and ecclesiastic, the more so because Serbia had recently achieved full ecclesiastic autonomy as an independent Orthodox Church under a Patriarchate.<ref>http://againandagaininpeace.com/2012/02/07/the-serbian-church-in-history-the-serbian-patriarchate/{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The first 38 clauses relate to the church and they deal with issues that the Medieval Serbian Church faced, while the next 25 clauses relate to the nobility. Civil law is largely excluded, since it was covered in earlier documents, namely [[Saint Sava]]'s  Nomokamon and in [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Du\u0161an's Code originally dealt with criminal law, with heavy emphasis on the concept of lawfulness, which was mostly taken directly from Byzantine law.\n\nThe original manuscript of Du\u0161an's Code does not survive. The Code continued as a de facto constitution under the rule of Du\u0161an's son, Stefan Uro\u0161 V, and after the [[fall of the Serbian Empire]] in 1371, it was used in all the successor provinces. It was officially used in the successor state, [[Serbian Despotate]],<ref name=Sedlar330>Sedlar, p. 330</ref> until its annexation by the Ottoman Empire in 1459. The Code was used as a reference for Serbian communities under Turkish rule, which exercised considerable legal autonomy in civil cases.<ref name=Sedlar330/> The Code was also used in the Serbian autonomical areas under the Republic of Venice, like [[Grbalj]] and [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]].<ref>Sindik, I.

Many foreign mercenaries were in the Serbian army in the 14th century, mostly [[Germans|German]] knights and [[Catalans|Catalan]] halberdiers. Du\u0161an had his personal [[mercenary]] guard on his disposal, consisting of German [[knight]]s lead by [[Palman]], commander of the Serbian \"[[Alemannic Guard]]\", who upon crossing [[Serbia]] to [[Jerusalem]] in 1331, became leader of all mercenaries in the Serbian army. The main strength of the Serbian army were their heavy cavalry, feared for their ferocious charge and staying power.\nThe Serbian expansion in the former territory of Byzantine Empire proceeded without a single major battle, it was based on besieging Greek fortifications.<ref>Jean W Sedlar: East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500 - PAGE: 384, University of Washington Press</ref>\n\n==Name, epithets and titles==\n[[File:Statue of Emperor Du\u0161an in Belgrade.jpg|thumb|Statue of Emperor Du\u0161an in Belgrade]]\n\nHe was titled ''Young King'' as [[heir apparent]] on 6 January 1322 and was entitled the rule of [[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]]; thus he ruled as \"King of Zeta\". In 1331 he succeeded his father as \"King of all Serbian and Maritime Lands\". In 1343 his title was \"King of Serbia, Greeks, Albania and the coast\". In 1345 he began calling himself ''tsar'', Emperor, and in 1345 he proclaimed himself \"Emperor of Serbs and Romans (Greeks)\". On 16 April 1346 he was crowned ''[[Emperor of Serbs and Greeks]]''.

Du\u0161an, a contemporary of England's Edward III, is regarded with the same reverence as the Bulgarians feel for Tsar Simeon, the Poles for Sigismund I the Old, and the Czechs for Charles IV. According to Steven Runciman, he was \"perhaps the most powerful ruler in Europe\" during the 14th century.<ref>Steven Runciman, Byzantine Civilization. Cited in Radoman Stankovi\u0107, ''The Code of Serbian Emperor Stephan Dushan'', Serbian Culture of the 14th Century. Volume I</ref> His state was a rival to the regional powers of Byzantium and Hungary, and it encompassed a large territory, which would also be his empire's greatest weakness. By nature a soldier and a conqueror, Du\u0161an also proved to be very able but nonetheless feared ruler. His empire however, slowly crumbled at the hands of his son, as regional aristocrats distanced from the central rule.\n\nThe aim of restoring Serbia as an Empire it once was, was one of the greatest ideals of Serbs, living both in the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian lands. In 1526, [[Jovan Nenad]], in the style of Du\u0161an, proclaimed himself ''Emperor'', when ruling a short-lived state of Serbian provinces under the crown of Hungary.\n\n''The Realm of the Slavs'', written by Ragusian historian [[Mavro Orbin]] (l. ca. 1550-1614), saw Emperor Du\u0161an's actions and works positively. The book served as the primary source about early history of [[South Slavs]] at the time and most of the western historians drew their information on the Slavs from it. Early Serbian historians, even though they wrote according to the sources, were influenced by the ideas of the time they lived in. They made efforts to harmonize with two different traditions: one from brevets{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} and public documents and other from genealogies and narrative writings. Of early historians, most information came from [[Jovan Raji\u0107]] (1726\u20131801), who wrote fifty pages about Du\u0161an's life. Raji\u0107's work had great influence on Serbian culture of that time, and for decades it was the main source of information about Serbian history.\n\nAfter the restoration of Serbia in the 19th century, continuity with the Serbian Middle Ages was accentuated, particularly of its greatest moment - during Emperor Du\u0161an. A political agenda, as with a restoration of his Empire, would find its place in the political programmes of the [[Principality of Serbia]], notably the ''[[Na\u010dertanije]]'' by [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]].\n\n==Family==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= '''Stefan Du\u0161an'''\n|2= [[Stefan De\u010danski]]\n|3= [[Theodora Smilets of Bulgaria]]\n|4= [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia]]\n|5= [[Anna Terter of Bulgaria]]\n|6= [[Smilets of Bulgaria]]\n|7= [[Smiltsena Palaiologina]]\n|8= [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I of Serbia]]\n|9= [[Helen of Anjou]]\n|10= [[George I of Bulgaria]]\n|11= [[Kira Maria Asenina of Bulgaria]]\n|14= [[Constantine Palaiologos (half-brother of Michael VIII)|Constantine Palaiologos]]\n|15= [[Irene Komnene Laskarina Branaina]]\n}}\n[[Image:Family of Serbian Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an, De\u010dani.jpg|thumb|Fresco of Du\u0161an, his wife [[Helena of Bulgaria, Empress of Serbia|Helena]], and their son [[Stefan Uro\u0161 V|Uro\u0161]]]]\n\nBy his wife, [[Helena of Bulgaria, Empress of Serbia|Helena of Bulgaria]], Emperor Du\u0161an had at least one child:\n*[[Stefan Uro\u0161 V of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 V]], succeeded his father as Emperor, r. 1355-1371\n\nAccording to contemporary Byzantine historian [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], Du\u0161an also had a daughter:\n* Theodora\nAccording to Gregoras, Du\u0161an was negotiating a potential alliance with [[Orhan of the Ottoman Empire|Orhan]], which would have involved marrying off his daughter to Orhan himself or one of Orhan's sons in 1351. However, these negotiations broke down after the Serbian emissaries were attacked by [[Nikephoros II Orsini|Nikephoros Orsini]] - the marriage proposal was withdrawn and Serbia and the Ottoman Empire resumed hostilities.<ref>[[George Ostrogorsky]] (1986), ''Byzantine sources on the history of the peoples of Yugoslavia'', (Institute of Byzantine Studies), VI-280.</ref> Theodora most likely died between 1352-1354.\n\nSome historians speculate that the couple had another child, a daughter.

The film features the voices of [[E. G. Daily]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Christine Cavanaugh]], [[Kath Soucie]], [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]], [[Cree Summer]], and [[Charlie Adler]], along with guest stars [[David Spade]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Tim Curry]]. The events of the film take place before the [[List of Rugrats episodes|sixth season]] of ''Rugrats''.\n\nPlans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with [[Ren and Stimpy]] and [[Doug (series)|Doug]], began when Nickelodeon made a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce films between 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when contract expired, development of the film restarted with [[Paramount Pictures]] since Nick's parent company, [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], purchased the studio in 1994.\n\nThe film holds the distinction for being the first animated film from [[Nickelodeon Movies]], as well as the first to be based on a Nicktoon. Paramount Pictures originally released it in the United States on November 20, 1998.<ref name=AFIRugrats/> The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and grossed $141 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Didi Pickles]] is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with her second baby, which she believes will be a girl while everyone else believes it will be a boy. Didi goes into labor during her baby shower and her friends rush her to the hospital. While this is happening, the kids crawl off and explore a nursery area before being found by the other parents. When the baby is finally born after a montage of [[Reincarnation|past lives]], it turns out to a boy and they name him [[Dil Pickles|Dil]].\n\nDil quickly becomes a very spoiled and mean baby, crying non-stop for attention, not listening to his mom and dad, keeping all of the toys for himself, and refusing to share with [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]]. After a nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommy's teddy bear, their father, [[Stu Pickles|Stu]] has a conversation with him about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has, assuring him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside, which he calls his \"sponsitility\" (his term for responsibility).\n\nWhen Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the hospital despite Tommy's disapproval, and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a [[Reptar]] Wagon which Stu had built for a contest. Along the way, Dil secretly steals [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica's]] Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, [[List of Rugrats characters|Spike]] and they embark on a quest to find the babies and retrieve Cynthia.\n\nThe babies eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. They spot a ranger's cabin where they believe a \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]) lives, and decide to go there, believing that it can take them home. After an encounter with a gang of runaway circus monkeys, Dil is taken away by them. Tommy vows to find Dil by himself, after [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Phil and Lil]] agree they are better off without him.\n\nMeanwhile, the parents find out that the babies are missing and try to find them. However, it becomes a media sensation with numerous news reporters constantly asking the adults questions and intentionally enrages Stu's brother [[Drew Pickles|Drew]] into attacking Stu by telling him he lost Angelica.\n\nTommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully.\n\nAfter the storm, the other babies find Tommy and Dil, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the \"lizard\". While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys, but are then scared off by a [[wolf]] who's been hunting down the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via a [[pterodactyl]]-like aircraft he made, finally finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall by landing on a strut of the bridge. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys with their circus owners. The monkeys attack Rex Pester, the most obnoxious of all the news reporters, much to Betty and Charlotte's amusement. Dil finally learns to share when he drinks half of a bottle of formula and gives the other half to Tommy. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group after he assists them in getting an ice cream sundae form the top shelf of the refrigerator.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Grandpa Lou is sleeping in the Reptar Wagon when Grandpa Boris' goat kicks it, sending both the wagon and Grandpa down the street and presumably starting another adventure all over again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rugrats characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[E.

The first attempt was in 1993, when [[Nickelodeon]] made a two-year contract deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce new material, but a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their properties, one of those properties that mentioned was ''[[Rugrats]]'', alongside that the others were ''[[Doug (series)|Doug]]'' and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show#Nick-Fox film deal|The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'',<ref name=\"RugratsRotten\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rugrats_movie/|title=The Rugrats Movie|date=November 20, 1998|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en|title=Toledo Blade \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-08-13}}</ref> but the contract expired in 1995, with no movies produced (although ''Doug'' eventually got a [[Doug's 1st Movie|theatrical film]] from [[Disney]] in March 1999). In 1994, [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] acquired [[Paramount Pictures]], and Paramount would distribute the movies instead, development on the movie immediately started a year later after both the acquisition of Paramount and the deal with Fox expired.\n\nTwo months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \"The Family Tree\" was aired as the final episode of [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 5 (1998)|the fifth season.]] Both the film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\", that aired during the [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 8 (2001-03)|show's eighth season]] on June 1, 2002.\n\nTwo songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS,  DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on [[CBS]] and [[Nickelodeon]] television airings of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bootlegcomparisons.com/2019/03/17/the-rugrats-movie-dvd-vs-cbs-television-broadcast/|title=The Rugrats Movie: DVD Vs.

This short was later broadcast in ''CatDog'' Episode 21. However, the [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Laserdisc]] release contains a different ''CatDog'' short from Episode 28 titled \"''Winslow's Home Videos''\", in which Winslow shows clips of some of his favorite home videos featuring CatDog's wacky antics.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Home video===\n''The Rugrats Movie'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on March 30, 1999 by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]], which was reprinted many times. Paramount also released the film on [[Laserdisc]]. In 2011, the film was re-released in a three-disc trilogy set alongside its sequels, in honor of ''Rugrats''' 20th anniversary. In addition, it was re-released in some movie sets by Paramount, in 2016 with all the non-sequel Nickelodeon-animated movies up to ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', as well as a separate 2-disc set with ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]''.<ref name=BillboardHomeVideo>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Seth|title=Paramount Preps For 'Rugrats' Vid|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yg0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7-IA5&dq=%22the+rugrats+movie%22+vhs+march+1999#v=onepage&q=%22the%20rugrats%20movie%22%20vhs%20march%201999|work=Billboard|accessdate=April 9, 2014|page=6|date=January 23, 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"rotten\" />\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 3, 1998\n| recorded   = 1998\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| length     = 41:51\n| label      = [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], [[Nickelodeon Records|Nickelodeon]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = Rugrats soundtrack\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie#Soundtrack|Rugrats in Paris: Music From the Motion Picture]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Take Me There (Blackstreet & M\u00fda song)|Take Me There]]\n | single1date = February 2, 1999\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}} [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0nfwxq9jldke link]\n| rev2 = [[Entertainment Weekly]]\n| rev2Score = C [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273982,00.html link]\n}}\n''The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture'' was released on November 3, 1998.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DHZX |title=The Rugrats Movie: Music From The Motion Picture [Enhanced CD] [ENHANCED] [SOUNDTRACK] | accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref> The enhanced soundtrack contained thirteen tracks, bonus CD-ROM demos and commercials.<ref name=\"cd\"/> [[Amazon.com]]'s Richard Gehr praised the CD for \"[bridging] demographics as nimbly as the [original] show itself [did]\" and for songs \"fans of all ages will love\".<ref name=\"cd\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s David Browne rated the ''Music From the Motion Picture'' with a C.<ref name=\"EWcd\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273982,00.html |date=January 8, 1999 |title=The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture (1998) |first=David |last=Browne | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=December 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBrowne noted that, while the soundtrack is enjoyable for children and does \"[make] concessions\" for parents, adults may dislike the amount of rap.<ref name=\"EWcd\"/> [[Allmusic]]'s William Ruhlmann reviewed the soundtrack positively, saying \"the result\" of the singers and songs \"is a romp in keeping with the tone of the show and the film\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0nfwxq9jldke|title=Rugrats: The Movie Original Soundtrack| website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=December 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\n\u2018The Rugrats Movie: Music from the Motion Picture'' spent twenty six weeks on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at #19.<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/album/original-soundtrack/rugrats-the-movie/327843|title=Rugrats: The Movie&nbsp;\u2013 Original...| work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] | accessdate=December 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOne song written for the film's soundtrack that was ultimately removed was \"(Safe in This) Sky Life\", a new track by English rock musician [[David Bowie]]; the song marked a reunion with longtime collaborator [[Tony Visconti]], who would go on to produce all of Bowie's material from 2002 up until [[Death of David Bowie|his death in 2016]].

Daily]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Christine Cavanaugh]], [[Kath Soucie]], [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]], [[Cree Summer]], and [[Charlie Adler]], along with guest stars [[David Spade]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Tim Curry]]. The events of the film take place before the [[List of Rugrats episodes|sixth season]] of ''Rugrats''.\n\nPlans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with [[Ren and Stimpy]] and [[Doug (series)|Doug]], began when Nickelodeon made a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce films between 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when contract expired, development of the film restarted with [[Paramount Pictures]] since Nick's parent company, [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], purchased the studio in 1994.\n\nThe film holds the distinction for being the first animated film from [[Nickelodeon Movies]], as well as the first to be based on a Nicktoon. Paramount Pictures originally released it in the United States on November 20, 1998.<ref name=AFIRugrats/> The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics and grossed $141 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Didi Pickles]] is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with her second baby, which she believes will be a girl while everyone else believes it will be a boy. Didi goes into labor during her baby shower and her friends rush her to the hospital. While this is happening, the kids crawl off and explore a nursery area before being found by the other parents. When the baby is finally born after a montage of [[Reincarnation|past lives]], it turns out to a boy and they name him [[Dil Pickles|Dil]].\n\nDil quickly becomes a very spoiled and mean baby, crying non-stop for attention, not listening to his mom and dad, keeping all of the toys for himself, and refusing to share with [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]]. After a nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommy's teddy bear, their father, [[Stu Pickles|Stu]] has a conversation with him about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has, assuring him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside, which he calls his \"sponsitility\" (his term for responsibility).\n\nWhen Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the hospital despite Tommy's disapproval, and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a [[Reptar]] Wagon which Stu had built for a contest. Along the way, Dil secretly steals [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica's]] Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, [[List of Rugrats characters|Spike]] and they embark on a quest to find the babies and retrieve Cynthia.\n\nThe babies eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. They spot a ranger's cabin where they believe a \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]) lives, and decide to go there, believing that it can take them home. After an encounter with a gang of runaway circus monkeys, Dil is taken away by them. Tommy vows to find Dil by himself, after [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Phil and Lil]] agree they are better off without him.\n\nMeanwhile, the parents find out that the babies are missing and try to find them. However, it becomes a media sensation with numerous news reporters constantly asking the adults questions and intentionally enrages Stu's brother [[Drew Pickles|Drew]] into attacking Stu by telling him he lost Angelica.\n\nTommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully.\n\nAfter the storm, the other babies find Tommy and Dil, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the \"lizard\". While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys, but are then scared off by a [[wolf]] who's been hunting down the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via a [[pterodactyl]]-like aircraft he made, finally finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall by landing on a strut of the bridge. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys with their circus owners. The monkeys attack Rex Pester, the most obnoxious of all the news reporters, much to Betty and Charlotte's amusement. Dil finally learns to share when he drinks half of a bottle of formula and gives the other half to Tommy. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group after he assists them in getting an ice cream sundae form the top shelf of the refrigerator.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Grandpa Lou is sleeping in the Reptar Wagon when Grandpa Boris' goat kicks it, sending both the wagon and Grandpa down the street and presumably starting another adventure all over again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rugrats characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[E.

The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS,  DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on [[CBS]] and [[Nickelodeon]] television airings of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bootlegcomparisons.com/2019/03/17/the-rugrats-movie-dvd-vs-cbs-television-broadcast/|title=The Rugrats Movie: DVD Vs.

From 1924-25, he attended [[Ohio University]] in Athens (one year) and the [[University of Notre Dame]], which he left after two weeks because there were no art courses. In between, Smith took a summer job working on the assembly line of an automobile factory. He then briefly studied art and poetry at [[George Washington University]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>[http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/david-smith/#detail=/bio/in-depth-david-smith/&collection=david-smith In Depth: David Smith] [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington, D.C.</ref>\n\nMoving to [[New York City, New York|New York]] in 1926, he met [[Dorothy Dehner]] (to whom he was married from 1927 to 1952) and, on her advice,<ref name=MOMA>[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=5480 David Smith] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> joined her painting studies at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Among his teachers were the American painter [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and the Czech modernist painter [[Jan Matulka]], who had studied with [[Hans Hofmann]]. Matulka introduced Smith to the work of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]]. In 1929, Smith met [[John D. Graham]], who later introduced him to the welded-steel sculpture of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]].<ref name=Guggenheim>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/715 David Smith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107002108/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/715 |date=2014-01-07 }} [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Early work===\nSmith\u2019s early friendship with painters such as [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Milton Avery]] was reinforced during the Depression of the 1930s, when he participated in the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] in New York.<ref name=MOMA/> Through the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist John Graham, Smith met avant-garde artists such as [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Arshile Gorky]] and [[Willem de Kooning]]. He also discovered the [[welded sculpture]]s of [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], which led to an increasing interest in combining painting and construction.\n\nIn the [[Virgin Islands]] in 1931\u201332, Smith made his first sculpture from pieces of coral.<ref name=Guggenheim/> In 1932, he installed a forge and anvil in his studio at the farm in [[Bolton Landing]] that he and Dehner had bought a few years earlier. Smith started by making three-dimensional objects from wood, wire, coral, soldered metal and other found materials but soon graduated to using an oxyacetylene torch to weld metal heads, which are probably the first welded metal sculptures ever made in the United States. A single work may consist of several materials, differentiated by varied patinas and polychromy.<ref name=MOMA/>\n[[File:Ancient Household.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early Smith: ''Ancient Household'' of 1945, bronze, in the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]\n\nIn 1940, the Smiths distanced themselves from the New York art scene and moved permanently to [[Bolton Landing, New York|Bolton Landing]] near [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] in [[Upstate New York]]. At Bolton Landing, he ran his studio like a factory, stocked with large amounts of raw material.<ref name=MOMA/> The artist would put his sculptures in what is referred to as an upper and lower field, and sometimes he would put them in rows, \"as if they were farm crops\".<ref name=Zimmer>William Zimmer (September 19, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/nyregion/art-the-sculptures-of-david-smith.html \"The Sculptures Of David Smith\"] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Smith worked as a welder for the [[American Locomotive Company]], [[Schenectady, NY]] assembling locomotives and M7 tanks. He taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].<ref name=theartstory>{{cite web|url=http://theartstory.org/artist-smith-david.htm|title=David Smith Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|author=|date=|website=theartstory.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===After 1945===\nAfter the war, with the additional skills that he had acquired, Smith released his pent-up energy and ideas in a burst of creation between 1945 and 1946. His output soared and he went about perfecting his own, very personal symbolism.\n\nTraditionally, metal sculpture meant bronze casts, which artisans produced using a mold made by the artist. Smith, however, made his sculptures from scratch, welding together pieces of steel and other metals with his torch, in much the same way that a painter applied paint to a canvas; his sculptures are almost always unique works.\n\nSmith, who often said, \"I belong with the painters\", made sculptures of subjects that had never before been shown in three dimensions. He made sculptural landscapes (e.g. ''Hudson River Landscape''), still life sculptures (e.g. ''Head as Still Life'') and even a sculpture of a page of writing (''The Letter''). Perhaps his most revolutionary concept was that the only difference between painting and sculpture was the addition of a third dimension; he declared that the sculptor's \"conception is as free as a that of the painter. His wealth of response is as great as his draftsmanship.\"<ref>''Everyday Art Quarterly'' 23 (1952)</ref>\n\nSmith was awarded the prestigious [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim]] Fellowship in 1950, which was renewed the following year. Freed from financial constraints, he made more and larger pieces, and for the first time was able to afford to make whole sculptures in stainless steel. He also began his practice of making sculptures in series, the first of which were the ''[[Agricola I|Agricolas]]'' of 1951-59. He steadily gained recognition, lecturing at universities and participating in symposia. He separated from Dehner in 1950, with divorce in 1952.<ref name=theartstory/> During his time as a visiting artist at [[Indiana University]], Bloomington, in 1955 and 1956, Smith produced the ''Forgings'', a series of eleven industrially forged steel sculptures.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (January 2, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/arts/design/david-smith-the-forgings-at-gagosian-gallery.html The Silent Totems of a Restless Quest] ''The New York Times''.</ref> To create the ''Forgings'', he cut, plugged, flattened, pinched and bent each steel bar, later polishing, rusting, painting, lacquering or waxing its surface.<ref name=Forgings>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/david-smith--november-08-2013 \"David Smith: The Forgings, October 29, 2013 - January 11, 2014\"] [[Gagosian Gallery]], New York.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s, Smith explored the technique of burnishing his stainless steel sculptures with a sander, a technique that would find its fullest expression in his ''[[Cubi]]'' series (1961\u201365). The scale of his works continued to increase - ''Tanktotem III'' of 1953 is 7' tall; ''Zig I'' from 1961 is 8'; and ''5 Ciarcs'' from 1963 is almost 13' tall. Finally, in the late 1950s Smith began using spray paint - then still a new medium - to create stenciled shapes out of negative space, in works closely tied to his late-career turn toward geometric planes and solids.<ref>[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/smith/highlights7.html David Smith: A Centennial, February 3 - May 14, 2006] [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York.</ref>\n\nHis family was also getting bigger; he remarried and had two daughters, Rebecca (born 1954) and Candida (born 1955). He named quite a few of his later works in honor of his children (e.g., ''Bec-Dida Day'', 1963, ''Rebecca Circle'', 1961, ''Hi Candida'', 1965).\n\nThe February 1960 issue of ''Arts'' magazine was devoted to Smith\u2019s work; later that year he had his first West Coast exhibition, a solo show at the [[Everett Ellin|Everett Ellin Gallery]] in Los Angeles. The following year he rejected a third-place award at the Carnegie International, saying \u201cthe awards system in our day is archaic.\u201d<ref>Cleve Gray, ''David Smith by David Smith'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1968), 40</ref>\n\nIn 1962, [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] invited Smith to make sculptures for the [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in [[Spoleto]].<ref name=Zimmer/> Given open access to an abandoned steel mill and provided with a group of assistants, he produced an amazing 27 pieces in 30 days. Not yet finished with the themes he developed, he had tons of steel shipped from Italy to Bolton Landing, and over the next 18 months he made another 25 sculptures known as the ''[[Voltron (David Smith)|Voltri-Bolton]]'' series.\n\nHe died in a car crash near [[Bennington, Vermont]] on May 23, 1965.<ref name=Forgings/> He was 59 years old.\n\n===Paintings and drawings===\n[[File:Untitled (Green Linear Nude) by David Smith, c. 1964, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Untitled'' (''Green Linear Nude'') by David Smith, c. 1964, [[Honolulu Museum of Art]]]]\n\nSmith continued to paint and draw throughout his life. By 1953, he was producing between 300 and 400 drawings a year. His subjects encompassed the figure and landscape, as well as gestural, almost calligraphic marks made with egg yolk, Chinese ink and brushes and, in the late 1950s, the \"sprays\".<ref name=MOMA/> He usually signed his drawings with the ancient Greek letters delta and sigma, meant to stand for his initials.<ref>Christopher Knight (April 14, 2011), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/04/art-review-david-smith-drawing-space-at-margo-leavin-gallery.html#sthash.MX8tCaxg.dpuf Art review: 'David Smith: Drawing Space' at Margo Leavin Gallery] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> In the winter of 1963-64, he began a series known as the \"Last Nudes\". The paintings in this series are essentially drawings of nudes on canvas. He drew with [[enamel paint]] squeezed from syringes or bottles onto a canvas spread onto the floor.<ref>Honolulu Museum of Art, wall label, ''Untitled'' (''Green Linear Nude'') by David Smith, c. 1964, enamel on canvas, accession TCM.2007.1.5</ref> ''Untitled'' (''Green Linear Nude'') is painted in a metallic olive green enamel, and exemplifies the artist's late [[action painting]]s.\n\n===Major works===\n<!-- [[File:Smithdavid.jpg|200px|left|David Smith, ca. 1942]] EVIL DELETION BOT!-->\nSmith often worked in series.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=81812 David Smith, ''Cubi X'' (1963)] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref>  He is perhaps best known for the ''[[Cubi]]s'', which were among the last pieces he completed before his death. The sculptures in this series are made of stainless steel with a hand-brushed finish reminiscent of the gestural strokes of [[Abstract Expressionist]] painting. The ''[[Cubi]]'' works consist of arrangements of geometric shapes, which highlight his interest in balance and the contrast between positive and negative space.\n\nPrior to the ''[[Cubi]]s'', Smith gained widespread attention for his sculptures often described as \"drawings in space\".  He was originally trained as a painter and draftsman, and sculptures such as ''Hudson River Landscape'' (1950) and ''The Letter'' (both 1950) blurred the distinctions between sculpture and painting. These works make use of delicate tracery rather than solid form, with a two-dimensional appearance that contradicts the traditional idea of sculpture in the round.\n\nAs with many artists from the Modernist period, including [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]], much of Smith's early work was heavily influenced by [[Surrealism]]. Some of the best examples are seen in the ''Medals for Dishonor'', a series of bronze reliefs that speak out against the atrocities of war. Images from these medals are strange, nightmarish, and often violent. His own descriptions give a vivid picture of the medals and strongly express condemnation of these acts, such as this statement about ''Propaganda for War'' (1939\u201340):\n\n<blockquote>The rape of the mind by machines of death \u2013 the Hand of God points to atrocities. Atop the curly bull the red cross nurse blows the clarinet. The horse is dead in this bullfight arena \u2013 the bull is docile, can be ridden.<ref>''David Smith: Medals for Dishonor,'' (New York: Independent Curators Incorporated, 1996), 48.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Gallery of works==\n<gallery widths=\"110px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Saw Head (1933) by David Smith (5899787866).jpg|David Smith, ''Saw Head'', 1933; sculpture of iron and bronze, painted\nFile:Home of the welder Tate Modern L01025 n02.jpg|David Smith, ''Home of the welder'', 1945; steel sculpture, painted\nFile:David Smith02.jpg|David Smith, ''title unknown'', c. 1940s; steel sculpture, painted\nFile:Voltri XV.jpg|David Smith, ''[[Voltri XV]]'', 1962; steel sculpture\nFile:Cubi xii 6283224.JPG|David Smith, ''[[Cubi]] XII'', 1963; sculpture of stainless steel\nFile:Cubi XIII by David Smith.jpg|David Smith, ''[[Cubi]] XIII'', 1963-64; sculpture of stainless steel \nFile:David_Smith,_Big_Diamond_(1952)_(34885347616)_cropped.jpg|David Smith, 1952; Big Diamond\n</gallery>\n\n==Legal controversy==\nIn the fall of 2013, Smith's estate became aware of a series of recent sculptures by the artist Lauren Clay, in which Clay appropriated the central geometrical motifs from Smith's ''Cubi''. Before Clay's sculptures were to be exhibited at the New Jersey sculpture park Grounds for Sculpture in October 2013, the estate contacted her and demanded an \"accounting\" of the work.<ref>http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/966834/david-smiths-estate-demands-house-arrest-for-a-young-artists</ref> Smith's estate accused Clay of copyright infringement and, at various points, demanded that she destroy her sculptures, or at least stop selling them. Smith's estate also threatened to sue Grounds for Sculpture if the sculptures were exhibited. However, Clay understood her works\u2014much smaller in scale and produced out of colored paper\u2014as critical commentary on Smith's iconic metal sculptures. As such, Clay felt that her sculptures constituted fair use under US copyright law. Eventually, the estate and Clay were able to reach an out-of-court settlement. Clay's exhibition at Grounds for Sculpture was initially canceled and then eventually rescheduled a year later. The estate agreed to allow Clay to exhibit and even sell the seven works, while Clay agreed that she would not add to the series or begin new works that referenced Smith's sculptures without mutual consent.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/arts/design/roberta-smiths-2013-art-highlights-and-some-concerns.html</ref> Clay also agreed not to make multiples of her works, and to furnish an exhibition artist statement, when possible, attributing Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/smith-estate-reveals-terms-of-agreement-with-brooklyn-artist/|title=Smith Estate Reveals Terms of Agreement with Brooklyn Artist - Art in America|author=|date=|website=artinamericamagazine.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nSmith\u2019s first solo show of drawings and welded-steel sculpture was held at the [[Willard Gallery]] in New York in 1938.<ref name=Guggenheim/> In 1941, Smith sculptures were included in two traveling exhibitions organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and were shown at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s Annual exhibition in New York.\n\nSmith represented the United States in the 1951 [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial]] and at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1954 and 1958. Six of his sculptures were included in an exhibition organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, that traveled to Paris, Zurich, D\u00fcsseldorf, Stockholm, Helsinki, and Oslo in 1953-54; he was given a retrospective exhibition by MoMA in 1957. In 1961, the MoMA organized an exhibition of fifty Smith sculptures that traveled throughout the United States until the spring of 1963.

From 1924-25, he attended [[Ohio University]] in Athens (one year) and the [[University of Notre Dame]], which he left after two weeks because there were no art courses. In between, Smith took a summer job working on the assembly line of an automobile factory. He then briefly studied art and poetry at [[George Washington University]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>[http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/david-smith/#detail=/bio/in-depth-david-smith/&collection=david-smith In Depth: David Smith] [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington, D.C.</ref>\n\nMoving to [[New York City, New York|New York]] in 1926, he met [[Dorothy Dehner]] (to whom he was married from 1927 to 1952) and, on her advice,<ref name=MOMA>[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=5480 David Smith] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> joined her painting studies at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Among his teachers were the American painter [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and the Czech modernist painter [[Jan Matulka]], who had studied with [[Hans Hofmann]]. Matulka introduced Smith to the work of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]]. In 1929, Smith met [[John D. Graham]], who later introduced him to the welded-steel sculpture of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]].<ref name=Guggenheim>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/715 David Smith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107002108/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/715 |date=2014-01-07 }} [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Early work===\nSmith\u2019s early friendship with painters such as [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Milton Avery]] was reinforced during the Depression of the 1930s, when he participated in the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] in New York.<ref name=MOMA/> Through the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist John Graham, Smith met avant-garde artists such as [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Arshile Gorky]] and [[Willem de Kooning]]. He also discovered the [[welded sculpture]]s of [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], which led to an increasing interest in combining painting and construction.\n\nIn the [[Virgin Islands]] in 1931\u201332, Smith made his first sculpture from pieces of coral.<ref name=Guggenheim/> In 1932, he installed a forge and anvil in his studio at the farm in [[Bolton Landing]] that he and Dehner had bought a few years earlier. Smith started by making three-dimensional objects from wood, wire, coral, soldered metal and other found materials but soon graduated to using an oxyacetylene torch to weld metal heads, which are probably the first welded metal sculptures ever made in the United States. A single work may consist of several materials, differentiated by varied patinas and polychromy.<ref name=MOMA/>\n[[File:Ancient Household.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early Smith: ''Ancient Household'' of 1945, bronze, in the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]\n\nIn 1940, the Smiths distanced themselves from the New York art scene and moved permanently to [[Bolton Landing, New York|Bolton Landing]] near [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] in [[Upstate New York]]. At Bolton Landing, he ran his studio like a factory, stocked with large amounts of raw material.<ref name=MOMA/> The artist would put his sculptures in what is referred to as an upper and lower field, and sometimes he would put them in rows, \"as if they were farm crops\".<ref name=Zimmer>William Zimmer (September 19, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/nyregion/art-the-sculptures-of-david-smith.html \"The Sculptures Of David Smith\"] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Smith worked as a welder for the [[American Locomotive Company]], [[Schenectady, NY]] assembling locomotives and M7 tanks. He taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].<ref name=theartstory>{{cite web|url=http://theartstory.org/artist-smith-david.htm|title=David Smith Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|author=|date=|website=theartstory.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===After 1945===\nAfter the war, with the additional skills that he had acquired, Smith released his pent-up energy and ideas in a burst of creation between 1945 and 1946. His output soared and he went about perfecting his own, very personal symbolism.\n\nTraditionally, metal sculpture meant bronze casts, which artisans produced using a mold made by the artist. Smith, however, made his sculptures from scratch, welding together pieces of steel and other metals with his torch, in much the same way that a painter applied paint to a canvas; his sculptures are almost always unique works.\n\nSmith, who often said, \"I belong with the painters\", made sculptures of subjects that had never before been shown in three dimensions. He made sculptural landscapes (e.g. ''Hudson River Landscape''), still life sculptures (e.g. ''Head as Still Life'') and even a sculpture of a page of writing (''The Letter''). Perhaps his most revolutionary concept was that the only difference between painting and sculpture was the addition of a third dimension; he declared that the sculptor's \"conception is as free as a that of the painter. His wealth of response is as great as his draftsmanship.\"<ref>''Everyday Art Quarterly'' 23 (1952)</ref>\n\nSmith was awarded the prestigious [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim]] Fellowship in 1950, which was renewed the following year. Freed from financial constraints, he made more and larger pieces, and for the first time was able to afford to make whole sculptures in stainless steel. He also began his practice of making sculptures in series, the first of which were the ''[[Agricola I|Agricolas]]'' of 1951-59. He steadily gained recognition, lecturing at universities and participating in symposia. He separated from Dehner in 1950, with divorce in 1952.<ref name=theartstory/> During his time as a visiting artist at [[Indiana University]], Bloomington, in 1955 and 1956, Smith produced the ''Forgings'', a series of eleven industrially forged steel sculptures.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (January 2, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/arts/design/david-smith-the-forgings-at-gagosian-gallery.html The Silent Totems of a Restless Quest] ''The New York Times''.</ref> To create the ''Forgings'', he cut, plugged, flattened, pinched and bent each steel bar, later polishing, rusting, painting, lacquering or waxing its surface.<ref name=Forgings>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/david-smith--november-08-2013 \"David Smith: The Forgings, October 29, 2013 - January 11, 2014\"] [[Gagosian Gallery]], New York.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s, Smith explored the technique of burnishing his stainless steel sculptures with a sander, a technique that would find its fullest expression in his ''[[Cubi]]'' series (1961\u201365). The scale of his works continued to increase - ''Tanktotem III'' of 1953 is 7' tall; ''Zig I'' from 1961 is 8'; and ''5 Ciarcs'' from 1963 is almost 13' tall. Finally, in the late 1950s Smith began using spray paint - then still a new medium - to create stenciled shapes out of negative space, in works closely tied to his late-career turn toward geometric planes and solids.<ref>[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/smith/highlights7.html David Smith: A Centennial, February 3 - May 14, 2006] [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York.</ref>\n\nHis family was also getting bigger; he remarried and had two daughters, Rebecca (born 1954) and Candida (born 1955). He named quite a few of his later works in honor of his children (e.g., ''Bec-Dida Day'', 1963, ''Rebecca Circle'', 1961, ''Hi Candida'', 1965).\n\nThe February 1960 issue of ''Arts'' magazine was devoted to Smith\u2019s work; later that year he had his first West Coast exhibition, a solo show at the [[Everett Ellin|Everett Ellin Gallery]] in Los Angeles. The following year he rejected a third-place award at the Carnegie International, saying \u201cthe awards system in our day is archaic.\u201d<ref>Cleve Gray, ''David Smith by David Smith'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1968), 40</ref>\n\nIn 1962, [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] invited Smith to make sculptures for the [[Festival dei Due Mondi]] in [[Spoleto]].<ref name=Zimmer/> Given open access to an abandoned steel mill and provided with a group of assistants, he produced an amazing 27 pieces in 30 days. Not yet finished with the themes he developed, he had tons of steel shipped from Italy to Bolton Landing, and over the next 18 months he made another 25 sculptures known as the ''[[Voltron (David Smith)|Voltri-Bolton]]'' series.\n\nHe died in a car crash near [[Bennington, Vermont]] on May 23, 1965.<ref name=Forgings/> He was 59 years old.\n\n===Paintings and drawings===\n[[File:Untitled (Green Linear Nude) by David Smith, c. 1964, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Untitled'' (''Green Linear Nude'') by David Smith, c. 1964, [[Honolulu Museum of Art]]]]\n\nSmith continued to paint and draw throughout his life. By 1953, he was producing between 300 and 400 drawings a year. His subjects encompassed the figure and landscape, as well as gestural, almost calligraphic marks made with egg yolk, Chinese ink and brushes and, in the late 1950s, the \"sprays\".<ref name=MOMA/> He usually signed his drawings with the ancient Greek letters delta and sigma, meant to stand for his initials.<ref>Christopher Knight (April 14, 2011), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/04/art-review-david-smith-drawing-space-at-margo-leavin-gallery.html#sthash.MX8tCaxg.dpuf Art review: 'David Smith: Drawing Space' at Margo Leavin Gallery] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> In the winter of 1963-64, he began a series known as the \"Last Nudes\". The paintings in this series are essentially drawings of nudes on canvas. He drew with [[enamel paint]] squeezed from syringes or bottles onto a canvas spread onto the floor.<ref>Honolulu Museum of Art, wall label, ''Untitled'' (''Green Linear Nude'') by David Smith, c. 1964, enamel on canvas, accession TCM.2007.1.5</ref> ''Untitled'' (''Green Linear Nude'') is painted in a metallic olive green enamel, and exemplifies the artist's late [[action painting]]s.\n\n===Major works===\n<!-- [[File:Smithdavid.jpg|200px|left|David Smith, ca. 1942]] EVIL DELETION BOT!-->\nSmith often worked in series.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=81812 David Smith, ''Cubi X'' (1963)] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref>  He is perhaps best known for the ''[[Cubi]]s'', which were among the last pieces he completed before his death. The sculptures in this series are made of stainless steel with a hand-brushed finish reminiscent of the gestural strokes of [[Abstract Expressionist]] painting. The ''[[Cubi]]'' works consist of arrangements of geometric shapes, which highlight his interest in balance and the contrast between positive and negative space.\n\nPrior to the ''[[Cubi]]s'', Smith gained widespread attention for his sculptures often described as \"drawings in space\".  He was originally trained as a painter and draftsman, and sculptures such as ''Hudson River Landscape'' (1950) and ''The Letter'' (both 1950) blurred the distinctions between sculpture and painting. These works make use of delicate tracery rather than solid form, with a two-dimensional appearance that contradicts the traditional idea of sculpture in the round.\n\nAs with many artists from the Modernist period, including [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]], much of Smith's early work was heavily influenced by [[Surrealism]]. Some of the best examples are seen in the ''Medals for Dishonor'', a series of bronze reliefs that speak out against the atrocities of war. Images from these medals are strange, nightmarish, and often violent. His own descriptions give a vivid picture of the medals and strongly express condemnation of these acts, such as this statement about ''Propaganda for War'' (1939\u201340):\n\n<blockquote>The rape of the mind by machines of death \u2013 the Hand of God points to atrocities. Atop the curly bull the red cross nurse blows the clarinet. The horse is dead in this bullfight arena \u2013 the bull is docile, can be ridden.<ref>''David Smith: Medals for Dishonor,'' (New York: Independent Curators Incorporated, 1996), 48.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Gallery of works==\n<gallery widths=\"110px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Saw Head (1933) by David Smith (5899787866).jpg|David Smith, ''Saw Head'', 1933; sculpture of iron and bronze, painted\nFile:Home of the welder Tate Modern L01025 n02.jpg|David Smith, ''Home of the welder'', 1945; steel sculpture, painted\nFile:David Smith02.jpg|David Smith, ''title unknown'', c. 1940s; steel sculpture, painted\nFile:Voltri XV.jpg|David Smith, ''[[Voltri XV]]'', 1962; steel sculpture\nFile:Cubi xii 6283224.JPG|David Smith, ''[[Cubi]] XII'', 1963; sculpture of stainless steel\nFile:Cubi XIII by David Smith.jpg|David Smith, ''[[Cubi]] XIII'', 1963-64; sculpture of stainless steel \n</gallery>\n\n==Legal controversy==\nIn the fall of 2013, Smith's estate became aware of a series of recent sculptures by the artist Lauren Clay, in which Clay appropriated the central geometrical motifs from Smith's ''Cubi''. Before Clay's sculptures were to be exhibited at the New Jersey sculpture park Grounds for Sculpture in October 2013, the estate contacted her and demanded an \"accounting\" of the work.<ref>http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/966834/david-smiths-estate-demands-house-arrest-for-a-young-artists</ref> Smith's estate accused Clay of copyright infringement and, at various points, demanded that she destroy her sculptures, or at least stop selling them. Smith's estate also threatened to sue Grounds for Sculpture if the sculptures were exhibited. However, Clay understood her works\u2014much smaller in scale and produced out of colored paper\u2014as critical commentary on Smith's iconic metal sculptures. As such, Clay felt that her sculptures constituted fair use under US copyright law. Eventually, the estate and Clay were able to reach an out-of-court settlement. Clay's exhibition at Grounds for Sculpture was initially canceled and then eventually rescheduled a year later. The estate agreed to allow Clay to exhibit and even sell the seven works, while Clay agreed that she would not add to the series or begin new works that referenced Smith's sculptures without mutual consent.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/arts/design/roberta-smiths-2013-art-highlights-and-some-concerns.html</ref> Clay also agreed not to make multiples of her works, and to furnish an exhibition artist statement, when possible, attributing Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/smith-estate-reveals-terms-of-agreement-with-brooklyn-artist/|title=Smith Estate Reveals Terms of Agreement with Brooklyn Artist - Art in America|author=|date=|website=artinamericamagazine.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\nSmith\u2019s first solo show of drawings and welded-steel sculpture was held at the [[Willard Gallery]] in New York in 1938.<ref name=Guggenheim/> In 1941, Smith sculptures were included in two traveling exhibitions organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and were shown at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s Annual exhibition in New York.\n\nSmith represented the United States in the 1951 [[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial]] and at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1954 and 1958. Six of his sculptures were included in an exhibition organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, that traveled to Paris, Zurich, D\u00fcsseldorf, Stockholm, Helsinki, and Oslo in 1953-54; he was given a retrospective exhibition by MoMA in 1957. In 1961, the MoMA organized an exhibition of fifty Smith sculptures that traveled throughout the United States until the spring of 1963. At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, \"David Smith: Cubes and Anarchy\" took a thematic look at the sculpture Smith produced between the Depression years and his death.<ref>Christopher Knight (April 5, 2011), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/04/art-review-david-smith-cubes-and-anarchy-at-los-angeles-county-museum-of-art.html Art review: 'David Smith: Cubes and Anarchy' at Los Angeles County Museum of Art] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>\n\n===Recent solo exhibitions (selection)===\n*February 12\u2013May 15, 2011: ''David Smith Invents'', [[The Phillips Collection]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]\n*April 3\u2013July 24, 2011: [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].
