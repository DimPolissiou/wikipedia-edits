The song was written by Brian Elliot with additional lyrics by Madonna, who produced it with [[Stephen Bray]]. The song also appears [[remix]]ed on the 1990 compilation album ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' and in its original form on the 2009 compilation album ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]''. The song's musical style combines pop and classical styling, and its lyrics deal with [[teenage pregnancy]] and the choices that come with it. It was based on teen gossip Elliot heard outside his recording studio.\n\nReleased as the album's second single in mid-1986, the song was a commercial success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]], shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped [[Blond|platinum blonde]] hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend.\n\nShortly after its release, the song caused heated discussions about its lyrical content. Women's organizations and others in the family planning field criticized Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive [[anti-abortion]] message. Madonna has performed \"Papa Don't Preach\" in five of her world tours, the latest being the [[Madame X Tour]] in 2019. The song also caused her first conflict with the [[Holy See|Vatican]], as she dedicated it to [[Pope John Paul II]], who urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts during the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] in 1987. In 2002, British singer [[Kelly Osbourne]] recorded a [[hard rock]] cover of the song which was included as a bonus track on her debut album ''[[Shut Up (Kelly Osbourne album)|Shut Up]]''.\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\nDuring the autumn of 1985, Madonna started writing and recording songs for her third studio album, ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]''. She brought back [[Stephen Bray|Steve Bray]] and hired a new producer, [[Patrick Leonard]], to help her on the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|pp=40\u201341}}</ref> The album's first track \"Papa Don't Preach\", was written by Brian Elliot, who described it as \"a love song, maybe framed a little bit differently\".<ref name=\"stpetersburg\">{{cite journal|issn=1563-6291|title='Papa Don't Preach' Stirs Teen Pregnancy Debate|date=September 5, 1986|journal=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|ref=harv}}</ref> The song is based on teen gossip he heard outside his recording studio, which has a large front window that doubles as a mirror where schoolgirls from the [[North Hollywood High School]] in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gossip Composite|date=September 18, 1986|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|publisher=[[A.

The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013D{{music|flat}}\u2013Cm\u2013D{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013Fm\u2013D{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013Fm, resembling a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] work. This is followed by the sound of [[dance music]], produced by a powerful beat from the instruments.<ref name=\"fouz\"/> Madonna's [[vocal range]] spans from F<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>,<ref name=\"musicsheet\"/> and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.<ref name=\"fouz\"/>\n\nThe lyrics show Madonna's interest in her [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who tells her father that she is pregnant and refuses to have an abortion or give up the baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling her to do.<ref>{{harvnb|Bielen|1999|p=151}}</ref> It is constructed in a [[verse-chorus form]], with a [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] before the third and final chorus. At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking him to talk to her as an adult, \"You should know by now that I'm not a baby\". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word \"Please\". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main [[Hook (music)|hook]] in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that [[Latin American music|Hispanic music]] had on Madonna's musical style.<ref name=\"fouz\"/>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[File:Madonna II A 13 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Madonna performing the track during the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] (1987).]]\n\"Papa Don't Preach\" was met with acclaim from music critics.

Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl to go out and get pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive.\n</blockquote>\n\nPeople who criticized the song's message included [[Ellen Goodman]], a national syndicated [[columnist]], who called the video \"a commercial for [[teenage pregnancy]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|Phelan|1993|p=347}}</ref> Feminist lawyer [[Gloria Allred]], the spokeswoman of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), angrily called for Madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting the opposite point of view.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p_theme=la&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF50FD8A0950E46&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Music-Rock News & Notes|date=September 12, 1986|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref> Alfred Moran, the executive director of [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood of New York City]], also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote [[birth control]] among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy.

Susan Carpenter-McMillan, the president of the California chapter of [[Feminists for Life]] (FFL) in the US, said that \"abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative.\"<ref name=\"newyorktimes\"/> [[Tipper Gore]], a founder of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single \"Dress You Up\",<ref>{{harvnb|Denisoff|1988|p=299}}</ref> and had led a campaign against explicit content in music,<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=18}}</ref> commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said \"the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud.\" <ref name=\"newyorktimes\"/>\n\nThe song's writer, Brian Elliot, commented about the debate: \"I just wanted to make this girl in the song a sympathetic character.

The song was written by Brian Elliot with additional lyrics by Madonna, who produced it with [[Stephen Bray]]. The song also appears [[remix]]ed on the 1990 compilation album ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' and in its original form on the 2009 compilation album ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]''. The song's musical style combines pop and classical styling, and its lyrics deal with [[teenage pregnancy]] and the choices that come with it. It was based on teen gossip Elliot heard outside his recording studio.\n\nReleased as the album's second single in mid-1986, the song was a commercial success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]], shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped [[Blond|platinum blonde]] hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend.\n\nShortly after its release, the song caused heated discussions about its lyrical content. Women's organizations and others in the family planning field criticized Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive [[anti-abortion]] message. Madonna has performed \"Papa Don't Preach\" in five of her world tours, the latest being the [[Madame X Tour]] in 2019. The song also caused her first conflict with the [[Holy See|Vatican]], as she dedicated it to [[Pope John Paul II]], who urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts during the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] in 1987. In 2002, British singer [[Kelly Osbourne]] recorded a [[hard rock]] cover of the song which was included as a bonus track on her debut album ''[[Shut Up (Kelly Osbourne album)|Shut Up]]''.\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\nDuring the autumn of 1985, Madonna started writing and recording songs for her third studio album, ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]''.

At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking him to talk to her as an adult, \"You should know by now that I'm not a baby\". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word \"Please\". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main [[Hook (music)|hook]] in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that [[Latin American music|Hispanic music]] had on Madonna's musical style.<ref name=\"fouz\"/>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[File:Madonna II A 13 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Madonna performing the track during the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] (1987).]]\n\"Papa Don't Preach\" was met with acclaim from music critics.

In July 1986, shortly after the release of the video for \"Papa Don't Preach\", Madonna commented on the controversy surrounding the song, to music critic [[Stephen Holden]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'':<ref name=\"metz\"/>\n<blockquote>\n\"Papa Don't Preach\" is a message song that everyone is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl to go out and get pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive.\n</blockquote>\n\nPeople who criticized the song's message included [[Ellen Goodman]], a national syndicated [[columnist]], who called the video \"a commercial for [[teenage pregnancy]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|Phelan|1993|p=347}}</ref> Feminist lawyer [[Gloria Allred]], the spokeswoman of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), angrily called for Madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting the opposite point of view.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p_theme=la&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF50FD8A0950E46&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Music-Rock News & Notes|date=September 12, 1986|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref> Alfred Moran, the executive director of [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood of New York City]], also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote [[birth control]] among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy.

Susan Carpenter-McMillan, the president of the California chapter of [[Feminists for Life]] (FFL) in the US, said that \"abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women. Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative.\"<ref name=\"newyorktimes\"/> [[Tipper Gore]], a founder of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single \"Dress You Up\",<ref>{{harvnb|Denisoff|1988|p=299}}</ref> and had led a campaign against explicit content in music,<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=18}}</ref> commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said \"the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, and anything that fosters that I applaud.\" <ref name=\"newyorktimes\"/>\n\nThe song's writer, Brian Elliot, commented about the debate: \"I just wanted to make this girl in the song a sympathetic character.

{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]]  took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]],  persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]], as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote that Hitler had some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism, but utter contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock wrote that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church. For Protestant clergy he felt only contempt... It was the 'great position' of the [Catholic] Church that he respected; towards its teaching he showed only the sharpest hostility.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref>  In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however.  In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed.  Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref>  Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult. On 23 January 1918 the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana'',<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313\u2013317</ref> in which he condemned the [[philosophy]] and practices of Communism. [[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals [[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]].<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref>\nThe pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]] and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the Papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref>  He{{Clarify|date=May 2019}} also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested. [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]{{incomprehensible_inline|date=May 2019}} Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref>  Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nAfter the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref>  Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became subject of numerous discussions.  In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce major results, aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which he claimed{{Clarify|post-text=(who claimed?)|date=May 2019}} was identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. Catholic Lithuania suffered especially in the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war, in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref>  The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947,  and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations.  Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]].  He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland.  In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end.

At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII writes again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam]]  salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Pope Pius addressed with ''[[Invicti athletae]]'' in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] through the Russians.  \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church\"  The Pope asks for endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, and even sacrifices in time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref>  The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]:\n{{quote|Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul, which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom.

Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref>  many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled.  Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,   [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican.  After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref>  The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy.  A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\",  this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times.  The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref>  Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him.  After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref>  The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref>  However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well.  In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref>  The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]]  took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions - notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive or resist, or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]],  persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]], as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote that Hitler had some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism, but utter contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock wrote that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

The Catholic Church officially condemned the Nazi theory of racism in Germany in 1937 with the [[encyclical]] \"[[Mit brennender Sorge]]\", signed by [[Pope Pius XI]].  Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".  It denounced the Nazi myth of \"blood and soil\", decried neopaganism of Nazism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the F\u00fchrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance.'

Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and of murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites: including religious leaders. In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: \"Poles may have only one master \u2013 a German.

The following summer, the [[A-B Aktion]] (''Extraordinary Pacification Operation'') further round up of several thousand Polish intelligentsia by the SS saw many priests shot in the General Government sector.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/>\n\nHistorically, the church had been a leading force in Polish nationalism against foreign domination, thus the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their terror campaigns. Treatment was at its most severe in the annexed regions, where churches were systematically closed and the majority of priests were either murdered, imprisoned or deported. Seminaries and convents were closed.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/>\n\n1,992 Polish clergy died in concentration camps.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/> Eighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs.<ref name=\"Craughwell\"/> Around 1.5 million Poles were transported to work as forced labor in Germany. Treated as racially inferior, they had to wear purple P's sewn into their clothing - sexual relations with Poles was punishable by death. Beyond the genocide of the Polish Jews, it is estimated that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians were killed during the German Occupation and the war.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/>\n\n====Elsewhere====\nDuring the [[Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]], the Dutch Bishops condemned the Nazi abduction of Jews. The Nazis retaliated with a series of repressive measures.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf</ref> Many Catholics were involved in strikes and protests against the treatment of Jews, and the Nazis offered to exempt converts and Jews married to non-Jews if protests ceased. The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref>  In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however.  In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.  The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]]  situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy, and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed.  Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref>  Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult. On 23 January 1918 the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana'',<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313\u2013317</ref> in which he condemned the [[philosophy]] and practices of Communism. [[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals [[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]].<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref>\nThe pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]] and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the Papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref>  He{{Clarify|date=May 2019}} also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested. [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]{{incomprehensible_inline|date=May 2019}} Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref>  Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nAfter the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref>  Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became subject of numerous discussions.  In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce major results, aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which he claimed{{Clarify|post-text=(who claimed?)|date=May 2019}} was identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. Catholic Lithuania suffered especially in the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war, in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref>  The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947,  and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations.  Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]].  He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland.  In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests are incarcerated, all seminaries of [[religious institute]]s closed<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the Cardinal, Communist authorities support patriotic priests, who desire a separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII writes again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam]]  salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Pope Pius addressed with ''[[Invicti athletae]]'' in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] through the Russians.  \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church\"  The Pope asks for endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, and even sacrifices in time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref>  The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]:\n{{quote|Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul, which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom. Keep Catholic faith and unity.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 34,  in AAS 1957, 321</ref>}}\n\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\n''They can take away your freedom, but they cannot tear the Catholic faith from your hearts. They can turn you into martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors''.<ref>AAS, XXXVII, 1945, 252</ref> In 1945, the [[Czechoslovakian]] government expelled its [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Germans|German]] populations from Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of [[Catholics]] in the country. After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref>  Attempts were made, to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refusing to participate were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" assumed all functions of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained only gradually ground in the country.  But in the following five years, the Church lost three thousand and three-hundred [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]] and [[newspapers]]. 11.500 [[Religious]] were asked to leave their convents and monasteries and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]]. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After coup of the communist party in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/>\nPope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and received him in the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946.  \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]].  His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]]... The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania,  Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref>  many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled.  Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,   [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican.  After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref>  The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy.  A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\",  this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times.  The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref>  Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him.  After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref>  The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref>  However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well.  In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref>  The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

It travels through the states of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], serving several large cities on the U.S. West Coast, including [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Seattle]]. It is currently the only continuous Interstate highway to touch both the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] and the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]]. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, Interstate 5 continues to [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]] as [[Mexico Federal Highway 1]]. Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to [[Vancouver]] as [[British Columbia Highway 99]].\n\nInterstate 5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the Interstate Highway System, but was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century. The Pacific Highway auto trail was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and was later incorporated into [[U.S. Route 99]] (US 99) in 1926. Interstate 5 largely follows the route of US 99, with the exception of a portion in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California. The freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1978, including expressway sections of US 99 that were built earlier to bypass various towns along the route.\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=\"fhwa\" />}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in California|CA]]\n|{{convert|796.53|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Oregon|OR]]\n|{{convert|308.14|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Washington|WA]]\n|{{convert|276.62|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|Total\n|{{convert|1381.29|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===California===\n[[File:Interstate5newhallpass.JPG|thumb|right|I-5 in the [[Newhall Pass Interchange]] where it intersects with [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|I-210]] and [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] near [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] ]]\n{{main|Interstate 5 in California}}\nThe southernmost point of I-5 is at the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] at the [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] border crossing, one of the busiest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-005.html |title=Busiest border crossing |publisher=Interstate-guide.com |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date=March 2014}}</ref> Beginning at the border in San Ysidro, which is part of the city of [[San Diego]], as the [[John J. Montgomery Freeway]], I-5 goes through the suburbs of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reaching downtown San Diego. It then parallels the Pacific coastline, going through the northern suburbs of San Diego, bisecting the [[University of California, San Diego]] campus, and passing the I-805 merge (where it becomes the widest Interstate in the United States for a short stretch), before passing through several [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] coastal suburbs and then through {{convert|18|mi|km}} of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] Base [[Camp Pendleton, California|Camp Pendleton]] in northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. Here I-5 is also known as the San Diego Freeway.\n\nAt [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], I-5 turns inland and heads due north through [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]] to the [[El Toro Y]] interchange in southeastern [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. I-5 becomes the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] as it runs southeast to northwest, passing through major cities and suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Southern Los Angeles]] counties. Southern Californians often refer to it as \"the 5\" or as the Santa Ana Freeway in the Los Angeles area. From this point, the San Diego Freeway continues northward as I-405.\n\nWhen the freeway reaches the [[East Los Angeles Interchange]] {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], I-5 becomes the [[Golden State Freeway]]. The route continues through the [[San Fernando Valley]] and then crosses the [[Newhall Pass]] through the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] into the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. The interchange with [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14) is unusual in that truck traffic is separated into its own lanes for both the mainline of the freeway and the transition ramps to and from SR&nbsp;14. For about a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} stretch between the Santa Clarita Valley and [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides, with the southbound lanes running to the east of the northbound ones. At that point, the Golden State Freeway rises sharply to the north through [[Ridge Route#Features|the Grapevine]] to eventually reach the second-highest point of its entire length, the [[Tejon Pass]] (elevation {{convert|4144|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Through the [[Tehachapi Mountains]]. [[Path 26]] [[electric power transmission|power lines]] generally follow the freeway along this stretch. The freeway then descends sharply for {{convert|12|mi|km}} at Tejon Pass to around {{convert|1500|ft|m}} at Grapevine near the southernmost point of the [[San Joaquin Valley]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} south from where [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]] splits away from it in [[Wheeler Ridge, California|Wheeler Ridge]].\n\n[[File:I-5 near Shasta.jpg|thumb|left|I-5 south approaching [[Weed, California|Weed]] and [[Mount Shasta|Mt. Shasta]]]]\n\nFrom SR&nbsp;99 to south of [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], I-5 skirts along the far more remote western edge of the great [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and thus here is removed from population centers such as [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]; other state highways provide these connections. This part of I-5 is known as the West Side Freeway, and is a major connector between the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Southern California. [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] splits from I-5 at a point south of Tracy as the West Side Freeway Scenic Byway, the last stretch of the West Side Freeway\u2014providing a loop-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. East of Tracy, I-5 intersects with I-205, another freeway that links I-5 to the Bay Area and passes through Tracy. After passing Tracy, I-5 heads north through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] before turning west to [[Woodland, California|Woodland]]. At Woodland, the Interstate heads northwest again towards [[Dunnigan, California|Dunnigan]], where it converges with [[Interstate 505|I-505]].\n\nFrom Dunnigan, I-5 skirts north along the western edge of the [[Sacramento Valley]] to [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]]. I-5 then enters the [[Shasta Cascade]] region, passing through [[Redding, California|Redding]] and [[Shasta Lake]] before climbing up to near the foot of [[Mount Shasta]]. The interstate then travels to [[Weed, California|Weed]] and [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] before reaching the Oregon border.\n\n===Oregon===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Oregon}}\n[[File:I5inPortlandNight.jpg|right|thumb|I-5 running adjacent to the [[Willamette River]] and passes by the [[Moda Center]], and [[Oregon Convention Center]] in Downtown Portland]]\nAbout {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} north of the California border, the highway crosses {{convert|4310|ft|m}} [[Siskiyou Summit]], the highest point on I-5, and then drops down into the [[Rogue Valley]] through Oregon's southern mountains and towns such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]] and [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]]. Turning north across three passes to the Umpqua Valley and through [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], the mountains tend to turn into hills, and as it reaches Cottage Grove, the road enters the [[Willamette Valley|Willamette River Valley]]. At [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] the highway intersects [[Oregon Route 126|I-105]], a short spur route into Downtown [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. Some city highways intersect on I-5 in the Eugene Metro. The Interstate then heads almost due north, skirting [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] and [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], passing through [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], and crossing through [[Woodburn, Oregon|Woodburn]]. There were plans to build a spur, called [[Interstate 305 (Oregon)|I-305]], into Salem. I-5 covers {{convert|308|mi|km}} in [[Oregon]].\n\nJust north of Salem, between mile markers 259 and 260 just short of mile marker 260, signs in the median and on both shoulders mark the place where the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] crosses I-5. It reads \"45th Parallel half way between the Equator and the North Pole\".\n\nThe highway then tracks a little to the northeast, and [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]] splits off south of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metro area. From here I-5 passes through Tualatin and Tigard along former [[U.S. Route 99W (Oregon)|U.S. Route 99W]] (US&nbsp;99W) before hitting the southern terminus of [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]] and the [[Marquam Bridge]]. Also planned was a spur in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] off I-405, called [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|I-505]], but it was never built and has been removed from city plans. A stub of I-505 exists as a long exit ramp to [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]].\n\nAfter crossing the Willamette River on the [[Marquam Bridge]], I-5 has junctions at the western end of [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] and the northern end of I-405. It then continues through the northern parts of the city of Portland, and crosses into Washington via the [[Interstate Bridge]].\n\n===Washington===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Washington}}\n[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|I-5 passing through downtown Seattle]]\nThe highway continues over the [[Columbia River]] and drops down into the city of [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]]. About {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} into the state, it reaches the northern terminus of [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]], which is on the eastern edge of the Portland\u2013Vancouver metropolitan area. It then tracks north by northwest through [[Woodland, Washington|Woodland]] to [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] and [[Longview, Washington|Longview]], at which point it ceases to parallel a large bend of the Columbia River. Continuing north between the [[Willapa Hills]] and the Cascade foothills, the freeway eventually reaches [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], where it bends sharply east. The highway passes through the northern end of [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] (formerly [[Fort Lewis]] and [[McChord Field|McChord Air Force Base]]) and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], where it bends sharply north again to reach [[Seattle]]. The [[Ship Canal Bridge]] carries it over [[Portage Bay]] in Seattle. The freeway continues north out of the Seattle\u2013Tacoma\u2013[[Everett, Washington|Everett]] metro area, crosses the floodplains of three rivers, through the Skagit Valley and the Mount Vernon\u2013Burlington Metropolitan Area to the northern city of [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], to arrive at the [[Peace Arch]] Canada\u2013US border crossing between [[Blaine, Washington]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia]].

By the 1820s, trappers from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of today's I-5 to move between today's Washington State and California. During the second half of the 19th century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail.<ref name=\"siskiyou\" /> By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, notably the [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific Highway]]. The Pacific Highway ran from [[British Columbia]] to [[San Diego]], California, and was the immediate predecessor of much of [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]]. The route of US&nbsp;99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of today's I-5.\n\nA major deviation from the old US&nbsp;99 route is the Westside Freeway portion of I-5 in California's Central Valley. To provide a faster and more direct north\u2013south route through the state, the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway (which was re-designated as part of [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]]).<ref name=\"cahighways_5\"/>\nThis re-route through California's Central Valley was the last section of I-5 to be constructed, with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near [[Stockton, California]], on October 12, 1979.

It travels through the states of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], serving several large cities on the U.S. West Coast, including [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Seattle]]. It is currently the only continuous Interstate highway to touch both the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] and the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]]. Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, Interstate 5 continues to [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]] as [[Mexico Federal Highway 1]]. Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to [[Vancouver]] as [[British Columbia Highway 99]].\n\nInterstate 5 was originally created in 1956 as part of the Interstate Highway System, but was predated by several auto trails and highways built in the early 20th century. The Pacific Highway auto trail was built in the 1910s and 1920s by the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and was later incorporated into [[U.S. Route 99]] (US 99) in 1926. Interstate 5 largely follows the route of US 99, with the exception of a portion in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California. The freeway was built in segments between 1956 and 1978, including expressway sections of US 99 that were built earlier to bypass various towns along the route.\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=\"fhwa\" />}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in California|CA]]\n|{{convert|796.53|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Oregon|OR]]\n|{{convert|308.14|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|[[Interstate 5 in Washington|WA]]\n|{{convert|276.62|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|-\n|Total\n|{{convert|1381.29|mi|km|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===California===\n[[File:Interstate5newhallpass.JPG|thumb|right|I-5 in the [[Newhall Pass Interchange]] where it intersects with [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|I-210]] and [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] near [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] ]]\n{{main|Interstate 5 in California}}\nThe southernmost point of I-5 is at the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]] at the [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] border crossing, one of the busiest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-005.html |title=Busiest border crossing |publisher=Interstate-guide.com |date= |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date=March 2014}}</ref> Beginning at the border in San Ysidro, which is part of the city of [[San Diego]], as the [[John J. Montgomery Freeway]], I-5 goes through the suburbs of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reaching downtown San Diego. It then parallels the Pacific coastline, going through the northern suburbs of San Diego, bisecting the [[University of California, San Diego]] campus, and passing the I-805 merge (where it becomes the widest Interstate in the United States for a short stretch), before passing through several [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] coastal suburbs and then through {{convert|18|mi|km}} of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] Base [[Camp Pendleton, California|Camp Pendleton]] in northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. Here I-5 is also known as the San Diego Freeway.\n\nAt [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], I-5 turns inland and heads due north through [[Mission Viejo, California|Mission Viejo]] to the [[El Toro Y]] interchange in southeastern [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. I-5 becomes the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] as it runs southeast to northwest, passing through major cities and suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Southern Los Angeles]] counties. Southern Californians often refer to it as \"the 5\" or as the Santa Ana Freeway in the Los Angeles area. From this point, the San Diego Freeway continues northward as I-405.\n\nWhen the freeway reaches the [[East Los Angeles Interchange]] {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], I-5 becomes the [[Golden State Freeway]]. The route continues through the [[San Fernando Valley]] and then crosses the [[Newhall Pass]] through the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] into the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. The interchange with [[California State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14) is unusual in that truck traffic is separated into its own lanes for both the mainline of the freeway and the transition ramps to and from SR&nbsp;14. For about a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} stretch between the Santa Clarita Valley and [[Pyramid Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Pyramid Lake]], the northbound and southbound lanes separate and cross sides, with the southbound lanes running to the east of the northbound ones. At that point, the Golden State Freeway rises sharply to the north through [[Ridge Route#Features|the Grapevine]] to eventually reach the second-highest point of its entire length, the [[Tejon Pass]] (elevation {{convert|4144|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Through the [[Tehachapi Mountains]]. [[Path 26]] [[electric power transmission|power lines]] generally follow the freeway along this stretch. The freeway then descends sharply for {{convert|12|mi|km}} at Tejon Pass to around {{convert|1500|ft|m}} at Grapevine near the southernmost point of the [[San Joaquin Valley]], approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} south from where [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]] splits away from it in [[Wheeler Ridge, California|Wheeler Ridge]].\n\n[[File:I-5 near Shasta.jpg|thumb|left|I-5 south approaching [[Weed, California|Weed]] and [[Mount Shasta|Mt. Shasta]]]]\n\nFrom SR&nbsp;99 to south of [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], I-5 skirts along the far more remote western edge of the great [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and thus here is removed from population centers such as [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]; other state highways provide these connections. This part of I-5 is known as the West Side Freeway, and is a major connector between the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Southern California. [[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] splits from I-5 at a point south of Tracy as the West Side Freeway Scenic Byway, the last stretch of the West Side Freeway\u2014providing a loop-route connection to the San Francisco Bay Area. East of Tracy, I-5 intersects with I-205, another freeway that links I-5 to the Bay Area and passes through Tracy. After passing Tracy, I-5 heads north through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] before turning west to [[Woodland, California|Woodland]]. At Woodland, the Interstate heads northwest again towards [[Dunnigan, California|Dunnigan]], where it converges with [[Interstate 505|I-505]].\n\nFrom Dunnigan, I-5 skirts north along the western edge of the [[Sacramento Valley]] to [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]]. I-5 then enters the [[Shasta Cascade]] region, passing through [[Redding, California|Redding]] and [[Shasta Lake]] before climbing up to near the foot of [[Mount Shasta]]. The interstate then travels to [[Weed, California|Weed]] and [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] before reaching the Oregon border.\n\n===Oregon===\n{{main|Interstate 5 in Oregon}}\n[[File:I5inPortlandNight.jpg|right|thumb|I-5 running adjacent to the [[Willamette River]] and passes by the [[Moda Center]], and [[Oregon Convention Center]] in Downtown Portland]]\nAbout {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} north of the California border, the highway crosses {{convert|4310|ft|m}} [[Siskiyou Summit]], the highest point on I-5, and then drops down into the [[Rogue Valley]] through Oregon's southern mountains and towns such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]] and [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]]. Turning north across three passes to the Umpqua Valley and through [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], the mountains tend to turn into hills, and as it reaches Cottage Grove, the road enters the [[Willamette Valley|Willamette River Valley]]. At [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] the highway intersects [[Oregon Route 126|I-105]], a short spur route into Downtown [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. Some city highways intersect on I-5 in the Eugene Metro. The Interstate then heads almost due north, skirting [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] and [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], passing through [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], and crossing through [[Woodburn, Oregon|Woodburn]]. There were plans to build a spur, called [[Interstate 305 (Oregon)|I-305]], into Salem. I-5 covers {{convert|308|mi|km}} in [[Oregon]].\n\nJust north of Salem, between mile markers 259 and 260 just short of mile marker 260, signs in the median and on both shoulders mark the place where the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] crosses I-5. It reads \"45th Parallel half way between the Equator and the North Pole\".\n\nThe highway then tracks a little to the northeast, and [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]] splits off south of the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metro area. From here I-5 passes through Tualatin and Tigard along former [[U.S. Route 99W (Oregon)|U.S. Route 99W]] (US&nbsp;99W) before hitting the southern terminus of [[Interstate 405 (Oregon)|I-405]] and the [[Marquam Bridge]]. Also planned was a spur in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] off I-405, called [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|I-505]], but it was never built and has been removed from city plans. A stub of I-505 exists as a long exit ramp to [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]].\n\nAfter crossing the Willamette River on the [[Marquam Bridge]], I-5 has junctions at the western end of [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] and the northern end of I-405.

About {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} into the state, it reaches the northern terminus of [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]], which is on the eastern edge of the Portland\u2013Vancouver metropolitan area. It then tracks north by northwest through [[Woodland, Washington|Woodland]] to [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] and [[Longview, Washington|Longview]], at which point it ceases to parallel a large bend of the Columbia River. Continuing north between the [[Willapa Hills]] and the Cascade foothills, the freeway eventually reaches [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], where it bends sharply east. The highway passes through the northern end of [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] (formerly [[Fort Lewis]] and [[McChord Field|McChord Air Force Base]]) and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], where it bends sharply north again to reach [[Seattle]]. The [[Ship Canal Bridge]] carries it over [[Portage Bay]] in Seattle. The freeway continues north out of the Seattle\u2013Tacoma\u2013[[Everett, Washington|Everett]] metro area, crosses the floodplains of three rivers, through the Skagit Valley and the Mount Vernon\u2013Burlington Metropolitan Area to the northern city of [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], to arrive at the [[Peace Arch]] Canada\u2013US border crossing between [[Blaine, Washington]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia]].

By the 1820s, trappers from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of today's I-5 to move between today's Washington State and California. During the second half of the 19th century, mule trains, stagecoaches, and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroad also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail.<ref name=\"siskiyou\" /> By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the path of the Siskiyou Trail, notably the [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific Highway]]. The Pacific Highway ran from [[British Columbia]] to [[San Diego]], California, and was the immediate predecessor of much of [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]]. The route of US&nbsp;99 was in turn used as a basis for much of the route of today's I-5.\n\nA major deviation from the old US&nbsp;99 route is the Westside Freeway portion of I-5 in California's Central Valley. To provide a faster and more direct north\u2013south route through the state, the decision was made to build a new freeway to the west and bypass [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], and the rest of population centers in the area instead of upgrading the existing highway (which was re-designated as part of [[California State Route 99|SR&nbsp;99]]).<ref name=\"cahighways_5\"/>\nThis re-route through California's Central Valley was the last section of I-5 to be constructed, with the final segment dedicated and opened to traffic near [[Stockton, California]], on October 12, 1979.

He was the brother of [[Soyarabai]] and the maternal uncle of [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> . Soyarabai issued orders to [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] and [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle|Moropant]] to leave Raigad with a force of 5,000 to arrest Sambhaji at Panhala. Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala. Sambhaji was delighted at the arrival of Hambirrao on his side<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=196-208}}</ref> . Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant. Some of Shivaji's ministers such as Annaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand and other conspirators were executed on charges of conspiracy and treason.<ref name=\"Mehta2005\"/>{{rp|48}}<ref name=\"SharmaL\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b2004\">{{cite book|author1=Sunita Sharma|author2=K\u0332h\u0332ud\u0101 Bak\u0332h\u0332sh Oriyan\u1e6dal Pablik L\u0101\u02bcibrer\u012b|title=Veil, sceptre, and quill: profiles of eminent women, 16th- 18th centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2kaAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=30 September 2012|year=2004|publisher=Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library|page=139}} \u2013 ''By June 1680 three months after Shivaji's death Rajaram was made a prisoner in the fort of [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\"</ref> Sambhaji arrived at Raigad and put Soyarabai and Rajaram under house arrest. Soyarabai was guilty for her actions and commited suicide by poisoning herself. Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens. In order to accomplish the task, Kakar Khan destroyed more than 100 temples surrounding Burhanpur and conducting torture, plunder, killing, cutting of women's ears and men's eyes for the wealth.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur.

Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala.

Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.
