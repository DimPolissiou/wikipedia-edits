It was also notable for its advanced graphics and [[ambidextrous]] layout. The Lynx competed with the [[Game Boy]] (released two months earlier), as well as the [[Game Gear]] and [[TurboExpress]], both released the following year. It was discontinued in 1995.\n\n==History==\nThe Lynx system was originally developed by [[Epyx]] as the '''Handy Game'''. In 1986, two former [[Amiga]] designers, [[R. J. Mical]] and [[Dave Needle]], had been asked by former manager at Amiga, [[David Shannon Morse|David Morse]], if they could come up with a design for a portable gaming system.<ref name= \"EGM1989\"/><ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Steven |date= |title=Third Time's a Charm (They Hope) |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/3do_pr.html |journal=Wired |location=United States |publisher=Conde Nast |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}</ref> Morse now worked at Epyx, a game software company that had a recent string of hit games. Morse's son had asked him if he could make a portable gaming system, prompting a meeting with Mical and Needle to discuss the idea. Morse convinced Mical and Needle to develop the idea and they were hired by Epyx to be a part of the design team.<ref name=\"EGM1989\"/> Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and was completed in 1987.<ref name=\"retrogamer#4\">{{cite journal |author=Peter Latimer |date=July 2005 |title=Atari Lynx |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=4 |pages=Pages 24\u201331 |issn=1742-3155 }}</ref> Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1989.<ref name=\"EGM1989\">{{cite journal|last=Jermaine |first=John |date=November 1989 |title=Lynx, an interview with the men behind the machine |url=http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |location=United States |publisher=Sendai Publications |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916114505/http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |archivedate=September 16, 2014 }}</ref> Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners. [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], and other companies declined, but Atari and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari would handle production and marketing, while Epyx would handle software development. Epyx declared bankruptcy by the end of the year, and Atari essentially owned the entire project; both Atari and others, however, had to purchase Amigas from Atari archrival [[Commodore Business Machines|Commodore]] to develop Lynx software.<ref name=\"maher20161222\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/12/a-time-of-endings-part-2-epyx/ |title=A Time of Endings, Part 2: Epyx |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |website=The Digital Antiquarian |publication-date=2016-12-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Handy was designed to run games from the cartridge format, and the game data must be copied from ROM to RAM before it can be used.

The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called \"tabbed\" or \"ridged\", used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the \"curved lip\" style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.php?SystemID=LYNX Atari Lynx] cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.</ref>\n\nIn May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (3\u20134 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was slightly smaller and was backed up by significantly more games.\n\nRetailers such as [[Game (retailer)|Game]] and [[Toys R Us]] continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-1990s on the back of the [[Atari Jaguar]] launch, helped by magazines such as ''Ultimate Future Games'' who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.\n\n===Lynx II===\n[[File:Atari-Lynx-II-Handheld-Angled.jpg|right|thumb|The Atari Lynx II, smaller and lighter than the original]]\nDuring 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales. In July 1991, Atari introduced the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari as the \"Lynx II\") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.\n\n===Decline===\nIn 1993, Atari started shifting its focus away from the Lynx in order to prepare for the launch of the Jaguar. A few games were released during this time, including ''Battlezone 2000''. Support for the Lynx would not be formally discontinued until 1995.\n\nIn 1995, after the launch of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] drastically caused the [[Failure#Commercial failures|commercial failure]] of the Jaguar, Atari terminated all internal game and hardware development and, later in 1996, agreed to [[Reverse takeover|reverse merge]] with [[JT Storage|JTS, Inc.]], thus the [[Atari|Atari brand]] would leave the video game market for quite some time until [[Hasbro Interactive]] resurrected it in 1998.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-goes-to-hasbro/1100-2462915/ | title=Atari goes to Hasbro | website=GameSpot | date=April 28, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Todd's Adventures in Slime World cover art (Atari Lynx).jpg|thumb|right|150px]]\nThe Atari Lynx's innovative features include being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 15 other units via its Comlynx system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). Comlynx was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye).<ref name=\"retrogramer164\">{{cite journal |title=Todd's Adventures in Slime World |journal=Retro Gamer Magazine |volume= |issue=164 |pages=74 }}</ref> This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release. According to Peter Engelbrite, when players walked through the beam, the link would be interrupted. The maximum stable connection allowed was eight players.<ref name=\"retrogramer164\" /> Engelbrite also developed the first recordable eight-player co-op game, and the only eight-player game for the Atari Lynx, ''[[Todd's Adventures in Slime World]]'', using the Comlynx system. Each Lynx needed a copy of the game, and one cable could connect two machines. The cables could be connected into a chain.\n\n{{quote box \n| quote=\"The leading-edge display was the most expensive component, so the colour choice was one of economy.

Featuring a 4096 color palette and integrated math and graphics co-processors (including a [[blitter]] unit), its [[pseudo-3D]] color graphics display was said to be the key defining feature in the system's competition against Nintendo's monochromatic Game Boy.

It was also notable for its advanced graphics and [[ambidextrous]] layout. The Lynx competed with the [[Game Boy]] (released two months earlier), as well as the [[Game Gear]] and [[TurboExpress]], both released the following year. It was discontinued in 1995.\n\n==History==\nThe Lynx system was originally developed by [[Epyx]] as the '''Handy Game'''. In 1986, two former [[Amiga]] designers, [[R. J. Mical]] and [[Dave Needle]], had been asked by former manager at Amiga, David Morse, if they could come up with a design for a portable gaming system.<ref name= \"EGM1989\"/><ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Steven |date= |title=Third Time's a Charm (They Hope) |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/3do_pr.html |journal=Wired |location=United States |publisher=Conde Nast |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}</ref> Morse now worked at Epyx, a game software company that had a recent string of hit games. Morse's son had asked him if he could make a portable gaming system, prompting a meeting with Mical and Needle to discuss the idea. Morse convinced Mical and Needle to develop the idea and they were hired by Epyx to be a part of the design team.<ref name=\"EGM1989\"/> Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and was completed in 1987.<ref name=\"retrogamer#4\">{{cite journal |author=Peter Latimer |date=July 2005 |title=Atari Lynx |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=4 |pages=Pages 24\u201331 |issn=1742-3155 }}</ref> Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1989.<ref name=\"EGM1989\">{{cite journal|last=Jermaine |first=John |date=November 1989 |title=Lynx, an interview with the men behind the machine |url=http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |location=United States |publisher=Sendai Publications |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916114505/http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |archivedate=September 16, 2014 }}</ref> Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners. [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], and other companies declined, but Atari and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari would handle production and marketing, while Epyx would handle software development. Epyx declared bankruptcy by the end of the year, and Atari essentially owned the entire project; both Atari and others, however, had to purchase Amigas from Atari archrival [[Commodore Business Machines|Commodore]] to develop Lynx software.<ref name=\"maher20161222\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.filfre.net/2016/12/a-time-of-endings-part-2-epyx/ |title=A Time of Endings, Part 2: Epyx |last=Maher |first=Jimmy |website=The Digital Antiquarian |publication-date=2016-12-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Handy was designed to run games from the cartridge format, and the game data must be copied from ROM to RAM before it can be used.

The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called \"tabbed\" or \"ridged\", used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the \"curved lip\" style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.<ref>[http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.php?SystemID=LYNX Atari Lynx] cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.</ref>\n\nIn May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (3\u20134 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was slightly smaller and was backed up by significantly more games.\n\nRetailers such as [[Game (retailer)|Game]] and [[Toys R Us]] continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-1990s on the back of the [[Atari Jaguar]] launch, helped by magazines such as ''Ultimate Future Games'' who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.\n\n===Lynx II===\n[[File:Atari-Lynx-II-Handheld-Angled.jpg|right|thumb|The Atari Lynx II, smaller and lighter than the original]]\nDuring 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales. In July 1991, Atari introduced the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari as the \"Lynx II\") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.\n\n===Decline===\nIn 1993, Atari started shifting its focus away from the Lynx in order to prepare for the launch of the Jaguar. A few games were released during this time, including ''Battlezone 2000''. Support for the Lynx would not be formally discontinued until 1995.\n\nIn 1995, after the launch of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] drastically caused the [[Failure#Commercial failures|commercial failure]] of the Jaguar, Atari terminated all internal game and hardware development and, later in 1996, agreed to [[Reverse takeover|reverse merge]] with [[JT Storage|JTS, Inc.]], thus the [[Atari|Atari brand]] would leave the video game market for quite some time until [[Hasbro Interactive]] resurrected it in 1998.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-goes-to-hasbro/1100-2462915/ | title=Atari goes to Hasbro | website=GameSpot | date=April 28, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Todd's Adventures in Slime World cover art (Atari Lynx).jpg|thumb|right|150px]]\nThe Atari Lynx's innovative features include being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 15 other units via its Comlynx system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). Comlynx was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye).<ref name=\"retrogramer164\">{{cite journal |title=Todd's Adventures in Slime World |journal=Retro Gamer Magazine |volume= |issue=164 |pages=74 }}</ref> This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release. According to Peter Engelbrite, when players walked through the beam, the link would be interrupted. The maximum stable connection allowed was eight players.<ref name=\"retrogramer164\" /> Engelbrite also developed the first recordable eight-player co-op game, and the only eight-player game for the Atari Lynx, ''[[Todd's Adventures in Slime World]]'', using the Comlynx system. Each Lynx needed a copy of the game, and one cable could connect two machines. The cables could be connected into a chain.\n\n{{quote box \n| quote=\"The leading-edge display was the most expensive component, so the colour choice was one of economy.

Featuring a 4096 color palette and integrated math and graphics co-processors (including a [[blitter]] unit), its [[pseudo-3D]] color graphics display was said to be the key defining feature in the system's competition against Nintendo's monochromatic Game Boy.

The disruption is caused by the blocking of \n\n, an [[enzyme]] that catalyzes the breakdown of m, a [[neurotransmitter]].\n\nPoisoning by a nerve agent leads to constriction of [[pupil]]s, profuse [[salivation]], [[convulsion]]s, and involuntary [[urination]] and [[defecation]], with the first symptoms appearing in seconds after exposure. Death by [[asphyxiation]] or [[cardiac arrest]] may follow in minutes due to the loss of the body's control over [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] and other muscles. Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or [[aerosol]]ized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the [[respiratory system]]. Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a [[respirator]].\n\nNerve agents are generally colorless to [[Amber (color)|amber-colored]], tasteless liquids that may evaporate to a [[gas]]. Agents [[sarin]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] are odorless; [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] has a slightly fruity odor and [[soman]] has a slight [[camphor]] odor.<ref name=\"ATSDR\">{{cite web | url = https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=523&tid=93 | title = Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Nerve Agents (GA, GB, GD, VX) | work = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180125190018/https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=523&tid=93 | archive-date = 2018-01-25 | url-status= live | access-date = 2018-03-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Biological effects==\nNerve agents attack the [[nervous system]].

Once the impulse is sent, the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]] immediately breaks down the acetylcholine in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.\n\nNerve agents disrupt the nervous system by inhibiting the function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase by forming a [[covalent bond]] with its [[active site]], where acetylcholine would normally be broken down (undergo [[hydrolysis]]). Acetylcholine thus builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. This same action also occurs at the gland and organ levels, resulting in uncontrolled drooling, tearing of the eyes (lacrimation) and excess production of mucus from the nose (rhinorrhea).\n\nThe reaction product of the most important nerve agents, including soman, sarin, tabun and VX, with [[acetylcholinesterase]] were solved by the U.S. Army using [[X-ray crystallography]] in the 1990s.<ref name=pmid10353814>{{cite journal | vauthors = Millard CB, Kryger G, Ordentlich A, Greenblatt HM, Harel M, Raves ML, Segall Y, Barak D, Shafferman A, Silman I, Sussman JL | title = Crystal structures of aged phosphonylated acetylcholinesterase: nerve agent reaction products at the atomic level | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 22 | pages = 7032\u20139 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10353814 | doi = 10.1021/bi982678l }}</ref><ref name=\"Millard et al 1999\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja992704i |title=Reaction Products of Acetylcholinesterase and VX Reveal a Mobile Histidine in the Catalytic Triad |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=121 |issue=42 |pages=9883\u20134 |year=1999 |last1=Millard |first1=Charles B |last2=Koellner |first2=Gertraud |last3=Ordentlich |first3=Arie |last4=Shafferman |first4=Avigdor |last5=Silman |first5=Israel |last6=Sussman |first6=Joel L | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> The reaction products have been confirmed subsequently using different sources of acetylcholinesterase and the closely related target enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase.

All of the compounds in this class were discovered and synthesized during or prior to [[World War II]], led by [[Gerhard Schrader]] (later under the employment of [[IG Farben]]).\n\nThis series is the first and oldest family of nerve agents. The first nerve agent ever synthesised was GA ([[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]]) in 1936. GB ([[sarin]]) was discovered next in 1939, followed by GD ([[soman]]) in 1944, and finally the more obscure GF ([[cyclosarin]]) in 1949. GB was the only G agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, [[aerial bombs]], and [[artillery shell]]s.<ref name = \"FM 3-8\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===V-series===\n[[File:VX-S-enantiomer-3D-balls.png|thumb|Chemical form of the nerve agent [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]].]]\n[[File:Nerve agent V series.svg|thumb|400px|The V series of nerve agents.]]\nThe ''V-series'' is the second family of nerve agents and contains five well known members: [[VE (nerve agent)|VE]], [[VG (nerve agent)|VG]], [[VM (nerve agent)|VM]], [[VR (nerve agent)|VR]], and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], along with several more obscure analogues.<ref name='red\":4\"' />\n\nThe most studied agent in this family, [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], was invented in the 1950s at [[Porton Down]] in the United Kingdom. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). Like Schrader, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name [[VG (nerve agent)|Amiton]]. It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed and some of the more toxic materials had been sent to the British Armed Forces research facility at [[Porton Down]] for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents (depending on the source, the V stands for Victory, Venomous, or Viscous). The best known of these is probably [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], with VR (\"Russian V-gas\") coming a close second (Amiton is largely forgotten as VG). All of the V-agents are persistent agents, meaning that these agents do not degrade or wash away easily and can therefore remain on clothes and other surfaces for long periods. In use, this allows the V-agents to be used to blanket terrain to guide or curtail the movement of enemy ground forces. The consistency of these agents is similar to oil; as a result, the contact hazard for V-agents is primarily \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 dermal.

Some insecticides such as [[demeton]], [[dimefox]] and [[paraoxon]] are sufficiently toxic to humans that they have been withdrawn from agricultural use, and were at one stage investigated for potential military applications.

Since 1934, Schrader had been working in a laboratory in [[Leverkusen]] to develop new types of [[insecticide]]s for [[IG Farben]]. While working toward his goal of improved insecticide, Schrader experimented with numerous compounds, eventually leading to the preparation of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]].\n\nIn experiments, tabun was extremely potent against insects: as little as 5 [[Parts per million|ppm]] of tabun killed all the [[aphids|leaf lice]] he used in his initial experiment. In January 1937, Schrader observed the effects of nerve agents on human beings first-hand when a drop of tabun spilled onto a lab bench. Within minutes he and his laboratory assistant began to experience [[miosis]] (constriction of the pupils of the eyes), dizziness and severe shortness of breath. It took them three weeks to recover fully.\n\nIn 1935 the [[Nazism|Nazi]] government had passed a decree that required all inventions of possible military significance to be reported to the [[Ministry of the Reichswehr|Ministry of War]], so in May 1937 Schrader sent a sample of tabun to the [[chemical warfare]] (CW) section of the [[Waffenamt|Army Weapons Office]] in [[Berlin-Spandau]]. Schrader was summoned to the Wehrmacht chemical lab in Berlin to give a demonstration, after which Schrader's [[patent]] application and all related research was classified as secret. Colonel R\u00fcdiger, head of the CW section, ordered the construction of new laboratories for the further investigation of tabun and other organophosphate compounds and Schrader soon moved to a new laboratory at [[Wuppertal]]-[[Elberfeld]] in the [[Ruhr valley]] to continue his research in secret throughout [[World War II]]. The compound was initially codenamed Le-100 and later Trilon-83.\n\n[[Sarin]] was discovered by Schrader and his team in 1938 and named in honor of its discoverers: [[Gerhard Schrader|'''S'''chrader]], [[Otto Ambros|'''A'''mbros]], Gerhard '''R'''itter, and von der L'''in'''de.<ref name=\"Evans2008\">\n{{cite book\n | author= Richard J.

It was found to be more than ten times as potent as tabun.\n\n[[Soman]] was discovered by [[Richard Kuhn]] in 1944 as he worked with the existing compounds; the name is derived from either the [[Greek language|Greek]] 'to sleep' or the [[Latin]] 'to bludgeon'. It was codenamed T-300.\n\n[[Cyclosarin]] was also discovered during WWII but the details were lost and it was rediscovered in 1949.\n\nThe G-series naming system was created by the United States when it uncovered the German activities, labeling tabun as GA (German Agent A), sarin as GB and soman as GD. Ethyl sarin was tagged GE and cyclosarin as GF.\n\n===During World War II===\nIn 1939, a pilot [[factory|plant]] for tabun production was set up at [[Munster Training Area#Munsterlager|Munster-Lager]], on [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]] near the German Army proving grounds at {{ill|Raubkammer|de}}. In January 1940, construction began on a secret plant, code named \"[[Hochwerk]]\" (''High factory''), for the production of tabun at ''Dyhernfurth an der Oder'' (now [[Brzeg Dolny]] in [[Poland]]), on the [[Oder River]] {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Breslau]] (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) in [[Silesia]].\n\nThe plant was large, covering an area of {{convert|2.4|by|0.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} and was completely self-contained, synthesizing all intermediates as well as the final product, tabun. The factory even had an underground plant for filling munitions, which were then stored at Krappitz (now [[Krapkowice]]) in Upper Silesia. The plant was operated by {{ill|Anorgana GmbH|de|Anorgana}}, a subsidiary of [[IG Farben]], as were all other [[chemical weapon agent]] production plants in Germany at the time.\n\nBecause of the plant's deep secrecy and the difficult nature of the production process, it took from January 1940 until June 1942 for the plant to become fully operational. Many of tabun's chemical precursors were so corrosive that reaction chambers not lined with quartz or silver soon became useless. Tabun itself was so hazardous that the final processes had to be performed while enclosed in double glass-lined chambers with a stream of pressurized air circulating between the walls.\n\nThree thousand German nationals were employed at Hochwerk, all equipped with [[respirators]] and [[clothing]] constructed of a poly-layered rubber/cloth/rubber sandwich that was destroyed after the tenth wearing. Despite all precautions, there were over 300 accidents before production even began and at least ten workers died during the two and a half years of operation. Some incidents cited in ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare'' are as follows:<ref>{{cite book|title=A higher form of killing : the secret history of chemical and biological warfare|last=Harris|first=Robert|name-list-format=vanc|date=2002|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|others=Paxman, Jeremy, 1950-|isbn=9780812966534|location=New York|oclc=49356080|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780812966534}}</ref>\n*Four pipe fitters had liquid tabun drain onto them and died before their rubber suits could be removed.\n*A worker had two liters of tabun pour down the neck of his rubber suit. He died within two minutes.\n*Seven workers were hit in the face with a stream of tabun of such force that the liquid was forced behind their respirators. Only two survived despite [[resuscitation]] measures.\n\n{{Citation needed span|text=The plant produced between 10 000 and 30 000 tons of tabun before its capture by the Soviet Army|date=March 2018|reason=}} and moved, probably to [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Corona: America's first satellite program | date = 1995 | publisher = [Morgan James]| last= Ruffner | first = Kevin Conley | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-9758570-4-5|location=[New York]|pages=185|oclc=772235331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Suspect CW Agent Production Plants, Dzerzhinsk, USSR, Changes Since 1962|last=|first=|publisher=CIA/NPIC|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940 the [[German Army Weapons Office]] ordered the mass production of sarin for wartime use. A number of pilot plants were built and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of [[World War II]]. Estimates for total sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]] to 10 [[ton]]s.\n\nDuring that time, German [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] believed that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] also knew of these compounds, assuming that because these compounds were not discussed in the Allies' scientific journals information about them was being suppressed. Though sarin, tabun and soman were incorporated into [[artillery]] shells, the German government ultimately decided not to use nerve agents against Allied targets. The Allies did not learn of these agents until shells filled with them were captured towards the end of the war. German forces used chemical warfare against partisans during the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula]] in 1942, but did not use any nerve agent.<ref>Bellamy, Chris (2008).

Hitler asked Ambros, \"What is the other side doing about poison gas?\" Ambros explained that the enemy, because of its greater access to [[ethylene]], probably had a greater capacity to produce [[mustard gas]] than Germany did. Hitler interrupted to explain that he was not referring to traditional poison gases: \"I understand that the countries with petroleum are in a position to make more [mustard gas], but Germany has a special gas, tabun. In this we have a monopoly in Germany.\" He specifically wanted to know whether the enemy had access to such a gas and what it was doing in this area. To Hitler's disappointment Ambros replied, \"I have justified reasons to assume that tabun, too, is known abroad. I know that tabun was publicized as early as 1902, that Sarin was patented and that these substances appeared in patents. \" (...)Ambros was informing Hitler of an extraordinary fact about one of Germany's most secret weapons. The essential nature of tabun and sarin had already been disclosed in the technical journals as far back as 1902 and [[IG Farben|I.G.]] had [[patent]]ed both products in 1937 and 1938. Ambros then warned Hitler that if Germany used tabun, it must face the possibility that the Allies could produce this gas in much larger quantities. Upon receiving this discouraging report, Hitler abruptly left the meeting.

The disruption is caused by the blocking of [[acetylcholinesterase]], an [[enzyme]] that catalyzes the breakdown of [[acetylcholine]], a [[neurotransmitter]].\n\nPoisoning by a nerve agent leads to constriction of [[pupil]]s, profuse [[salivation]], [[convulsion]]s, and involuntary [[urination]] and [[defecation]], with the first symptoms appearing in seconds after exposure. Death by [[asphyxiation]] or [[cardiac arrest]] may follow in minutes due to the loss of the body's control over [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] and other muscles. Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or [[aerosol]]ized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the [[respiratory system]]. Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a [[respirator]].\n\nNerve agents are generally colorless to [[Amber (color)|amber-colored]], tasteless liquids that may evaporate to a [[gas]]. Agents [[sarin]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] are odorless; [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] has a slightly fruity odor and [[soman]] has a slight [[camphor]] odor.<ref name=\"ATSDR\">{{cite web | url = https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=523&tid=93 | title = Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Nerve Agents (GA, GB, GD, VX) | work = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180125190018/https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=523&tid=93 | archive-date = 2018-01-25 | url-status= live | access-date = 2018-03-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Biological effects==\nNerve agents attack the [[nervous system]].

Once the impulse is sent, the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]] immediately breaks down the acetylcholine in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.\n\nNerve agents disrupt the nervous system by inhibiting the function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase by forming a [[covalent bond]] with its [[active site]], where acetylcholine would normally be broken down (undergo [[hydrolysis]]). Acetylcholine thus builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. This same action also occurs at the gland and organ levels, resulting in uncontrolled drooling, tearing of the eyes (lacrimation) and excess production of mucus from the nose (rhinorrhea).\n\nThe reaction product of the most important nerve agents, including soman, sarin, tabun and VX, with [[acetylcholinesterase]] were solved by the U.S. Army using [[X-ray crystallography]] in the 1990s.<ref name=pmid10353814>{{cite journal | vauthors = Millard CB, Kryger G, Ordentlich A, Greenblatt HM, Harel M, Raves ML, Segall Y, Barak D, Shafferman A, Silman I, Sussman JL | title = Crystal structures of aged phosphonylated acetylcholinesterase: nerve agent reaction products at the atomic level | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 22 | pages = 7032\u20139 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10353814 | doi = 10.1021/bi982678l }}</ref><ref name=\"Millard et al 1999\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja992704i |title=Reaction Products of Acetylcholinesterase and VX Reveal a Mobile Histidine in the Catalytic Triad |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=121 |issue=42 |pages=9883\u20134 |year=1999 |last1=Millard |first1=Charles B |last2=Koellner |first2=Gertraud |last3=Ordentlich |first3=Arie |last4=Shafferman |first4=Avigdor |last5=Silman |first5=Israel |last6=Sussman |first6=Joel L | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> The reaction products have been confirmed subsequently using different sources of acetylcholinesterase and the closely related target enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase.

All of the compounds in this class were discovered and synthesized during or prior to [[World War II]], led by [[Gerhard Schrader]] (later under the employment of [[IG Farben]]).\n\nThis series is the first and oldest family of nerve agents. The first nerve agent ever synthesised was GA ([[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]]) in 1936. GB ([[sarin]]) was discovered next in 1939, followed by GD ([[soman]]) in 1944, and finally the more obscure GF ([[cyclosarin]]) in 1949. GB was the only G agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, [[aerial bombs]], and [[artillery shell]]s.<ref name = \"FM 3-8\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===V-series===\n[[File:VX-S-enantiomer-3D-balls.png|thumb|Chemical form of the nerve agent [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]].]]\n[[File:Nerve agent V series.svg|thumb|400px|The V series of nerve agents.]]\nThe ''V-series'' is the second family of nerve agents and contains five well known members: [[VE (nerve agent)|VE]], [[VG (nerve agent)|VG]], [[VM (nerve agent)|VM]], [[VR (nerve agent)|VR]], and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], along with several more obscure analogues.<ref name='red\":4\"' />\n\nThe most studied agent in this family, [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], was invented in the 1950s at [[Porton Down]] in the United Kingdom. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). Like Schrader, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name [[VG (nerve agent)|Amiton]]. It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed and some of the more toxic materials had been sent to the British Armed Forces research facility at [[Porton Down]] for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents (depending on the source, the V stands for Victory, Venomous, or Viscous). The best known of these is probably [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], with VR (\"Russian V-gas\") coming a close second (Amiton is largely forgotten as VG). All of the V-agents are persistent agents, meaning that these agents do not degrade or wash away easily and can therefore remain on clothes and other surfaces for long periods. In use, this allows the V-agents to be used to blanket terrain to guide or curtail the movement of enemy ground forces. The consistency of these agents is similar to oil; as a result, the contact hazard for V-agents is primarily \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 dermal. VX was the only V-series agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, [[artillery shell]]s, airplane spray tanks, and [[landmine]]s.<ref name=\"FM 3-8\">''FM 3-8 Chemical Reference handbook''; US Army; 1967</ref><ref>[http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003677713 \"U.S. Army Destroys Entire Stockpile of VX Spray Tanks\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206182557/http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003677713 |date=2009-02-06 }}, U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, December 26, 2007, accessed January 4, 2007</ref>\n\n===Novichok agents===\n{{Main|Novichok agent}}\nThe Novichok (Russian: {{Lang|ru|\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043e\u0301\u043a}}, \"newcomer\") agents, a series of [[organophosphate]] compounds, were developed in the [[Soviet Union]] and in Russia from the mid-1960s to the 1990s.

The metabolism of [[insect]]s is sufficiently different from [[mammal]]s that these compounds have little effect on humans and other mammals at proper doses, but there is considerable concern about the effects of long-term exposure to these chemicals by farm workers and animals alike. At high enough doses, [[acute (medical)|acute]] toxicity and death can occur through the same mechanism as other nerve agents. Some insecticides such as [[demeton]], [[dimefox]] and [[paraoxon]] are sufficiently toxic to humans that they have been withdrawn from agricultural use, and were at one stage investigated for potential military applications. Paraoxon was allegedly used as an assassination weapon by the apartheid South African government as part of [[Project Coast]]. Organophosphate [[pesticide poisoning]] is a major cause of disability in many developing countries and is often the preferred method of suicide.<ref name=pmid15550429>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckley NA, Roberts D, Eddleston M | title = Overcoming apathy in research on organophosphate poisoning | journal = BMJ | volume = 329 | issue = 7476 | pages = 1231\u20133 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15550429 | pmc = 529372 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7476.1231 }}</ref>\n\n==Methods of spreading==\nMany methods exist for spreading nerve agents such as:<ref name=\":3\" />\n*uncontrolled [[aerosol]] munitions\n*smoke generation\n*explosive dissemination\n*[[aerosol#Generation and applications|atomizers]], [[humidifier]]s and [[fogger]]s\nThe method chosen will depend on the physical properties of the nerve agent(s) used, the nature of the target, and the achievable level of sophistication.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book | title=A laboratory history of chemical warfare agents : a book |  last = Ledgard | first = Jared B. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|publisher=Jared Ledgard?]|others=Mazal Holocaust Collection |isbn=9780615136455|edition=2nd |location= |oclc=171111408}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== Discovery ===\n\nThis first class of nerve agents, the G-series, was accidentally discovered in Germany on December 23, 1936, by a research team headed by [[Gerhard Schrader]] working for [[IG Farben]]. Since 1934, Schrader had been working in a laboratory in [[Leverkusen]] to develop new types of [[insecticide]]s for [[IG Farben]]. While working toward his goal of improved insecticide, Schrader experimented with numerous compounds, eventually leading to the preparation of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]].\n\nIn experiments, tabun was extremely potent against insects: as little as 5 [[Parts per million|ppm]] of tabun killed all the [[aphids|leaf lice]] he used in his initial experiment. In January 1937, Schrader observed the effects of nerve agents on human beings first-hand when a drop of tabun spilled onto a lab bench. Within minutes he and his laboratory assistant began to experience [[miosis]] (constriction of the pupils of the eyes), dizziness and severe shortness of breath. It took them three weeks to recover fully.\n\nIn 1935 the [[Nazism|Nazi]] government had passed a decree that required all inventions of possible military significance to be reported to the [[Ministry of the Reichswehr|Ministry of War]], so in May 1937 Schrader sent a sample of tabun to the [[chemical warfare]] (CW) section of the [[Waffenamt|Army Weapons Office]] in [[Berlin-Spandau]]. Schrader was summoned to the Wehrmacht chemical lab in Berlin to give a demonstration, after which Schrader's [[patent]] application and all related research was classified as secret. Colonel R\u00fcdiger, head of the CW section, ordered the construction of new laboratories for the further investigation of tabun and other organophosphate compounds and Schrader soon moved to a new laboratory at [[Wuppertal]]-[[Elberfeld]] in the [[Ruhr valley]] to continue his research in secret throughout [[World War II]]. The compound was initially codenamed Le-100 and later Trilon-83.\n\n[[Sarin]] was discovered by Schrader and his team in 1938 and named in honor of its discoverers: [[Gerhard Schrader|'''S'''chrader]], [[Otto Ambros|'''A'''mbros]], Gerhard '''R'''itter, and von der L'''in'''de.<ref name=\"Evans2008\">\n{{cite book\n | author= Richard J.

It was found to be more than ten times as potent as tabun.\n\n[[Soman]] was discovered by [[Richard Kuhn]] in 1944 as he worked with the existing compounds; the name is derived from either the [[Greek language|Greek]] 'to sleep' or the [[Latin]] 'to bludgeon'. It was codenamed T-300.\n\n[[Cyclosarin]] was also discovered during WWII but the details were lost and it was rediscovered in 1949.\n\nThe G-series naming system was created by the United States when it uncovered the German activities, labeling tabun as GA (German Agent A), sarin as GB and soman as GD. Ethyl sarin was tagged GE and cyclosarin as GF.\n\n===During World War II===\nIn 1939, a pilot [[factory|plant]] for tabun production was set up at [[Munster Training Area#Munsterlager|Munster-Lager]], on [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]] near the German Army proving grounds at {{ill|Raubkammer|de}}. In January 1940, construction began on a secret plant, code named \"[[Hochwerk]]\" (''High factory''), for the production of tabun at ''Dyhernfurth an der Oder'' (now [[Brzeg Dolny]] in [[Poland]]), on the [[Oder River]] {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Breslau]] (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) in [[Silesia]].\n\nThe plant was large, covering an area of {{convert|2.4|by|0.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} and was completely self-contained, synthesizing all intermediates as well as the final product, tabun. The factory even had an underground plant for filling munitions, which were then stored at Krappitz (now [[Krapkowice]]) in Upper Silesia. The plant was operated by {{ill|Anorgana GmbH|de|Anorgana}}, a subsidiary of [[IG Farben]], as were all other [[chemical weapon agent]] production plants in Germany at the time.\n\nBecause of the plant's deep secrecy and the difficult nature of the production process, it took from January 1940 until June 1942 for the plant to become fully operational. Many of tabun's chemical precursors were so corrosive that reaction chambers not lined with quartz or silver soon became useless. Tabun itself was so hazardous that the final processes had to be performed while enclosed in double glass-lined chambers with a stream of pressurized air circulating between the walls.\n\nThree thousand German nationals were employed at Hochwerk, all equipped with [[respirators]] and [[clothing]] constructed of a poly-layered rubber/cloth/rubber sandwich that was destroyed after the tenth wearing. Despite all precautions, there were over 300 accidents before production even began and at least ten workers died during the two and a half years of operation. Some incidents cited in ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare'' are as follows:<ref>{{cite book|title=A higher form of killing : the secret history of chemical and biological warfare|last=Harris|first=Robert|name-list-format=vanc|date=2002|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|others=Paxman, Jeremy, 1950-|isbn=9780812966534|location=New York|oclc=49356080|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780812966534}}</ref>\n*Four pipe fitters had liquid tabun drain onto them and died before their rubber suits could be removed.\n*A worker had two liters of tabun pour down the neck of his rubber suit. He died within two minutes.\n*Seven workers were hit in the face with a stream of tabun of such force that the liquid was forced behind their respirators. Only two survived despite [[resuscitation]] measures.\n\n{{Citation needed span|text=The plant produced between 10 000 and 30 000 tons of tabun before its capture by the Soviet Army|date=March 2018|reason=}} and moved, probably to [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Corona: America's first satellite program | date = 1995 | publisher = [Morgan James]| last= Ruffner | first = Kevin Conley | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-9758570-4-5|location=[New York]|pages=185|oclc=772235331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Suspect CW Agent Production Plants, Dzerzhinsk, USSR, Changes Since 1962|last=|first=|publisher=CIA/NPIC|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940 the [[German Army Weapons Office]] ordered the mass production of sarin for wartime use. A number of pilot plants were built and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of [[World War II]]. Estimates for total sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]] to 10 [[ton]]s.\n\nDuring that time, German [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] believed that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] also knew of these compounds, assuming that because these compounds were not discussed in the Allies' scientific journals information about them was being suppressed. Though sarin, tabun and soman were incorporated into [[artillery]] shells, the German government ultimately decided not to use nerve agents against Allied targets. The Allies did not learn of these agents until shells filled with them were captured towards the end of the war. German forces used chemical warfare against partisans during the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula]] in 1942, but did not use any nerve agent.<ref>Bellamy, Chris (2008).

Hitler asked Ambros, \"What is the other side doing about poison gas?\" Ambros explained that the enemy, because of its greater access to [[ethylene]], probably had a greater capacity to produce [[mustard gas]] than Germany did. Hitler interrupted to explain that he was not referring to traditional poison gases: \"I understand that the countries with petroleum are in a position to make more [mustard gas], but Germany has a special gas, tabun. In this we have a monopoly in Germany.\" He specifically wanted to know whether the enemy had access to such a gas and what it was doing in this area. To Hitler's disappointment Ambros replied, \"I have justified reasons to assume that tabun, too, is known abroad. I know that tabun was publicized as early as 1902, that Sarin was patented and that these substances appeared in patents. \" (...)Ambros was informing Hitler of an extraordinary fact about one of Germany's most secret weapons. The essential nature of tabun and sarin had already been disclosed in the technical journals as far back as 1902 and [[IG Farben|I.G.]] had [[patent]]ed both products in 1937 and 1938. Ambros then warned Hitler that if Germany used tabun, it must face the possibility that the Allies could produce this gas in much larger quantities. Upon receiving this discouraging report, Hitler abruptly left the meeting.
