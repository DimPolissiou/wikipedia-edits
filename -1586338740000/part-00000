The road forms part of the [[international E-road network|international E-road]], [[European route E18]].\n\nThere is a Community Council at Kirkcowan.<ref>http://www.kirkcowan.com/community-council/</ref>\n\nKirkcowan is on the medieval pilgrim route to [[Whithorn Priory]], seat of Christianity in Scotland.\n\n== The Village ==\nThe village of Kirkcowan is on the road to Wigtown, and situated between the Rivers Tarff and Bladnoch.<ref>http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/newtonstewart/kirkcowan/index.html</ref>\n\nBecause the village is situated on the main Stranraer to Carlisle bus route, and between the two rivers, it attracts many fishermen, hikers and also cyclists since it is on the Machars Yellow cycle route.\n\nThe church, erected in 1829, under the patronage of the [[Clan Agnew|Agnew family]], is a substantial structure with a tower. A congregation of [[Seceders]] assembled for public worship in an old barn.<ref>A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, Samuel Lewis, 1846.</ref>\n\nKirkcowan Village has a Post Office; Nursery and Primary School; a village hall, garage/petrol station (Kirkcowan Service station), pub/hotel(Craighlaw Arms) and a photography studio run by wedding and portrait photographer Dan Baillie.\n\nKirkcowan also has a growing Beavers, Cubs and Scouts Troop, with a multitude of beautiful places to venture, trails to follow and areas to explore.<ref>http://www.trailbehind.com/node/4509794/#get_quad/-4.619150161743164/54.91130708498108/14</ref>\n\n==Places of interest==\n'''Glendarroch Loch''', situated in the vicinity of the village of Kirkcowan and easily accessible from the A75 Euroroute, is one of the region's coarse fishing gems. The loch is a small, gin clear estate loch which holds a large head of roach, rudd and perch. Carp have been stocked in recent years and are regularly caught whilst tench and bream up to 3lb are also present.<ref>http://www.gofishing.co.uk/Angling-Times/Section/wheretofish/Scotland2/Dumfries-and-Galloway/Glendarroch-Loch-Coarse-Fishing/</ref>\n\n'''Loch Maberry Castle''' Crannog. A fortified island surrounded by the remains of a massive drystone wall, 1.8m to 2.1m thick and about 2.1m high, enclosing an area approx 34.1m by 25.9m which has been subdivided and contains buildings all except the largest being of dry-stone. Entrances on east and west and the island has been connected by causeway to both the loch shore and the island to the north, which shows evidence of having been surrounded at the water's edge by a low wall of large boulders occasionally set on end. A causeway from the south-western end of this island links with that between the southern island and the shore.<ref>http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/62444/details/loch+maberry+castle/</ref><ref>http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/loch-maberry-castle</ref>\n\nThe [[River Bladnoch]] rises at '''Loch Maberry''' in the parish of Kirkcowan, through which it runs south to Polbae.\n\nOn its journey south it is joined by Reoch Burn as it passes through '''Carseriggan Moor'''.\n\nContinuing its journey it passes '''Isle-na-Gower''' and becomes a border between the afforested land at Hopeless Howe and the Ring of Barfad.\n\nShortly after this it is met and joined by '''Black Burn'''. At this point the river is bordered on its east side by Barnley Plantation.\n\nCrossing the River Bladnoch at the stepping stones is a single-track road which links Mark of Shennanton with '''Little Eldrig'''.\n\nShortly after this point the river widens briefly at Broad Wheel. Continuing on its journey southwards it is next forded by Shennanton Bridge where the A75 crosses it.\n\nNext we come to Linn Wood and the waterfall at '''Linn of Barhoise'''. The word \"linn\" refers to the pool rather than the waterfall.  (see photo)\n\nThe river then moves on past Barhoise Farm to '''Barhoise Mill'''.\n\nIn 1684, according to Symson, this area had a salmon fishery with nets on both the Bladnoch and the Tarf.\n\nAt the '''Mill of Barhoise''', the Laird of '''Craichlaw''' had fishing rights. Barhoise Mill is a T-shaped two storey construction of granite, whinstone and slate, which is falling into a dilapidated state. The mill was driven by a wheel which was situated at the side of the building. Of this wheel only the wooden axle remains. The datestone above the door reads 1827, but this mill is most certainly a reconstruction of a much earlier one, perhaps connected with the Old Place of Glaisnick, a one-time nearby residence of the powerful Gordon family of '''Craichlaw'''.  The main road from Kirkcowan to Wigtown and from Kirkcowan to Minnigaff via Glaisnick crossed the river just south of this mill. There are still stepping stones at the fording place east of Ring Farm.\n\n'''Eldrig Fell, Wood Cairn'''. a large circular cairn 18m. in diameter and 2.2m. high.<ref>http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/62293/details/wood+cairn+eldrig+fell/</ref>\n\nNear '''Shennanton''' there is a cairn marked on OS mapping, shown in the centre of the photo in front of the tall trees (see photo).\n\n'''Boreland Mote''' or Motte is on OS mapping and sits at the side of the B733.  It is about 20 feet high and 100-120feet around the base (see photo).<ref>http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/62838/details/boreland+mote/</ref>\n\n'''Mindork or Mondork Castle''', Wood Hill.

He married Janet Baillie, and was ancestor of the Gordons of Craighlaw.\n\nThe [[Kirkcowan railway station|railway station]] of the [[Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway]] closed in 1965.\n\nA mill was erected in 1822 for the manufacture of woollen cloths,  blankets, plaidings, flannels, and plain and pilot cloths, for the dyeing and dressing of which the soft water of the Tarff was well adapted.\n\n==Notable People==\n*[[Thomas Hugh Milroy]] [[FRSE]] born here in 1869\n\n==Listed Buildings==\n[[List of listed buildings in Kirkcowan, Dumfries and Galloway]]\n\n==Gallery (click on photos)==\n<gallery>\nImage:Village street, Kirkcowan.jpg|Street scene in Kirkcowan.\nFile:Kirkcowan Church - geograph.org.uk - 902089.jpg|Kirkcowan Church.\nFile:Old church, Kirkcowan - geograph.org.uk - 578150.jpg|Old church, Kirkcowan.\nFile:The Burn at Craighlaw - geograph.org.uk - 1132158.jpg|Craighlaw Castle.\nFile:Bridge to island, Craichlaw Loch - geograph.org.uk - 434610.jpg|Bridge to island, Craichlaw Loch.\nFile:The Linn of Barhoise - geograph.org.uk - 803094.jpg|The Linn of Barhoise Waterfall on the River Bladnoch.\nFile:Wood Cairn - geograph.org.uk - 771789.jpg|Eldrig Fell, large Wood Cairn.\nFile:White Cairn - geograph.org.uk - 447250.jpg|White Cairn.\nFile:Rough pasture near Mindork Farm - geograph.org.uk - 163205.jpg|near Mindork or Mondork Castle ruin.\nFile:Shennanton.jpg|Shennanton.

The road forms part of the [[international E-road network|international E-road]], [[European route E18]].\n\nThere is a Community Council at Kirkcowan.<ref>http://www.kirkcowan.com/community-council/</ref>\n\nKirkcowan is on the medieval pilgrim route to [[Whithorn Priory]], seat of Christianity in Scotland.\n\n== The Village ==\nThe village of Kirkcowan is on the road to Wigtown, and situated between the Rivers Tarff and Bladnoch.<ref>http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/newtonstewart/kirkcowan/index.html</ref>\n\nBecause the village is situated on the main Stranraer to Carlisle bus route, and between the two rivers, it attracts many fishermen, hikers and also cyclists since it is on the Machars Yellow cycle route.\n\nThe church, erected in 1829, under the patronage of the [[Clan Agnew|Agnew family]], is a substantial structure with a tower. A congregation of [[Seceders]] assembled for public worship in an old barn.<ref>A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, Samuel Lewis, 1846.</ref>\n\nKirkcowan Village has a Post Office; Nursery and Primary School; a village hall, garage/petrol station (Kirkcowan Service station), pub/hotel(Craighlaw Arms) and a photography studio run by wedding and portrait photographer Dan Baillie.\n\nKirkcowan also has a growing Beavers, Cubs and Scouts Troop, with a multitude of beautiful places to venture, trails to follow and areas to explore.<ref>http://www.trailbehind.com/node/4509794/#get_quad/-4.619150161743164/54.91130708498108/14</ref>\n\n==Places of interest==\n'''Glendarroch Loch''', situated in the vicinity of the village of Kirkcowan and easily accessible from the A75 Euroroute, is one of the region's coarse fishing gems. The loch is a small, gin clear estate loch which holds a large head of roach, rudd and perch. Carp have been stocked in recent years and are regularly caught whilst tench and bream up to 3lb are also present.<ref>http://www.gofishing.co.uk/Angling-Times/Section/wheretofish/Scotland2/Dumfries-and-Galloway/Glendarroch-Loch-Coarse-Fishing/</ref>\n\n'''Loch Maberry Castle''' Crannog. A fortified island surrounded by the remains of a massive drystone wall, 1.8m to 2.1m thick and about 2.1m high, enclosing an area approx 34.1m by 25.9m which has been subdivided and contains buildings all except the largest being of dry-stone. Entrances on east and west and the island has been connected by causeway to both the loch shore and the island to the north, which shows evidence of having been surrounded at the water's edge by a low wall of large boulders occasionally set on end. A causeway from the south-western end of this island links with that between the southern island and the shore.<ref>http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/62444/details/loch+maberry+castle/</ref><ref>http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/loch-maberry-castle</ref>\n\nThe [[River Bladnoch]] rises at '''Loch Maberry''' in the parish of Kirkcowan, through which it runs south to Polbae.\n\nOn its journey south it is joined by Reoch Burn as it passes through '''Carseriggan Moor'''.\n\nContinuing its journey it passes '''Isle-na-Gower''' and becomes a border between the afforested land at Hopeless Howe and the Ring of Barfad.\n\nShortly after this it is met and joined by '''Black Burn'''. At this point the river is bordered on its east side by Barnley Plantation.\n\nCrossing the River Bladnoch at the stepping stones is a single-track road which links Mark of Shennanton with '''Little Eldrig'''.\n\nShortly after this point the river widens briefly at Broad Wheel. Continuing on its journey southwards it is next forded by Shennanton Bridge where the A75 crosses it.\n\nNext we come to Linn Wood and the waterfall at '''Linn of Barhoise'''. The word \"linn\" refers to the pool rather than the waterfall.  (see photo)\n\nThe river then moves on past Barhoise Farm to '''Barhoise Mill'''.\n\nIn 1684, according to Symson, this area had a salmon fishery with nets on both the Bladnoch and the Tarf.\n\nAt the '''Mill of Barhoise''', the Laird of '''Craichlaw''' had fishing rights. Barhoise Mill is a T-shaped two storey construction of granite, whinstone and slate, which is falling into a dilapidated state. The mill was driven by a wheel which was situated at the side of the building. Of this wheel only the wooden axle remains. The datestone above the door reads 1827, but this mill is most certainly a reconstruction of a much earlier one, perhaps connected with the Old Place of Glaisnick, a one-time nearby residence of the powerful Gordon family of '''Craichlaw'''.  The main road from Kirkcowan to Wigtown and from Kirkcowan to Minnigaff via Glaisnick crossed the river just south of this mill. There are still stepping stones at the fording place east of Ring Farm.\n\n'''Eldrig Fell, Wood Cairn'''. a large circular cairn 18m. in diameter and 2.2m. high.<ref>http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/62293/details/wood+cairn+eldrig+fell/</ref>\n\nNear '''Shennanton''' there is a cairn marked on OS mapping, shown in the centre of the photo in front of the tall trees (see photo).\n\n'''Boreland Mote''' or Motte is on OS mapping and sits at the side of the B733.  It is about 20 feet high and 100-120feet around the base (see photo).<ref>http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/62838/details/boreland+mote/</ref>\n\n'''Mindork or Mondork Castle''', Wood Hill.

He married Janet Baillie, and was ancestor of the Gordons of Craighlaw.\n\nThe railway station of the [[Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway]] closed in 1965.\n\nA mill was erected in 1822 for the manufacture of woollen cloths,  blankets, plaidings, flannels, and plain and pilot cloths, for the dyeing and dressing of which the soft water of the Tarff was well adapted.\n\n==Notable People==\n*[[Thomas Hugh Milroy]] [[FRSE]] born here in 1869\n\n==Listed Buildings==\n[[List of listed buildings in Kirkcowan, Dumfries and Galloway]]\n\n==Gallery (click on photos)==\n<gallery>\nImage:Village street, Kirkcowan.jpg|Street scene in Kirkcowan.\nFile:Kirkcowan Church - geograph.org.uk - 902089.jpg|Kirkcowan Church.\nFile:Old church, Kirkcowan - geograph.org.uk - 578150.jpg|Old church, Kirkcowan.\nFile:The Burn at Craighlaw - geograph.org.uk - 1132158.jpg|Craighlaw Castle.\nFile:Bridge to island, Craichlaw Loch - geograph.org.uk - 434610.jpg|Bridge to island, Craichlaw Loch.\nFile:The Linn of Barhoise - geograph.org.uk - 803094.jpg|The Linn of Barhoise Waterfall on the River Bladnoch.\nFile:Wood Cairn - geograph.org.uk - 771789.jpg|Eldrig Fell, large Wood Cairn.\nFile:White Cairn - geograph.org.uk - 447250.jpg|White Cairn.\nFile:Rough pasture near Mindork Farm - geograph.org.uk - 163205.jpg|near Mindork or Mondork Castle ruin.\nFile:Shennanton.jpg|Shennanton.

If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.\n*In the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other.

If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.\n*In the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter-final winners is not known at the time of the semi-final draw.

Both names were also used after the unification, with Italian Libya becoming the official name of the newly combined colony. \n\nIn 1923, indigenous rebels associated with the [[Senussi]] Order organized the [[Libyan resistance movement]] against Italian settlement in Libya.

British Egypt had ceded Kufra and Jarabub to Italian Libya on December 6, 1925, but it was not until the early 1930s that Italy was in full control of the place.

This citizenship was necessary for any Libyan with ambitions to rise in the military or civil organizations. The recipients were officially referred to as Moslem Italians. Libya had become the fourth shore of Italy\u201d(Trye 1998). The incorporation of Libya into the Italian Empire gave the Italian Army a greater ability to exploit native Libyans for military service. Native Libyans served in Italian formations from the beginning of the Italian occupation of Libya. On 1 March 1940, the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions were formed. These Libyan Infantry divisions were organized along the lines of the binary Italian infantry division. The 5th Italian Army received the 2nd Libyan Infantry division which it incorporated into the 13th corps. The Italian 10th Army received the 1st Libyan Infantry Division which it incorporated into the reserve. The Italian Libyan infantry divisions were colonial formations (\"colonial\" in the sense of consisting of native troops). These formations had Italian officers commanding them with Libyan NCOs and soldiers. These native Libyan formations were made up of people drawn from the coastal Libyan populations. The training and readiness of these divisions was on an equal footing with the regular Italian formations in North Africa. Their professionalism and 'esprit de corps' made them some of the best Italian infantry formations in North Africa. The Libyan divisions were loyal to Italy and provided a good combat record.<ref>[http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=597&filename=591.pdf.

The first [[Siege of Tobruk]] in April 1941 marked the first failure of Rommel's [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics. In 1942 there was the [[Battle of Gazala]] when the Axis troops finally conquered Tobruk and pushed the defeated British troops inside Egypt again. Defeat during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in Egypt spelled doom for the Axis forces in Libya and meant the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\nIn February 1943, retreating German and Italian forces were forced to abandon Libya as they were pushed out of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, thus ending Italian jurisdiction and control over Libya.\n\nThe Fezzan was occupied by the [[Free French]] in 1943.

Both names were also used after the unification, with Italian Libya becoming the official name of the newly combined colony. \n\nIn 1923, indigenous rebels associated with the [[Senussi]] Order organized the [[Libyan resistance movement]] against Italian settlement in Libya.

This citizenship was necessary for any Libyan with ambitions to rise in the military or civil organizations. The recipients were officially referred to as Moslem Italians. Libya had become the fourth shore of Italy\u201d(Trye 1998). The incorporation of Libya into the Italian Empire gave the Italian Army a greater ability to exploit native Libyans for military service. Native Libyans served in Italian formations from the beginning of the Italian occupation of Libya. On 1 March 1940, the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions were formed. These Libyan Infantry divisions were organized along the lines of the binary Italian infantry division. The 5th Italian Army received the 2nd Libyan Infantry division which it incorporated into the 13th corps. The Italian 10th Army received the 1st Libyan Infantry Division which it incorporated into the reserve. The Italian Libyan infantry divisions were colonial formations (\"colonial\" in the sense of consisting of native troops). These formations had Italian officers commanding them with Libyan NCOs and soldiers. These native Libyan formations were made up of people drawn from the coastal Libyan populations. The training and readiness of these divisions was on an equal footing with the regular Italian formations in North Africa. Their professionalism and 'esprit de corps' made them some of the best Italian infantry formations in North Africa. The Libyan divisions were loyal to Italy and provided a good combat record.<ref>[http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=597&filename=591.pdf.

In 1942 there was the [[Battle of Gazala]] when the Axis troops finally conquered Tobruk and pushed the defeated British troops inside Egypt again. Defeat during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in Egypt spelled doom for the Axis forces in Libya and meant the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\nIn February 1943, retreating German and Italian forces were forced to abandon Libya as they were pushed out of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, thus ending Italian jurisdiction and control over Libya.\n\nThe Fezzan was occupied by the [[Free French]] in 1943.
