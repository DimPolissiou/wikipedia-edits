Hinson. In the following year, further efforts were begun to establish a graduate-level seminary to provide a theological education of greater depth in the [[Northwestern United States]]. The Western Baptist Theological Seminary was officially dedicated on October 4, 1927.\n\nThe board acquired the [[Philip Buehner House]], now Armstrong Hall, and {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land on the west slope of Portland's [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mt. Tabor]] in 1944. Additional structures were built and classes convened at the new site in the fall of that year. The Portland campus continues to operate at this site at the crest of the [[Hawthorne District]].\n\nThe Western Baptist Theological Seminary became Western Seminary. Western Seminary has opened several extension campus locations in the [[Western United States]]. The first branch campus was launched in [[San Jose, California]] in 1986, followed by another in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1988. A [[Sacramento, California]] campus was opened in 1991, as was the former [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] campus in 1992. The Phoenix campus has become an independent seminary, [[Phoenix Seminary]]. Western Seminary's former Seattle campus is now [[The Seattle School of Theology & Psychology]] (formerly Mars Hill Graduate School).\n\nWestern's presidents have been reputable leaders in theological education, including Earl D. Radmacher (1965\u20131989) and Bert Downs (1998\u20132008). The current president is Randal Roberts (starting in 2008).\n\nWestern has developed many solutions to help non-residential students complete their coursework. Western was one of the earliest institutions to offer the Doctor of Ministry degree, with [[modular scheduling]] for easy out of state access. In 1981, Western began an online-only program that served hundreds of students per year in study centers across America and overseas through interactive video curriculum. In adapting courses to DVD and online streaming formats, the Western Seminary Online Campus offers distance learning courses and programs.\n\nIn 2005, Western expanded its training sites along the west coast by establishing learning cohorts in such cities as [[Seattle]] and [[Richland, Washington]], [[Reno, Nevada]] and [[Bakersfield, California]].\n\nIn 2010, the [[San Jose, California]] campus relocated to [[Santa Clara, California]].\n\nIn 2013, Western Seminary changed the name of its online learning department to Western Seminary Online Campus (formerly \"Center for Lifelong Learning\") as it began to offer its fully online degree program.\n\nIn 2014, the seminary launched a Seattle Teaching Site in [[Bellevue, Washington]] to offer classes to the Puget Sound Area. The [[Sacramento, California]] campus relocated to a new facility in the Sacramento community of [[Rocklin, California]].\n\nIn 2016, the [[San Jose, California]] campus relocated to [[Milpitas, California]].\n\n==Academics==\nWestern Seminary offers the Master of Arts, Master of Divinity, and Master of Theology degrees.

The chinch bug naturally feeds on wild prairie grasses. As the midwestern states were settled in the nineteenth century and crops of wheat, corn, sorghum and other grains were planted, they adapted well to these new species as habitat and food species. Throughout the 20th century, the chinch bug was a major pest to farmers, as it quickly decimated corn or wheat fields. To deal with this problem, many farmers in the area changed their crops to soybeans, which were not a host to the chinch bug. This led to a huge decrease in the chinch bug population in this area. Today they are mostly a common lawn pest and are commonly treated with pesticides and pest-resistant grasses.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Henry\">{{cite journal\n|author=Henry, T.J.\n|year=1997\n|title=Phylogenetic analysis of family groups within the infraorder Pentatomomorpha (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), with emphasis on the Lygaeoidea\n|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America\n|volume=90\n|issue=3\n|pages=275\u2013301\n|doi=10.1093/aesa/90.3.275}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web\n|title=chinch, n.{{sup|''1''}}\n|website=Oxford English Dictionary on-line\n|accessdate=16 December 2014\n|url=http://www.oed.com/\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Say\">{{cite book\n|author=Thomas Say\n|date=1831\n|chapter=Descriptions of new species of Heteropterous Hemiptera of North America\n|title=The complete writings of Thomas Say on the entomology of North America\n|editor=John L. le Conte\n|at=p. 329\n|chapter-url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/79301#page/357/mode/1up}}</ref>\n}}\n\n*http://bugguide.net/node/view/26129\n*Waldbauer, Gilbert, ''Insights from Insects, What Bad Bugs Can Teach Us''. 2005.

Founded as '''Wilhelmina''' in 1908, the club changed to various names before settling on being called after its neighborhood in 1912 as '''SC Feijenoord''', updated in 1974 to '''SC Feyenoord''',<ref name=\"Wist u dat\"/> and then to ''Feyenoord Rotterdam'' in 1978, when it split from the amateur club under its wing, [[SC Feyenoord]]. Since 1937, Feyenoord's [[home ground]] has been the Stadion Feijenoord, nicknamed [[De Kuip]] ('the tub'), one of the largest stadiums in the Netherlands and Europe.\n\nFeyenoord is one of the most successful clubs in [[Dutch football]], winning 15 Eredivisie titles, 13 [[KNVB Cup]]s, and 4 [[Johan Cruyff Shield]]s. Internationally, it has won one [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], two [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]s, and one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]. The club has played [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|continuously]] in the top tier of the [[Dutch football league system|Dutch football system]] since gaining promotion to ''Eerste Klasse (''the Eredivisie's forerunner competition) in [[1921\u201322 Netherlands Football League Championship|1921]], more times than any other club in the country,<ref name=\"rsssf\">{{cite web |title=Coventric! |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/coventric.html |website=RSSSF.com |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> including the likes of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]].\n\nFeyenoord is known as a people's club with a huge national and international support. Its most successful period was the 1960s and 1970s, when [[Coen Moulijn]] and [[Ove Kindvall]] led the club to six league titles, two European trophies, and an Intercontinental Cup, thereby becoming the first Dutch club in history to win both the European Cup and the Intercontinental Cup. In the 21st century, Feyenoord ended an 18-year league title drought in [[2016\u201317 Eredivisie|2017]] and won the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final|2002 UEFA Cup]] against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in its home stadium.\n\nFeyenoord has a longstanding rivalry with Ajax, a clash between two teams from the two biggest cities in the Netherlands, called ''[[De Klassieker]]'' (\"The Classic\"). The club's anthem is \"Hand in Hand\".\n\nAs of 2017, Feyenoord is a multi-sports club, including Sportclub Feyenoord (amateur football team), [[Feyenoord Basketbal]], Feyenoord Futsal and Feyenoord Handball.<ref>https://www.feyenoord.nl/de-club/organisatie/multisport</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Feyenoord Rotterdam}}\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Feyenoord logo 1912.gif|thumb|The first logo (1912)]]\n\nThe football club '''Wilhelmina''' was founded in the pub ''De Vereeniging'' on 19 July 1908<ref name=\"hist1\">[http://www.frgoals.nl/index.php?pagina=historie Oprichting Wilhelmina], frgoals.nl</ref> and played in blue-sleeved red shirts and white shorts.<ref name=\"hist1\"/> Between 1908, 1910, 1911, and 1912, the club underwent a series of changes of name and team colours, becoming '''Hillesluise Football Club''' in 1909,<ref name=\"hist2\">[http://www.frgoals.nl/index.php?pagina=historie HFC en Celeritas], frgoals.nl</ref> and then '''RVV Celeritas'''. Upon earning promotion to the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|National football association]] in 1912, the club renamed to SC Feijenoord (after the city district in which the team was founded), and changed uniform once again, adopting the red and white shirts, black shorts and black socks that they still wear today.<ref name=\"hist3\">[http://www.frgoals.nl/index.php?pagina=historie Tot Feijenoord en de eerste prijzen], frgoals.nl</ref> In 1918, Feijenoord were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football and moved to the ground ''Kromme Zandweg''.<ref name=\"hist3\"/>\n\n===First successes===\nAfter 18 years, the formation of the club and a mere three years after they were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football Feijenoord earned their first honours by capturing the national league championship in 1924.<ref name=\"hist3\"/> The team enjoyed a string of successes in the latter half of the decade, taking divisional titles in 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929, and winning their second national championship in 1928.<ref name=\"hist3\"/>\n\nFeijenoord won their first [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] in 1930 by scoring the only goal in a [[Local derby|derby]] final against [[SBV Excelsior|Excelsior]].<ref name=\"cupfinals\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/nedcuphist.html Netherlands Cup Finals], rsssf.com</ref> They continued to dominate their division with three consecutive titles, but were winless in subsequent championship finals.

The club moved to the [[Feijenoord Stadion]] (nicknamed \"De Kuip\" or \"the Tub\") in 1937, playing the first match there on 27 March against [[K.F.C.

A brilliant performance of young Dutch left back [[Royston Drenthe]] at the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] had investors flocking to the new investment schemes Feyenoord had established.

After manager Fred Rutten opted not to extend his contract, on 23 March 2015 Feyenoord announced former Dutch international and Feyenoord player Giovanni van Bronckhorst would become its new manager. That summer the club contracted several new key players, [[Eric Botteghin]] from [[FC Groningen]], [[Jan-Arie van der Heijden]] from [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]], and [[Eljero Elia]] from [[SV Werder Bremen]].

That was with a little help from the referee as Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen, who gave the assist, was clearly offside. This match, and all of Feyenoord's European home games were played in only a half-full stadium. These measurements were taken to avoid new penalties from the UEFA. In that same week reigning Dutch champions PSV were beaten, 0\u20131. The first loss of points was against Ajax on 23 October 2016.

In the Eredivisie the team booked big victories, such as a 6\u20131 defeat against Spartaand 0\u20134 against AZ. With a 5-point lead to second place Ajax, Feyenoord ended the year at the top of the league table.\n\nThe second half of the season, Feyenoord started strong, winning the first seven league games of 2017. However, in Arnhem, Vitesse proved to be too strong in the KNVB Cup (2-0). Feyenoord beat PSV at home (2-1)due, to an own goal from PSV-goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, which was indicated by [[Goal-line technology]]. On 5 March, Sparta was the first team to beat Feyenoord in the new year, by a goal in the first minute of the game, scored by [[Mathias Pogba]]. Feyenoord recovered quickly and another big win followed when they beat AZ, 5\u20132, and a week later SC Heerenveen were beat, 2\u20131. When Feyenoord lost to Ajax, and drew against PEC Zwolle, their lead was decreased to one point. After two more victories from Feyenoord, and a loss for number two Ajax against PSV, the gap was four points with two games to go. One week before the end of the competition, Feyenoord could become champions away at Excelsior, not 4 kilometers from their home stadium. However the team had an off-day and lost, 3\u20130. One week later, in the final game, the team still became champions by beating Heracles by 3\u20131. All three goals were made by the team captain, Dirk Kuyt, who would later announce his retirement. This championship was Feyenoord's 15th and the first in 18 years. Feyenoord also was only the second team in the history of the Dutch league to stay at the top of the table the entire season. Because of the championship, Feyenoord was allowed to compete for the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]] against cup winner Vitesse in the Kuip on 5 August 2017. After a 1\u20131 tie Feyenoord beat Vitesse by penalties.\n\nAs Dutch champion Feyenoord qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League group stage 2017/2018. They played in a group with [[Manchester City]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[SSC Napoli]]. Feyenoord lost the first 5 matches, but they won their last home match against Napoli (2-1).

The stadium would most likely be placed on the [[Nieuwe Maas]], the river that runs through Rotterdam, and should be completed by 2016.<ref>[http://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/article376313.ece/Feyenoord_houdt_zijn_identiteit/ \"Feyenoord behoudt zijn identiteit], Volkskrant</ref>\nIn May 2008, Woerts announced further details: the club is aiming for a stadium with a capacity of around 100,000 seats.<ref>[http://kr.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=688510 \"Feyenoord To Build Europe\u2019s Biggest Stadium\"], Goal.com</ref> If possible, a capacity of over 130,000 should be realized according to Woerts, which would earn the title of biggest stadium in Europe. The club emphasized its efforts to make it a true football stadium with seats close to the pitch. The stadium will get a retractable roof so that other events can be held as well. According to plans in those days, the stadium should be ready in 2016. Due to financial difficulties for all parties involved and the fact that the Netherlands were not chosen to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the plans for a new stadium have been put on hold. A new stadium will most likely be built in the future, though it will likely not have a spectator capacity greater than 70,000.\n\nIn September 2012, Feyenoord confirmed that there will arise a new stadium in 2018. The stadium will be built by builder [[VolkerWessels]], it will cost around \u20ac300&nbsp;million (~\u00a3242&nbsp;million). Another option was a plan made by a consortium of [[Royal BAM Group|BAM]], [[Eneco Energie]] and [[Siemens]]. But the plan was rejected by the Feyenoord and [[Stadion Feijenoord]] direction. The new stadium should be a 63,000 all-seater. Despite the new plans, much of the supporters prefer a renovation of De Kuip. One of those initiatives are ''Red de Kuip'', which is Dutch for Save de Kuip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddekuip.nl|title=Home \u2013 RedDeKuip|website=www.reddekuip.nl}}</ref> They made plans of building a third tier on top of the current stadium, increasing the capacity to 68,000. This plan would cost only \u20ac117&nbsp;million (~\u00a394&nbsp;million).\n\nIn 2016, Feyenoord announced their plans for a new stadium called Feyenoord City. The new stadium will have a capacity of 65,000. The city council agreed with the plans of Feyenoord City which also involve new sporting facilities, nightlife and renewed infrastructure. The old stadium 'De Kuip' will be transformed into an athletics track. The project is ought to be delivered in 2022.\n\n===Stadium songs===\n\n====Official Feyenoord hymn====\nFeyenoord's official hymn since 1961 is called \"Hand in Hand\".<ref>[http://www.ajax-usa.com/teams/feyenoord.html Feyenoord] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202012722/http://www.ajax-usa.com/teams/feyenoord.html |date=2 February 2007 }}, ajax-usa.com</ref> Its melody was written in the 19th century by German {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Speidel|de}}.

In the early years, the club mainly had English managers, as football was already professional there. Feyenoord's first Dutch coach was Engel Geneugelijk ([[ad interim]]), while [[Richard Kohn|Richard Dombi]] is seen as the first successful coach. He led the team in three different periods. During the club's weakest period, Feyenoord was coached by two coaches at once, the Dutchman [[Pim Verbeek]] and the Swede [[Gunder Bengtsson]]. Bengtsson was the last foreign coach to lead Feyenoord. Feyenoord's international trophies were won by [[Ernst Happel]], [[Wiel Coerver]] and [[Bert van Marwijk]].<ref>[http://www.fr4ever.nl/index.php?p=gesaltrainers Alle trainers van 1908 tot en met 2006]

The club has played [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|continuously]] in the top tier of the [[Dutch football league system|Dutch football system]] since gaining promotion to ''Eerste Klasse (''the Eredivisie's forerunner competition) in [[1921\u201322 Netherlands Football League Championship|1921]], more times than any other club in the country,<ref name=\"rsssf\">{{cite web |title=Coventric! |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/coventric.html |website=RSSSF.com |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> including the likes of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]].\n\nFeyenoord is known as a people's club with a huge national and international support. Its most successful period was the 1960s and 1970s, when [[Coen Moulijn]] and [[Ove Kindvall]] led the club to six league titles, two European trophies, and an Intercontinental Cup, thereby becoming the first Dutch club in history to win both the European Cup and the Intercontinental Cup. In the 21st century, Feyenoord ended an 18-year league title drought in [[2016\u201317 Eredivisie|2017]] and won the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final|2002 UEFA Cup]] against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in its home stadium.\n\nFeyenoord has a longstanding rivalry with Ajax, a clash between two teams from the two biggest cities in the Netherlands, called ''[[De Klassieker]]'' (\"The Classic\"). The club's anthem is \"Hand in Hand\".\n\nAs of 2017, Feyenoord is a multi-sports club, including Sportclub Feyenoord (amateur football team), [[Feyenoord Basketbal]], Feyenoord Futsal and Feyenoord Handball.<ref>https://www.feyenoord.nl/de-club/organisatie/multisport</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Feyenoord Rotterdam}}\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Feyenoord logo 1912.gif|thumb|The first logo (1912)]]\n\nThe football club '''Wilhelmina''' was founded in the pub ''De Vereeniging'' on 19 July 1908<ref name=\"hist1\">[http://www.frgoals.nl/index.php?pagina=historie Oprichting Wilhelmina], frgoals.nl</ref> and played in blue-sleeved red shirts and white shorts.<ref name=\"hist1\"/> Between 1908, 1910, 1911, and 1912, the club underwent a series of changes of name and team colours, becoming '''Hillesluise Football Club''' in 1909,<ref name=\"hist2\">[http://www.frgoals.nl/index.php?pagina=historie HFC en Celeritas], frgoals.nl</ref> and then '''RVV Celeritas'''. Upon earning promotion to the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|National football association]] in 1912, the club renamed to SC Feijenoord (after the city district in which the team was founded), and changed uniform once again, adopting the red and white shirts, black shorts and black socks that they still wear today.<ref name=\"hist3\">[http://www.frgoals.nl/index.php?pagina=historie Tot Feijenoord en de eerste prijzen], frgoals.nl</ref> In 1918, Feijenoord were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football and moved to the ground ''Kromme Zandweg''.<ref name=\"hist3\"/>\n\n===First successes===\nAfter 18 years, the formation of the club and a mere three years after they were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football Feijenoord earned their first honours by capturing the national league championship in 1924.<ref name=\"hist3\"/> The team enjoyed a string of successes in the latter half of the decade, taking divisional titles in 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929, and winning their second national championship in 1928.<ref name=\"hist3\"/>\n\nFeijenoord won their first [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] in 1930 by scoring the only goal in a [[Local derby|derby]] final against [[SBV Excelsior|Excelsior]].<ref name=\"cupfinals\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/nedcuphist.html Netherlands Cup Finals], rsssf.com</ref> They continued to dominate their division with three consecutive titles, but were winless in subsequent championship finals.

The club moved to the [[Feijenoord Stadion]] (nicknamed \"De Kuip\" or \"the Tub\") in 1937, playing the first match there on 27 March against [[K.F.C.

At the same time, it became clear Feyenoord were in an appalling financial state despite earlier comments made by chairman Jorien van den Herik, who claimed that the club was financially healthy. Supporters' unrest grew into anger when Feyenoord bought [[Angelos Charisteas]], a back-up striker of arch-rivals Ajax, with a poor track record, as a replacement for Dirk Kuyt. After continuous protests, Van den Herik resigned and the club began managerial reforms. However, the worst was not over.

While desperate supporters started preparing for a dark age, the club surprised friend and foe in the 2007 summer transfer window. A brilliant performance of young Dutch left back [[Royston Drenthe]] at the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] had investors flocking to the new investment schemes Feyenoord had established. The club appointed former manager Bert van Marwijk and was able to make a number of high-profile signings, including [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and [[Roy Makaay]]. Despite the efforts, Feyenoord underperformed once again in the [[2007\u201308 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]], finishing in a disappointing sixth place. The pain was relieved by claiming the first prize in six years: 100&nbsp;years after the foundation of the club, Feyenoord managed to win the [[2007\u201308 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] after defeating Roda JC 2\u20130. As Van Marwijk accepted a job as manager of the national team, Feyenoord appointed [[Gertjan Verbeek]] as their manager for the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n===Financial problems===\nIn the [[2008\u201309 Eredivisie|2008\u201309 season]], Feyenoord celebrated their 100th birthday and organised many events throughout the year.

The results in this period improved slightly, resulting in securing a spot in the playoffs for the final Dutch Europa League slot.\n\nFor the [[2009\u201310 Feyenoord season|2009\u201310 season]], Feyenoord appointed former assistant manager and Feyenoord footballer [[Mario Been]] to take over from Vlemmings. Been, after achieving minor European successes with NEC, was considered the ideal candidate for the job. Former manager Leo Beenhakker, at the time manager of the [[Poland national football team|Poland national team]], took over as technical director. Partly because of this position, Beenhakker was able to attract more investors to the club, leading to some unexpected signings, including [[Sekou Ciss\u00e9]], [[Dani Fern\u00e1ndez (footballer, born 1983)|Dani Fern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Stefan Babovi\u0107]].\n\nOn 24 October 2010, Feyenoord lost heavily to PSV 10\u20130.

In the play-offs to earn a spot for Europa League, they were eliminated by Heerenveen. After manager Fred Rutten opted not to extend his contract, on 23 March 2015 Feyenoord announced former Dutch international and Feyenoord player Giovanni van Bronckhorst would become its new manager. That summer the club contracted several new key players, [[Eric Botteghin]] from [[FC Groningen]], [[Jan-Arie van der Heijden]] from [[SBV_Vitesse|Vitesse]], and [[Eljero Elia]] from [[SV Werder Bremen]]. It also welcomed back club legend [[Dirk Kuyt]] from [[Fenerbah\u00e7e_S.K._(football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] on a one-year contract.\n\nAfter eight years without any prizes, Feyenoord won its 12th KNVB Cup on 24 April 2016. In the Eredivisie the team came third, a distance behind Ajax and the champions PSV. That next summer Feyenoord managed to do some good business in the transfer market. The contracts of starting players like Dirk Kuyt and Eljero Elia were extended. Furthermore, it acquired [[Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen]] from [[F.C. Copenhagen]] for \u20ac3.500.000 and [[Brad Jones (footballer)|Brad Jones]] was contracted on a free transfer from [[N.E.C.]] as a replacement for injured first-choice goalkeeper [[Kenneth Vermeer]].\n\nThe 2016/2017 season started perfectly, as the first nine league matches were won, and Feyenoord beat Manchester United F.C. 1\u20130 in the Europe League. That was with a little help from the referee as Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen, who gave the assist, was clearly offside. This match, and all of Feyenoord's European home games were played in only a half-full stadium. These measurements were taken to avoid new penalties from the UEFA. In that same week reigning Dutch champions PSV were beaten, 0\u20131. The first loss of points was against Ajax on 23 October 2016. The final score was 1\u20131 after goals of [[Kasper Dolberg]] and Dirk Kuyt. A week later another draw followed against [[SC Heerenveen]] On 6 November, a weakened team lost for the first time that season; relegation candidate [[Go Ahead Eagles]] won, 1-0] In the European campaign Feyenoord struggled, and after losses to Manchester United (4-0)and Fenerbah\u00e7e (0-1) the European adventure ended. In the Eredivisie the team booked big victories, such as a 6\u20131 defeat against Spartaand 0\u20134 against AZ. With a 5-point lead to second place Ajax, Feyenoord ended the year at the top of the league table. \n\nThe second half of the season, Feyenoord started strong, winning the first seven league games of 2017. However, in Arnhem, Vitesse proved to be too strong in the KNVB Cup (2-0). Feyenoord beat PSV at home (2-1)due, to an own goal from PSV-goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, which was indicated by [[Goal-line technology]]. On 5 March, Sparta was the first team to beat Feyenoord in the new year, by a goal in the first minute of the game, scored by [[Mathias Pogba]]. Feyenoord recovered quickly and another big win followed when they beat AZ, 5\u20132, and a week later SC Heerenveen were beat, 2\u20131. When Feyenoord lost to Ajax, and drew against PEC Zwolle, their lead was decreased to one point. After two more victories from Feyenoord, and a loss for number two Ajax against PSV, the gap was four points with two games to go. One week before the end of the competition, Feyenoord could become champions away at Excelsior, not 4 kilometers from their home stadium. However the team had an off-day and lost, 3\u20130. One week later, in the final game, the team still became champions by beating Heracles by 3\u20131. All three goals were made by the team captain, Dirk Kuyt, who would later announce his retirement. This championship was Feyenoord's 15th and the first in 18 years. Feyenoord also was only the second team in the history of the Dutch league to stay at the top of the table the entire season. Because of the championship, Feyenoord was allowed to compete for the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]] against cup winner Vitesse in the Kuip on 5 August 2017. After a 1\u20131 tie Feyenoord beat Vitesse by penalties.\n\nAs Dutch champion Feyenoord qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League group stage 2017/2018. They played in a group with [[Manchester City]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[SSC Napoli]]. Feyenoord lost the first 5 matches, but they won their last home match against Napoli (2-1).

According to plans in those days, the stadium should be ready in 2016. Due to financial difficulties for all parties involved and the fact that the Netherlands were not chosen to host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the plans for a new stadium have been put on hold. A new stadium will most likely be built in the future, though it will likely not have a spectator capacity greater than 70,000.\n\nIn September 2012, Feyenoord confirmed that there will arise a new stadium in 2018.

Another option was a plan made by a consortium of [[Royal BAM Group|BAM]], [[Eneco Energie]] and [[Siemens]]. But the plan was rejected by the Feyenoord and [[Stadion Feijenoord]] direction. The new stadium should be a 63,000 all-seater. Despite the new plans, much of the supporters prefer a renovation of De Kuip.

The new stadium will have a capacity of 65,000. The city council agreed with the plans of Feyenoord City which also involve new sporting facilities, nightlife and renewed infrastructure.

In the early years, the club mainly had English managers, as football was already professional there. Feyenoord's first Dutch coach was Engel Geneugelijk ([[ad interim]]), while [[Richard Kohn|Richard Dombi]] is seen as the first successful coach. He led the team in three different periods. During the club's weakest period, Feyenoord was coached by two coaches at once, the Dutchman [[Pim Verbeek]] and the Swede [[Gunder Bengtsson]]. Bengtsson was the last foreign coach to lead Feyenoord. Feyenoord's international trophies were won by [[Ernst Happel]], [[Wiel Coerver]] and [[Bert van Marwijk]].<ref>[http://www.fr4ever.nl/index.php?p=gesaltrainers Alle trainers van 1908 tot en met 2006]

In 1853, the name was changed from the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) to the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) and L\u00e9on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/quim0.htm|title=Diocese of Quimper, France}}</ref>\n\nOriginally established in the 5th century, the diocese was dismantled during the anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]]. It was restored by the [[Concordat of 1801]], as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] and [[Tr\u00e9guier]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]]. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin.\n\n==History==\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: early history===\nTwo versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperl\u00e9; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.<ref>Duchesne, ''Fasti'' II, p. 372.</ref> Both mention a [[St Corentinus|St. Chorentius]] as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 17 Mar. 2013]</ref> The earliest historical reference dates from 453. An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137. Duchesne, II, p. 247.</ref>\n\n====Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on====\n[[File:Kathedrale von Saint Pol de L\u00e8on.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Cathedral St.-Paul-Aurelian, Saint-Pol]]\nThere is evidence that Christianity was preached in L\u00e9on twenty years before the evangelization of [[Cornouaille]], but ancient Breton chronology is very uncertain. The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437). Besse, pp. 270-275.</ref>\n\n====Other churches====\nThe Cathedral of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, which is now in the Diocese of Quimper, was built between the 13th and 16th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Malo Th\u00e9ophile Peyron|title=La cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Pol et le minihy L\u00e9on|url=https://archive.org/details/lacathdraledesa00peyrgoog|year=1901|publisher=A. de Kerangal|location=Quimper|language=French|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lacathdraledesa00peyrgoog/page/n36 28]\u201332}}  A list of the Bishops of Saint-Pol de L\u00e9on is given at pp. 6-11.</ref> The Church of Notre Dame de Creisker, in the same town, restored in the fourteenth century, has a [[Bell tower|belfry]] which the Bretons claim to be the handsomest in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Formerly Quimperl\u00e9 had an important Benedictine abbey, Sainte Croix, founded in 1029 and where the [[Benedictine]]s of St. Maur took up their residence in 1665. Along with all abbeys, convents, and monasteries, it was suppressed by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Monastic vows were abolished.

Albert Le Grand wrote the \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" (1636) and published a [[Breton language|Breton]] dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. Today he is considered by some{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} to be the founder of Breton philology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  There was already a grammar school in Quimper in 1348, but never a university.

The entire diocese contained some 180 parishes.<ref>Ritzler, VI, p. 184, note 1. Jean, p. 433, reports that there were 173 parishes.</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\n\nDuring the French revolution the Diocese of Quimper was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Finist\u00e8re', which was made a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the 'Metropole du Nord-Ouest' with its seat at Rennes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114534/http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/civilconstitution.html Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English)] Retrieved: 2016-09-02.</ref> The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the department.  This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791. Expilly then assisted [[Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel|Jean-Baptiste Gobel]], a legitimate bishop consecrated in 1772, who had apostasized and was then Constitutional Bishop of Paris, in the consecration of additional Constitutional bishops on 27 February and 6 March.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.

He faced great difficulties both from the flight of many of his clergy in the face of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], and from the seizure of large areas of the countryside by the [[Chouan]]s, who were loyal to the monarchy.  He had himself elected president of the departmental Directory, but his increasingly moderate stance brought him under suspicion from the [[Jacobin]]s.

A. de Kerangal|location=Quimper|language=French}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the [[Concordat of 1801]], Pope Pius VII restored the Diocese of Quimper in 1802. The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes', did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

In 1853, the name was changed from the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) to the Diocese of Quimper (\u2013Cornouaille) and L\u00e9on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/quim0.htm|title=Diocese of Quimper, France}}</ref>\n\nOriginally established in the 5th century, the diocese was dismantled during the anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]]. It was restored by the [[Concordat of 1801]], as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] and [[Tr\u00e9guier]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]]. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin.\n\n==History==\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: early history===\nTwo versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperl\u00e9; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.<ref>Duchesne, ''Fasti'' II, p. 372.</ref> Both mention a [[St Corentinus|St. Chorentius]] as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137.

The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437).

Along with all abbeys, convents, and monasteries, it was suppressed by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Monastic vows were abolished.

Albert Le Grand wrote the \"Lives of the Saints of Brittany\" (1636) and published a [[Breton language|Breton]] dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. Today he is considered by some{{weasel inline|date=January 2017}} to be the founder of Breton philology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  There was already a grammar school in Quimper in 1348, but never a university.

The entire diocese contained some 180 parishes.<ref>Ritzler, VI, p. 184, note 1. Jean, p. 433, reports that there were 173 parishes.</ref>\n\n===The Revolution===\n\nDuring the French revolution the Diocese of Quimper was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Finist\u00e8re', which was made a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of the 'Metropole du Nord-Ouest' with its seat at Rennes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114534/http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/civilconstitution.html Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English)] Retrieved: 2016-09-02.</ref> The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the departement.  This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791. Expilly then assisted [[Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel|Jean-Baptiste Gobel]], a legitimate bishop consecrated in 1772, who had apostasized and was then Constitutional Bishop of Paris, in the consecration of additional Constitutional bishops on 27 February and 6 March.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Pisani|title=R\u00e9pertoire biographique de l'\u00e9piscopat constitutionnel (1791-1802).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAQ9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA434|year=1907|publisher=A.

He faced great difficulties both from the flight of many of his clergy in the face of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], and from the seizure of large areas of the countryside by the [[Chouan]]s, who were loyal to the monarchy.  He had himself elected president of the departmental Directory, but his increasingly moderate stance brought him under suspicion from the [[Jacobin]]s.

The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes' did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.
