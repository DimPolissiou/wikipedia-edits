Cap\u00f3's composition describing his homesickness for Puerto Rico, \"So\u00f1ando con Puerto Rico\" (''Dreaming of Puerto Rico''), is revered as an anthem by Puerto Ricans residing abroad.

[[Josephine Baker]] recorded a version in [[French language|French]]. The song became the main theme for a Mexican movie of the same name in the late 1950s.
