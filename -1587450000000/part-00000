[[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE Boot]], and Koan are methods that can be used to implement bare metal installs and re-imaging of hosts.\n\n===Manage===\nSatellite assists in remotely managing hosts in several areas: software, operational management, and configuration.

The organisation's hosts then register against the local Satellite server, instead of directly against Red Hat Network.\n\nFor secure deployments, Satellite can operate in a \"Disconnected\" mode, where updates are downloaded directly from Red Hat via an Internet connected machine and then uploaded into Satellite or a local offline RHN proxy.\n\nBoth modes allow the organisation to control which versions of software it makes available for its hosts, as well as making additional software available within the local network.\n\n==Red Hat Satellite 6 components==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=left|Component<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-satellite/6.2/paged/architecture-guide/12-system-components|title=architecture-guide Components|accessdate=2017-02-02|publisher=Red Hat}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-satellite/6.2/paged/architecture-guide/13-supported-usage|title=architecture-guide Components usage|accessdate=2017-02-02|publisher=Red Hat}}</ref>\n!align=left|Details\n|-\n|align=left|[[Foreman (software)|The Foreman]]\n|align=left|Provision and Life Cycle Management of physical and virtual systems\n|-\n|align=left|Katello\n|align=left|Foreman Plug-in for Subscription and Repository Management\n|-\n|align=left|Candlepin\n|align=left|Service in Katello to handle subscription management\n|-\n|align=left|Pulp\n|align=left|Service in Katello to handle repository and content management\n|-\n|align=left|Hammer\n|align=left|[[Command-line interface|CLI]] tool providing command line and shell equivalents of most WEB UI functions\n|-\n|align=left|REST API\n|align=left|RESTful API service for System Administrators and Developers to write custom scripts and third party interface applications\n|-\n|align=left|[[Apache Tomcat]]\n|align=left|Embedded Tomcat server than must be interfaced via specified tools\n|-\n|align=left|[[Puppet (software)|Puppet]]\n|align=left|A Puppet Master server installed as part of a Red Hat Satellite 6 Master Server or Capsule server\n|-\n|align=left|Hiera<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.puppet.com/hiera/3.2/|title=Hiera 3.2|accessdate=2017-02-02|publisher=Puppet}}</ref>\n|align=left|A Key-Value database that is part of Puppet and helps keep site specific data out of manifests\n|}\n\n==Major modules<ref name=\"linuxMag60EARLY\">{{Cite Journal\n|url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2015/171/Red-Hat-Satellite-6\n|title=Exploring Red Hat Satellite Server 6|publisher=Linux Magazine\n|date=1 February 2015|accessdate=3 February 2017|first1=Martin|last1=Loschwitz|first2=Markus|last2=Feilner|first3=Joe|last3=Casad|issue=171|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827165032/http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2015/171/Red-Hat-Satellite-6|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-access=limited}}</ref>==\n\n===Provision===\nSatellite offers numerous methods for deploying hosts, including simple ''[[Kickstart (Linux)|kickstart]]'', ''[[bare machine|bare metal]] install'' and [[Disk image|re-imaging]]. Current versions of Satellite support kickstart using [[Cobbler (software)|Cobbler]] as an underlying framework. [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE Boot]], and Koan are methods that can be used to implement bare metal installs and re-imaging of hosts.\n\n===Manage===\nSatellite assists in remotely managing hosts in several areas: software, operational management, and configuration. The 3{{clarify|reason=There are four bullet items|date=June 2015}} main mechanisms for managing hosts are:\n\n* Software Channel\n* Configuration Channels\n* Activation Keys\n\n===Monitor===\nSatellite can provide monitoring of software and systems via probes. These probes periodically explore the target host and send alerts if the probes do not get the correct replies, or if the replies fall outside of some specified range.\n\n==History and Lifecycle==\nA primary purpose of earlier versions of Satellite was to  allow organizations to utilize the benefits of [[Red Hat Network]] (RHN) without having to provide public Internet access to their servers or other client systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite/5.0/html/Installation_Guide/s1-intro-sat.html|title=Red Hat Network Satellite 5.0 Installation Guide - RHN Satellite Server|accessdate=2017-02-03|date=2008}}</ref>  Later version of the tool have developed increased functionality.\n\n<!-- Template:Version - for version & release history.

The film stars Max Records, Robinson, Jenni Fontana, and James Nardini. It tells the story of a boy who adopts a robot and begins neglecting it, until [[malicious compliance|the robot complies with commands to murder]]. The film was released in March 20, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the near future, where robotics have greatly evolved, Alex is looking for the normal loving family that he doesn't have - his parents are always too busy fighting with each other to worry about the effect on him. After seeing an advertisement for a domestic robot named 'Blinky', he asks his parents for one for Christmas, hoping that it will bring his family together as is shown in the advert. Blinky's advertisement and conduct at this point indicate that Blinky is specifically designed to provide friendship to its masters. After obtaining Blinky and playing with him for a while, shown in a home-video style montage, Alex feels disappointment in the fact that Blinky hasn't changed anything and his parents continue to argue. Eventually, Alex becomes tired of the robot and ignores him, even when Blinky persistently asks to play games.\n\nAfter leaving Blinky to count down from 1 million outside in the rain in a game of Hide and Seek, Alex becomes frustrated and gives Blinky multiple conflicting orders, such as telling him to be still and at the same time cleaning up, as well as telling him to kill both his parents, himself, their dog and everyone else in his rage, leading Blinky to malfunction. After Alex informs his mother about the glitched robot and that they need to buy a new one, she suggests rebooting him, and that Alex must clean up the mess he made or she will tell Blinky to \u2033clean [him] up and cook [him] for dinner\". Alex reboots Blinky, appearing to have reverted to factory settings, and asking Alex \"will you be my best friend?\" Alex continues to ignore Blinky as normal.\n\nSoon afterwards, Blinky starts to behave abnormally, such as showing up in Alex's room overnight, and continuing the count down from before. The next day the family dog appears to be gone, with Alex believing that the robot had something to do with it. He tells his mother his forebodings, but she thinks he's just already tired of Blinky and wants a new robot. The next day Alex goes into another rage with Blinky, throwing an electronic tablet at him. The tablet simply shatters glass throughout the room, causing no damage to Blinky. Alex gets even angrier and blames the mess on Blinky, so Blinky retreats to the kitchen to 'clean', counting down from 10 and grabbing an electric knife from the drawers, proclaiming \"ready or not, here I come\". That evening, both parents are eating dinner at the table, with Blinky present and Alex's seat empty. As Alex's mother asks Blinky if he has seen Alex, the robot replies that he is right there at the table, and reveals that he has carried out both his and the mother's 'command' from before: he has killed Alex, cleaned him and cooked him into meatballs, which they are now eating. The parents scream in horror as Blinky asks if he has \"done good\".\n\nWhile a TV advertisement orders the people to contact immediately if Blinky acts abnormally, the police arrive at the house as Blinky is cleaning up supposedly the parents' blood. He lets two officers into the house, and shuts the door behind them. The last shot shows Blinky as he kills his next victims, himself and the camera covered in blood, as he carries out Alex's past 'commands' to kill everybody.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Max Records]] as Alex Neville \n*[[Ruair\u00ed Robinson]] as Blinky (voice)\n*Jenni Fontana as Mrs. Neville\n*James Nardini as Mr. Neville\n*[[Joe Childs]] as Blinky's performance capture\n\n==Production==\n''BlinkyTM'' was based on a short story by writer/director [[Ruair\u00ed Robinson]].
