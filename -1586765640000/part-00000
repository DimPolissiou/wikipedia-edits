It replaced the modular-based 1950s \"Old style\" [[Tan (color)|tan]]-[[khaki]] cotton canvas equipment (similar in design to the [[British Army]]'s [[58 pattern webbing]]) and a variety of load-carrying waistcoats and assault vests used by Israeli infantry and elite units during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]], the [[War of Attrition|1967-1970 War of Attrition]], and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]].<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref>\n\n==History and development==\nThe IDF load-bearing system or '''Ephod''' (\"apron\" or \"avantail\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) is the direct result of the long experience acquired over the years with the \"commando web gear\" originally worn by [[Israeli special forces units|Israeli recon paratroopers]] during the War of Attrition, who made crude but comfortable Khaki or Olive Green waistcoats and assault vests incorporating many small canvas or [[Cordura|Nylon]] pouches.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref><ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref> Known as the \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment, the Ephod was designed by the Israeli private firm [[Rabintex Industries Ltd.]] of [[Herzeliya]] near [[Tel Aviv]] in 1975-76, who allegedly developed it from an American prototype.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 39.</ref>\n\n===Description===\nThe \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment prototype presented in 1976 by Rabintex was made entirely of [[Olive (color)|olive green]] (OG) [[Cordura|Cordura-type nylon]] and consisted of wide unpadded shoulder straps or suspenders and an \"X\"-back harness or \"yoke\" system fitted with three chest/side and back panels fitted with a detachable [[Foam rubber|foam]]-padded waist-band or \"belt\", secured at the front by two strap-and-buckle attachment loops. One novel feature of the Ephod is that his yoke spread the weight to be borne over the shoulders and was not secured to a conventional waist belt. His suspenders were joined in the area of the shoulder-blades by a lateral piece to which was stitched a rectangular web loop with eyelets for attaching a [[Entrenching tool|U.S.-type entrenching tool]], a feature also found in the \"Old style\" web gear suspenders.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother feature of the Ephod was his wide cushioned waist-band fitted at the back of the panels by snap buttons, which distributed the weight well all around the waist. Many Israeli soldiers in the field had found the canvas material of the IDF standard issue \"Old style\" web gear and the load they carried to be very uncomfortable, and so wore padding underneath the pistol belt and waist pouches;<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), pp. 5; 52-53.</ref> this aspect was taken into consideration by the designers of the Ephod, who devised a unique system in which the ammunition pouches, the grenade carriers and other equipment rest on three [[Foam rubber|foam]] pads tied together by [[parachute cord]] lacing at four points, allowing infinite adjustment to individual size.<ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref><ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> Like the front extremities of the yoke, they were not secured to the cushioned waist-band but to the pouches instead.\n\nThe pouches came in three sets, left, right, and back. Each consists of a nylon base panel, in which a total of nine integral nylon pouches of five different sizes, comprising four large magazine pouches, two individual [[hand grenade]] carriers, one [[smoke grenade]] carrier, one [[First aid kit]] pouch and one rear pouch for carrying [[binoculars]] or [[Night-vision device|night-vision equipment]] are stitched.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> All pouch flaps are fitted with [[Velcro]] [[Hook-and-loop fastener]] strips reinforced by a single metal eyelet and the larger magazine pouches each had at the lower end a nylon frog with two eyelets for additional pouches fitted with US-type M1910 hooks. In addition, the Ephod's back panel has two and the chest/side panels four snap loops for attaching the \"Old style\" web pistol belt and two detachable [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] pouches.\n\nDesigned to be worn over a [[Flak jacket|flak vest]], the Ephod Combat Vest is usually worn rather high and it can be put on and off in one piece, like a jacket. Its magazine pouches can hold up to twelve [[M16 rifle|M16]], [[IMI Galil]] or [[AK-47]] series magazines, along with additional pouches for medical equipment, 7.62mm [[FN MAG]] machine gun belts, [[40 mm grenade|40mm rounds]] and attachments for packs.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 49.</ref> In addition, the asymmetrical arrangement of ammunition of the Ephod allows maximum comfort when in firing position, providing the soldier with an elbow rest when holding his rifle.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> These characteristics made the Ephod an ingenious and versatile system, adaptable to the various needs of modern combat troops,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> considered at the time by some specialists a revolutionary, imaginative design and the best in the world.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n====Second-model Ephod vest====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Late-model Ephod vest====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Armoured Corps Web Gear====\nWhen the Ephod was issued to [[Armored Corps (Israel)|IDF Armoured Corps]] crewmen in 1978, they found that the standard combat vest was very cumbersome while operating in the confines of an armoured vehicle, so a special set was developed. Based on the ChiCom [[AK-47]] chest rig, the '''Ephod HaShan''' or '''Ephod Heil HaShiryon''' (\"Armoured Corps web gear\") load-bearing equipment is a variation of the Ephod and consists of four frontal rectangular magazine chest pouches designed specifically for the \"sitting\" tank soldiers, complete with two regular pouches for rectangular canteens worn on either side.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 56.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Battleground Lebanon'' (1990), Plate A4.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israel's Cutting Edge'' (1990), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Tools of the Trade \u2013 The Weapons, Gear & Uniforms of the IDF'' (1991), Plate B3.</ref>\n\n====Advanced Ephod====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Combat use==\n\n===Israeli service===\nThe Ephod made its operational d\u00e9but during the famous [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in [[July 1976]]<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref><ref>Dunstan, ''Israel's Lighting Strike, The raid on Entebbe 1976'' (2009), p. 33.</ref> and was introduced the following year into Israeli forces,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 36.</ref>  though its massive use by Israeli troops came only during the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]]<ref>Russel & Katz, ''Israeli Defense Forces \u2013 1948 to the present'' (1985), p. 51.</ref><ref>Campbell & Dennis, ''Israeli Paratroopers 1954-2016'' (2018), p. 28.</ref> and the subsequent [[1982 Lebanon War|June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon]].<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\nThe Ephod also began to be marketed to foreign recipients of Israeli military aid in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the first [[Latin America]]n country to receive it was [[Nicaragua]] in 1977-78.<ref>Caballero Jurado & Thomas, ''Central American Wars 1959\u201389'' (1990), p. 44.</ref> With the adoption of Israeli-made small-arms in 1976, the [[Somoza family|Somoza Regime]] ordered substantial quantities of the Ephod to equip the elite and infantry units of its [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|Nicaraguan National Guard]]. Later during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|1978-79 Nicaraguan Revolution]], captured Ephod vests were also worn by [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) guerrillas.\n\n[[Guatemala]] also received the Ephod for the [[Armed Forces of Guatemala|Guatemalan Army]]'s Parachute Brigade and [[Kaibiles]], while [[Ecuador]] adopted it for its [[Ecuadorian Navy#Marines|Naval Infantry Corps]] troops and [[Peru]] acquired Ephod vests to equip its [[Peruvian Armed Forces|Army]] and [[Peruvian Naval Infantry|Naval Infantry]] units. [[Argentina]] also adopted the Ephod for the [[Argentine Army]]'s [[8th Mountain Cazadores Company]] of the [[8th Mountain Infantry Brigade (Argentina)|8th Mountain Infantry Brigade]].<ref>Rivet, ''La 8e Brigade de Montagne Argentine'' (1996), p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\nDuring the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the pro-Israeli militias in Lebanon, the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] (LF)<ref name=\"KVAL A\">Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), pp. 40-41.</ref><ref name=\"KVAAMEW2 A\">Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Micheletti and Debay, ''Liban \u2013 dix jours aux c\u0153ur des combats'' (1989), pp. 12; 33-38.</ref> and the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA)<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 38.</ref> also began to receive the Ephod in substantial quantities to equip their troops at the late 1970s, with captured examples eventually finding their way into the hands of militiamen from other Lebanese factions throughout the 1980s and 1990s.  Photographic evidence taken at the time do show the Israeli combat vest being used by fighters from the Christian [[Zgharta Liberation Army|Marada Brigade]], the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] [[Amal Movement]] and [[Hezbollah]],<ref name=\"MP ISLAA A\">Micheletti and Palmade, ''Israel-Palestine: L'appel aux armes'' (2000), pp. 69-73.</ref> the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] [[People's Liberation Army (Lebanon)|People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Lebanon|Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] (SSNP), the [[Lebanese Army]]<ref name=\"MD LDJAXDC A\">Micheletti and Debay, ''Liban \u2013 dix jours aux c\u0153ur des combats'' (1989), pp. 26-31.</ref> and even the [[Syrian Army]] [[Defense Companies (Syria)|Commando troops]] stationed in the Country. The vest proved so popular during the War that the Lebanese soon began producing an unlicensed local copy, which was adopted in the mid-1990s by the [[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese Army]] as standard web gear for its infantry troops<ref name=\"EA LZL A\">El-Assad, ''Landing Zone Lebanon'' (2007), p. 35.</ref> and elite forces, such as the [[Lebanese Commando Regiment]], the [[Counter-Sabotage Regiment]], the [[Lebanese Airborne Regiment]] and the [[Republican Guard (Lebanon)|Republican Guard Brigade]]. \n\nRecently, Lebanese-produced Ephod vests have been encountered among regular soldiers of the [[Syrian Army]] and their adversaries of the [[Free Syrian Army]] and other rebel factions currently engaged in the [[Syrian Civil War|ongoing civil war in Syria]].\n\n===Asia===\nThe [[Sri Lanka Army]] (SLA) adopted in the 1980s-1990s the Ephod for its infantry, commando and special forces units equipped with the [[AKM]] assault rifle, who battled the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) insurgency during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] (1983-2009).\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) began to introduce their own version of the Ephod, known as the '''Skeletal Battle Order (SBO)''', for its infantry units.<Ref>https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/singapore-couple-start-company-selling-miniature-figurines-of-saf-soldiers</ref><ref name=\"2017 ISSUE 243\">https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/content/dam/imindef_media_library/graphics/army/army_news/download_our_issues/2017/armynews_issue243.pdf</ref> Manufactured primarily by the [[Johsen Equipment Company]] of [[Singapore]], the early models were direct copies of the original Israeli combat vest, featuring four large magazine pouches capable of accommodating eight 30-round [[M16 rifle|M16S1 assault rifle]] magazines, two narrow side pouches meant to store pen flares, two hand grenade carriers, one smoke grenade carrier, and a small butt-pack with two smaller side pouches. Later models of the SBO combat vest replaced the metal size adjusters in the suspenders and side panels with plastic buckles, and featured larger magazine pouches designed to hold the new plastic magazines for the [[SAR 21]] assault rifle which were more voluminous than those of the M16S1. The Ephod-based SBO continued to be issued to SAF infantry battalions until 2006-2007, when it was replaced a new model of [[Individual Integrated Fighting System|Load bearing vest]] (LBV) based on the [[MOLLE]]/[[Pouch Attachment Ladder System]]s (PALS).\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[Italian Army]] adopted the Ephod in the early 1990s and issued it as standard web gear for the paratroopers of the [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Folgore Airborne Brigade]] deployed at the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in the cadre of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] on April\u2013July 1991.<ref name=\"Heraut A\">Heraut, ''Italian Army's new gear \u2013 ready for the next century'' (1992), pp. 32-36.</ref> The [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Incursori'') unit of the Folgore Brigade later employed the Ephod in combat when they participated in [[Operation Silver Back]] on April 1994, the joint multi-national effort to evacuate foreign nationals from [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]'s capital city, during the [[Rwandan Civil War]].<ref>Charlier, ''Rescuing Europeans from the Rwandan Civil War'' (1994), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe [[French Armed Forces]] elite units of the [[Special Operations Command (France)|Special Operations Command]] deployed to [[Rwanda]] in the cadre of [[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]] on June\u2013August 1994 were photographed wearing a unique set of Load Bearing Equipment remarkably similar in design to the Israeli Ephod Combat Vest.<ref name=\"COSR\">Micheletti, ''COS intervention in Rwanda'' (1994), pp. 42-47.</ref>\n\nThe [[Estonian Land Forces]] adopted in the mid-1990s a locally-designed set of Load Bearing Equipment inspired by the Ephod for its infantry units armed with the [[IMI Galil]] assault rifle.\n\nA number of Ephod vests were sent to the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1998 as aid from [[Israel]], subsequently being issued to the [[Special Police Units (Serbia)|Serbian Special Police Units]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. After the conflict, all the Ephod vests seem to have been transferred to the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)|Special Operations Unit]] of the former Yugoslavian [[State Security Service (FR Yugoslavia)|State Security Service]] (RDB), where they were mostly used for training purposes. Upon the disbandment of the Special Operations Unit, the fate of the Ephod vests becomes unknown; while some were seen being worn by the [[Gendarmery (Serbia)|Serbian Gendarmerie]], they were quickly retired from service and only a few examples remain in use.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

It replaced the modular-based 1950s \"Old style\" [[Tan (color)|tan]]-[[khaki]] cotton canvas equipment (similar in design to the [[British Army]]'s [[58 pattern webbing]]) and a variety of load-carrying waistcoats and assault vests used by Israeli infantry and elite units during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Six-Day War]], the [[War of Attrition|1967-1970 War of Attrition]], and the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]].<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref>\n\n==History and development==\nThe IDF load-bearing system or '''Ephod''' (\"apron\" or \"avantail\" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) is the direct result of the long experience acquired over the years with the \"commando web gear\" originally worn by [[Israeli special forces units|Israeli recon paratroopers]] during the War of Attrition, who made crude but comfortable Khaki or Olive Green waistcoats and assault vests incorporating many small canvas or [[Cordura|Nylon]] pouches.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 12.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Forces since 1948'' (1988), p. 57.</ref><ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref> Known as the \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment, the Ephod was designed by the Israeli private firm [[Rabintex Industries Ltd.]] of [[Herzeliya]] near [[Tel Aviv]] in 1975-76, who allegedly developed it from an American prototype.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 39.</ref>\n\n===Description===\nThe \"New style\" Load Bearing Equipment prototype presented in 1976 by Rabintex was made entirely of [[Olive (color)|olive green]] (OG) [[Cordura|Cordura-type nylon]] and consisted of wide unpadded shoulder straps or suspenders and an \"X\"-back harness or \"yoke\" system fitted with three chest/side and back panels fitted with a detachable [[Foam rubber|foam]]-padded waist-band or \"belt\", secured at the front by two strap-and-buckle attachment loops. One novel feature of the Ephod is that his yoke spread the weight to be borne over the shoulders and was not secured to a conventional waist belt. His suspenders were joined in the area of the shoulder-blades by a lateral piece to which was stitched a rectangular web loop with eyelets for attaching a [[Entrenching tool|U.S.-type entrenching tool]], a feature also found in the \"Old style\" web gear suspenders.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\nAnother feature of the Ephod was his wide cushioned waist-band fitted at the back of the panels by snap buttons, which distributed the weight well all around the waist. Many Israeli soldiers in the field had found the canvas material of the IDF standard issue \"Old style\" web gear and the load they carried to be very uncomfortable, and so wore padding underneath the pistol belt and waist pouches;<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), pp. 5; 52-53.</ref> this aspect was taken into consideration by the designers of the Ephod, who devised a unique system in which the ammunition pouches, the grenade carriers and other equipment rest on three [[Foam rubber|foam]] pads tied together by [[parachute cord]] lacing at four points, allowing infinite adjustment to individual size.<ref>D'Elia, ''Personal Load Carrying Equipment'' (1992), p. 38.</ref><ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> Like the front extremities of the yoke, they were not secured to the cushioned waist-band but to the pouches instead.\n\nThe pouches came in three sets, left, right, and back. Each consists of a nylon base panel, in which a total of nine integral nylon pouches of five different sizes, comprising four large magazine pouches, two individual [[hand grenade]] carriers, one [[smoke grenade]] carrier, one [[First aid kit]] pouch and one rear pouch for carrying [[binoculars]] or [[Night-vision device|night-vision equipment]] are stitched.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref> All pouch flaps are fitted with [[Velcro]] [[Hook-and-loop fastener]] strips reinforced by a single metal eyelet and the larger magazine pouches each had at the lower end a nylon frog with two eyelets for additional pouches fitted with US-type M1910 hooks. In addition, the Ephod's back panel has two and the chest/side panels four snap loops for attaching the \"Old style\" web pistol belt and two detachable [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]] pouches.\n\nDesigned to be worn over a [[Flak jacket|flak vest]], the Ephod Combat Vest is usually worn rather high and it can be put on and off in one piece, like a jacket. Its magazine pouches can hold up to twelve [[M16 rifle|M16]], [[IMI Galil]] or [[AK-47]] series magazines, along with additional pouches for medical equipment, 7.62mm [[FN MAG]] machine gun belts, [[40 mm grenade|40mm rounds]] and attachments for packs.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 49.</ref> In addition, the asymmetrical arrangement of ammunition of the Ephod allows maximum comfort when in firing position, providing the soldier with an elbow rest when holding his rifle.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> These characteristics made the Ephod an ingenious and versatile system, adaptable to the various needs of modern combat troops,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon 1982-84'' (1985), p. 36.</ref> considered at the time by some specialists a revolutionary, imaginative design and the best in the world.<ref>Laffin & Chappell, ''The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars 1948-73'' (1982), p. 38.</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n====Second-model Ephod vest====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Late-model Ephod vest====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Armoured Corps Web Gear====\nWhen the Ephod was issued to [[Armored Corps (Israel)|IDF Armoured Corps]] crewmen in 1978, they found that the standard combat vest was very cumbersome while operating in the confines of an armoured vehicle, so a special set was developed. Based on the ChiCom [[AK-47]] chest rig, the '''Ephod HaShan''' or '''Ephod Heil HaShiryon''' (\"Armoured Corps web gear\") load-bearing equipment is a variation of the Ephod and consists of four frontal rectangular magazine chest pouches designed specifically for the \"sitting\" tank soldiers, complete with two regular pouches for rectangular canteens worn on either side.<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Defense Forces since 1973'' (1990), p. 56.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Battleground Lebanon'' (1990), Plate A4.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israel's Cutting Edge'' (1990), p. 36.</ref><ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Tools of the Trade \u2013 The Weapons, Gear & Uniforms of the IDF'' (1991), Plate B3.</ref>\n\n====Advanced Ephod====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Combat use==\n\n===Israeli service===\nThe Ephod made its operational d\u00e9but during the famous [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in [[July 1976]]<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref><ref>Dunstan, ''Israel's Lighting Strike, The raid on Entebbe 1976'' (2009), p. 33.</ref> and was introduced the following year into Israeli forces,<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Arab Armies of the Middle East Wars 2'' (1988), p. 36.</ref>  though its massive use by Israeli troops came only during the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]]<ref>Russel & Katz, ''Israeli Defense Forces \u2013 1948 to the present'' (1985), p. 51.</ref><ref>Campbell & Dennis, ''Israeli Paratroopers 1954-2016'' (2018), p. 28.</ref> and the subsequent [[1982 Lebanon War|June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon]].<ref>Katz & Volstad, ''Israeli Elite Units since 1948'' (1988), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Latin America===\nThe Ephod also began to be marketed to foreign recipients of Israeli military aid in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the first [[Latin America]]n country to receive it was [[Nicaragua]] in 1977-78.<ref>Caballero Jurado & Thomas, ''Central American Wars 1959\u201389'' (1990), p. 44.</ref> With the adoption of Israeli-made small-arms in 1976, the [[Somoza family|Somoza Regime]] ordered substantial quantities of the Ephod to equip the elite and infantry units of its [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|Nicaraguan National Guard]]. Later during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|1978-79 Nicaraguan Revolution]], captured Ephod vests were also worn by [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) guerrillas.\n\n[[Guatemala]] also received the Ephod for the [[Armed Forces of Guatemala|Guatemalan Army]]'s Parachute Brigade and [[Kaibiles]], while [[Ecuador]] adopted it for its [[Ecuadorian Navy#Marines|Naval Infantry Corps]] troops and [[Peru]] acquired Ephod vests to equip its [[Peruvian Armed Forces|Army]] and [[Peruvian Naval Infantry|Naval Infantry]] units.

Later models of the SBO combat vest replaced the metal size adjusters in the suspenders and side panels with plastic buckles, and featured larger magazine pouches designed to hold the new plastic magazines for the [[SAR 21]] assault rifle which were more voluminous than those of the M16S1. The Ephod-based SBO continued to be issued to SAF infantry battalions until 2006-2007, when it was replaced a new model of [[Individual Integrated Fighting System|Load bearing vest]] (LBV) based on the [[MOLLE]]/[[Pouch Attachment Ladder System]]s (PALS).\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[Italian Army]] adopted the Ephod in the early 1990s and issued it as standard web gear for the paratroopers of the [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Folgore Airborne Brigade]] deployed at the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in the cadre of [[Operation Provide Comfort]] on April\u2013July 1991.<ref name=\"Heraut A\">Heraut, ''Italian Army's new gear \u2013 ready for the next century'' (1992), pp. 32-36.</ref> The [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Incursori'') unit of the Folgore Brigade later employed the Ephod in combat when they participated in [[Operation Silver Back]] on April 1994, the joint multi-national effort to evacuate foreign nationals from [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]]'s capital city, during the [[Rwandan Civil War]].<ref>Charlier, ''Rescuing Europeans from the Rwandan Civil War'' (1994), p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe [[French Armed Forces]] elite units of the [[Special Operations Command (France)|Special Operations Command]] deployed to [[Rwanda]] in the cadre of [[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]] on June\u2013August 1994 were photographed wearing a unique set of Load Bearing Equipment remarkably similar in design to the Israeli Ephod Combat Vest.<ref name=\"COSR\">Micheletti, ''COS intervention in Rwanda'' (1994), pp. 42-47.</ref>\n\nThe [[Estonian Land Forces]] adopted in the mid-1990s a locally-designed set of Load Bearing Equipment inspired by the Ephod for its infantry units armed with the [[IMI Galil]] assault rifle.\n\nA number of Ephod vests were sent to the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1998 as aid from [[Israel]], subsequently being issued to the [[Special Police Units (Serbia)|Serbian Special Police Units]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. After the conflict, all the Ephod vests seem to have been transferred to the [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)|Special Operations Unit]] of the former Yugoslavian [[State Security Service (FR Yugoslavia)|State Security Service]] (RDB), where they were mostly used for training purposes. Upon the disbandement of the Special Operations Unit, the fate of the Ephod vests becomes unknown; while some were seen being worn by the [[Gendarmery (Serbia)|Serbian Gendarmerie]], they were quickly retired from service and only a few examples remain in use.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|100px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the university after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|100px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|150px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

Koz\u00e1k cited his inability to work with the squad under such conditions as the primary reason, as about a third of the squad was involved, including players Koz\u00e1k described as crucial for the future of Slovak football, with Weiss among them. The President of [[Slovak Football Association|SFZ]], J\u00e1n Kov\u00e1\u010dik, had punished the players by withholding any financial rewards for any future nominations and performances with the national team, during the upcoming qualification cycle.

It was based on the cylinders of the [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[de Havilland Gipsy Major|Gipsy Major]] and went on to spawn a whole series of similar [[Aircraft engine|aero engine]]s that were still in common use until the 1980s.\n\nThe engines were of particular note for their exceptionally low cross-sectional area, a [[Drag (physics)|drag]]-reducing feature which made them ideal for the many [[Air racing|racing aircraft]] of that period. In 1934, the basic bronze-headed Gipsy Six, rated at 185 [[horsepower]] (138&nbsp;kW) at 2,100 rpm was modified for use in the [[de Havilland DH.88 Comet|DH.88 Comet]] air racer as the Gipsy Six \"R\" which produced 223 horsepower (166&nbsp;kW) at 2,400 rpm for takeoff. Many Gipsy Six engines remain in service powering vintage aircraft types today.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe [[De Havilland Engine Company|de Havilland]] company had hoped to produce a version of the basic engine capable of utilising a hydraulically actuated [[Variable-pitch propeller|variable-pitch]] (VP) [[Propeller (aircraft)|airscrew]] based on the American Hamilton \"Bracket-Type\" in time for the 1934 MacRobertson Race. Since there was so little time to perfect this installation, as a compromise, a French \"[[Ratier]]\" VP airscrew was fitted to the Comets' \"R\" engines, which utilised a simple air-filled bladder for a once-per-flight automatic pitch change. Later on, Comets were fitted with the Series II engine, which eliminated this crude system. Power for the \"R\" was increased to a takeoff rating of {{convert|223|hp|kW}} by increasing the [[compression ratio]]s from 5.25:1 to 6.5:1, while fitting [[aluminium]] alloy [[cylinder head]]s, domed-[[piston]]s and modified [[Poppet valve#Internal combustion engine|valve gear]]. Production of the basic fixed-pitch Gipsy Six unit began in 1935, with the engines rated at {{convert|200|hp|kW}} at 2,400 rpm for takeoff.\n\nThis was quickly followed by production of the {{convert|205|hp|kW}} Gipsy Six Series II for use with the hydraulically actuated airscrews that de Havilland were by then producing under a licence acquired from [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1934. This was effectively the engine that the company did not have time to develop for the 1934 MacRobertson race, but without the significant increase in compression-ratio needed for the Comet. The Series II unit, while superficially similar to its predecessor, utilised a hollow, splined [[crankshaft]] to permit the fitting of the VP airscrew utilising boosted pressurised oil from the engine's [[Dry sump|dry-sump]] [[lubrication]] system via a pilot-operated control valve. As well as differences to the [[crankcase]] and crankshaft, different cylinder barrels, pistons and aluminium cylinder heads were utilised. There was also an added, very limited ability provided on the Series II to run accessories. The \"pilot-friendly\" [[constant speed unit]]s (CSUs) were not available for these engines until 1939. The Series II was also equipped with AMC (Automatic Mixture Control) a [[barometric]] device, without which it was exceedingly difficult to adjust for a correct mixture with a CSU fitted. This feature was also carried over onto the similar [[de Havilland Gipsy Queen|Queen II]]. Pilots were then able to simply select the required RPM and Boost pressure required. This reduction in over-leaning also tended to extend the TBO (time between overhauls). The twin down-draught, [[Claudel-Hobson]] A.I.48 [[carburetter]]s were common to all these engines. The induction system was designed to automatically obviate the effects of carburetter icing - a dangerous problem that still plagues most piston engines in current worldwide use in 2008, more than 70 years later.\n\nAlfa Romeo built two engine types based on the Gipsy Six design, the [[Alfa Romeo 110]] and [[Alfa Romeo 115]].\n\n===Type history===\nThe series of engines proved to be reliable, and the [[time between overhaul]] (TBO) was more than doubled within a few years. The [[Achilles' heel]] of the earlier units, namely the lack of facilities for running ancillary items, an increasing requirement during the 1930s, was addressed later on the Queen engines.\n\nThese engines powered many, if not most of the racing and record-setting aircraft of the 1930s. The engines were subsequently developed into the similar [[de Havilland Gipsy Queen]] III and Queen II for military applications. Later developments, such as the postwar Queen 30 and Queen 70 series engines took the rated power from {{convert|185|hp|kW}} up to nearly {{convert|500|hp|kW}}, and, while being entirely new designs, still used all of the same basic configuration of the original Gipsy Six of the mid-1930s and were in use by operators such as the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Royal Navy]] (RN) until the 1980s.\n\nToday, with de Havilland having long disappeared, very few of these engines remain in use and only a few specialist facilities can carry out overhauls.\n\n==Variants==\n;Gipsy Six I\n:Bronze [[cylinder head]]s, 200hp.

It was based on the cylinders of the [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[de Havilland Gipsy Major|Gipsy Major]] and went on to spawn a whole series of similar [[Aircraft engine|aero engine]]s that were still in common use until the 1980s.\n\nThe engines were of particular note for their exceptionally low cross-sectional area, a [[Drag (physics)|drag]]-reducing feature which made them ideal for the many [[Air racing|racing aircraft]] of that period. In 1934, the basic bronze-headed Gipsy Six, rated at 185 [[horsepower]] (138&nbsp;kW) at 2,100 rpm was modified for use in the [[de Havilland DH.88 Comet|DH.88 Comet]] air racer as the Gipsy Six \"R\" which produced 223 horsepower (166&nbsp;kW) at 2,400 rpm for takeoff. Many Gipsy Six engines remain in service powering vintage aircraft types today.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe [[De Havilland Engine Company|de Havilland]] company had hoped to produce a version of the basic engine capable of utilising a hydraulically actuated [[Variable-pitch propeller|variable-pitch]] (VP) [[Propeller (aircraft)|airscrew]] based on the American Hamilton \"Bracket-Type\" in time for the 1934 MacRobertson Race. Since there was so little time to perfect this installation, as a compromise, a French \"[[Ratier]]\" VP airscrew was fitted to the Comets' \"R\" engines, which utilised a simple air-filled bladder for a once-per-flight automatic pitch change. Later on, Comets were fitted with the Series II engine, which eliminated this crude system. Power for the \"R\" was increased to a takeoff rating of {{convert|223|hp|kW}} by increasing the [[compression ratio]]s from 5.25:1 to 6.5:1, while fitting [[aluminium]] alloy [[cylinder head]]s, domed-[[piston]]s and modified [[Poppet valve#Internal combustion engine|valve gear]]. Production of the basic fixed-pitch Gipsy Six unit began in 1935, with the engines rated at {{convert|200|hp|kW}} at 2,400 rpm for takeoff.\n\nThis was quickly followed by production of the {{convert|205|hp|kW}} Gipsy Six Series II for use with the hydraulically actuated airscrews that de Havilland were by then producing under a licence acquired from [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1934. This was effectively the engine that the company did not have time to develop for the 1934 MacRobertson race, but without the significant increase in compression-ratio needed for the Comet. The Series II unit, while superficially similar to its predecessor, utilised a hollow, splined [[crankshaft]] to permit the fitting of the VP airscrew utilising boosted pressurised oil from the engine's [[Dry sump|dry-sump]] [[lubrication]] system via a pilot-operated control valve. As well as differences to the [[crankcase]] and crankshaft, different cylinder barrels, pistons and aluminium cylinder heads were utilised. There was also an added, very limited ability provided on the Series II to run accessories. The \"pilot-friendly\" [[constant speed unit]]s (CSUs) were not available for these engines until 1939. The Series II was also equipped with AMC (Automatic Mixture Control) a [[barometric]] device, without which it was exceedingly difficult to adjust for a correct mixture with a CSU fitted. This feature was also carried over onto the similar [[de Havilland Gipsy Queen|Queen II]]. Pilots were then able to simply select the required RPM and Boost pressure required. This reduction in over-leaning also tended to extend the TBO (time between overhauls). The twin down-draught, [[Claudel-Hobson]] A.I.48 [[carburetter]]s were common to all these engines. The induction system was designed to automatically obviate the effects of carburetter icing - a dangerous problem that still plagues most piston engines in current worldwide use in 2008, more than 70 years later.\n\nAlfa Romeo built two engine types based on the Gipsy Six design, the [[Alfa Romeo 110]] and [[Alfa Romeo 115]].\n\n===Type history===\nThe series of engines proved to be reliable, and the [[time between overhaul]] (TBO) was more than doubled within a few years. The [[Achilles' heel]] of the earlier units, namely the lack of facilities for running ancillary items, an increasing requirement during the 1930s, was addressed later on the Queen engines.\n\nThese engines powered many, if not most of the racing and record-setting aircraft of the 1930s. The engines were subsequently developed into the similar [[de Havilland Gipsy Queen]] III and Queen II for military applications. Later developments, such as the postwar Queen 30 and Queen 70 series engines took the rated power from {{convert|185|hp|kW}} up to nearly {{convert|500|hp|kW}}, and, while being entirely new designs, still used all of the same basic configuration of the original Gipsy Six of the mid-1930s and were in use by operators such as the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Royal Navy]] (RN) until the 1980s.\n\nToday, with de Havilland having long disappeared, very few of these engines remain in use and only a few specialist facilities can carry out overhauls.\n\n==Variants==\n;Gipsy Six I\n:Bronze [[cylinder head]]s, 200hp.

It is the first [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[16 and Pregnant]]'', and it focuses on the lives of several young mothers as they navigate motherhood and strained family and romantic relationships. Its first run consists of four seasons originally aired between December 8, 2009, and October 9, 2012, while another four seasons have aired during its second run that began on March 23, 2015.\n\nThe series originally focused on the lives of [[Maci Bookout]] (now McKinney), [[Catelynn Lowell]] (now Baltierra), [[Amber Portwood]], and [[Farrah Abraham]], who were featured on the first season of ''16 and Pregnant''. ''[[Are You the One?]]'' participant Cheyenne Floyd and television personality [[Bristol Palin]] joined in the second half of the seventh season replacing Abraham who departed from the show. However, Palin departed the show following an announcement on Instagram in April 2019. In August 2019, [[Mackenzie McKee]] from ''[[Teen Mom 3]]'' joined the cast as a guest mom for the last few episodes of season eight. Mackenzie McKee will officially be a main cast member on season 8B.\n\nThe show's success has allowed for the development of the spin-offs ''[[Teen Mom 2]]'', ''[[Teen Mom 3]]'', ''[[Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant]]'', and ''[[Teen Mom: Young Moms Club]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n===Farrah Abraham===\n{{main|Farrah Abraham}}\n\nAn aspiring model,<ref name=hearty/> Farrah Abraham (from [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]) is the mother of Sophia Laurent Abraham, whose father, Derek Underwood, was killed in a car accident on December 28, 2008, two months before her birth.\n\nIn January 2010, Farrah's mother, Debra Danielson, was charged with assault in an Iowa court for hitting her.<ref name=\"usmagazine.com\">{{cite news|title=Update: Mother of 'Teen Mom' Star Officially Charged with Assault|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=January 20, 2010|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/mother-of-teen-mom-star-officially-charged-with-assault-2010201|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> As a result of the fight with her mother, Farrah and Sophia moved out of her mother's house.\n\nShe started seeing a therapist to discuss the rocky relationship with her family, because she couldn't cope with her mothers actions as well as dealing with her emotions regarding Underwood and his death. Farrah eventually proved to Derek's family through a paternity test that Derek was in fact Sophia's father and then was faced with a lawsuit filed by Derek's mother for grandparents' visitation rights, despite no previous contact with Sophia.\n\nShe published her autobiography, ''[[My Teenage Dream Ended]]'' in August 2012. In May 2013, [[Vivid Entertainment]] released a sex tape featuring Abraham having sex with porn star [[James Deen]].

Its first run consists of four seasons originally aired between December 8, 2009, and October 9, 2012, while another four seasons have aired during its second run that began on March 23, 2015.\n\nThe series originally focused on the lives of [[Maci Bookout]] (now McKinney), [[Catelynn Lowell]] (now Baltierra), [[Amber Portwood]], and [[Farrah Abraham]], who were featured on the first season of ''16 and Pregnant''. ''[[Are You the One?]]'' participant Cheyenne Floyd and television personality [[Bristol Palin]] joined in the second half of the seventh season replacing Abraham who departed from the show. However, Palin departed the show following an announcement on Instagram in April 2019. In August 2019, [[Mackenzie McKee]] from ''[[Teen Mom 3]]'' joined the cast as a guest mom for the last few episodes of season eight. Mackenzie McKee will officially be a main cast member on season 8B.\n\nThe show's success has allowed for the development of the spin-offs ''[[Teen Mom 2]]'', ''[[Teen Mom 3]]'', ''[[Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant]]'', and ''[[Teen Mom: Young Moms Club]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n===Farrah Abraham===\n{{main|Farrah Abraham}}\n\nAn aspiring model,<ref name=hearty/> Farrah Abraham (from [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]) is the mother of Sophia Laurent Abraham, whose father, Derek Underwood, was killed in a car accident on December 28, 2008, two months before her birth.\n\nIn January 2010, Farrah's mother, Debra Danielson, was charged with assault in an Iowa court for hitting her.<ref name=\"usmagazine.com\">{{cite news|title=Update: Mother of 'Teen Mom' Star Officially Charged with Assault|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=January 20, 2010|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/mother-of-teen-mom-star-officially-charged-with-assault-2010201|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> As a result of the fight with her mother, Farrah and Sophia moved out of her mother's house.\n\nShe started seeing a therapist to discuss the rocky relationship with her family, because she couldn't cope with her mothers actions as well as dealing with her emotions regarding Underwood and his death. Farrah eventually proved to Derek's family through a paternity test that Derek was in fact Sophia's father and then was faced with a lawsuit filed by Derek's mother for grandparents' visitation rights, despite no previous contact with Sophia.\n\nShe published her autobiography, ''[[My Teenage Dream Ended]]'' in August 2012. In May 2013, [[Vivid Entertainment]] released a sex tape featuring Abraham having sex with porn star [[James Deen]].
