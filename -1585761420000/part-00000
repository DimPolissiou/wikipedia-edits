Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

The inverse quantity is '''{{vanchor|electrical conductance|CONDUCTANCE}}''', and is the ease with which an electric current passes.  Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical [[friction]]. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of electrical resistance is the [[ohm]] ([[Omega|\u03a9]]), while electrical conductance is measured in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (S).\n\nThe resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of. Objects made of [[electrical insulator]]s like [[rubber]] tend to have very high resistance and low conductivity, while objects made of [[electrical conductor]]s like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductivity. This relationship is quantified by [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity or conductivity]]. The nature of a material is not the only factor in resistance and conductance, however: it also depends on the size and shape of an object because the properties are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive rather than intensive properties]]. For example, a wire's resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. All objects resist electrical current, except for [[superconductor]]s, which have a resistance of zero.\n\nThe resistance ''R'' of an object is defined as the ratio of [[voltage]] ''U'' across it to [[electric current|current]] ''I'' through it, while the conductance ''G'' is the reciprocal:\n:<math>R = {U\\over I}, \\qquad G = {I\\over U} = \\frac{1}{R}</math>\n\nFor a wide variety of materials and conditions, ''U'' and ''I'' are directly proportional to each other, and therefore ''R'' and ''G'' are [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] (although they will depend on the size and shape of the object, the material it is made of, and other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials that satisfy it are called ''ohmic'' materials.\n\nIn other cases, such as a [[transformer]], [[diode]] or [[battery (electricity)|battery]], ''U'' and ''I'' are ''not'' directly proportional. The ratio ''U'' over ''I'' is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a \"chordal resistance\" or \"static resistance\",<ref name=brown>{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

When a pipe (left) is filled with hair (right), it takes a larger pressure to achieve the same flow of water. Pushing electric current through a large resistance is like pushing water through a pipe clogged with hair: It requires a larger push ([[electromotive force]]) to drive the same flow ([[electric current]]).]]\n\nIn the [[hydraulic analogy]], current flowing through a wire (or [[resistor]]) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the [[voltage drop]] across the wire is like the [[pressure drop]] that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. (Conductance and resistance are [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]].)\n\nThe [[voltage drop]] (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the [[voltage]] itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: The pressure difference between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)\n\nThe resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:\n* geometry (shape), and\n* material\n\nGeometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.\n\nMaterials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, [[electron]]s can flow freely and easily through a [[copper]] wire, but cannot flow as easily through a [[steel]] wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] like [[rubber]], regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and [[electron configuration]], and is quantified by a property called [[resistivity]].\n\nIn addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Conductors and resistors==\n[[File:Metal film resistor.jpg|thumb|250px|A 75 \u03a9 [[resistor]], as identified by its [[electronic color code]] (violet\u2013green\u2013black\u2013gold\u2013red). <!-- This resistor uses the 4 band variant of the colour code so the bands represent 7 - 5 - 0 - x0.1</sup> making 75 \u03a9 ---> An [[ohmmeter]] could be used to verify this value.]]\n\nSubstances in which electricity can flow are called [[electrical conductor|conductors]]. A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a [[resistor]]. Conductors are made of high-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.\n\n==Ohm's law==\n{{main|Ohm's law}}\n[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|500px|The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The horizontal axis is [[voltage drop]], the vertical axis is [[electric current|current]]. Ohm's law is satisfied when the graph is a straight line through the origin. Therefore, the two resistors are ''ohmic'', but the diode and battery are not.]]\n\nFor many materials, the current ''I'' through the material is proportional to the voltage ''U'' applied across it:\n:<math>I \\propto U</math>\nover a wide range of voltages and currents.  Therefore, the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. This relationship is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials which obey it are called ''ohmic'' materials.  Examples of ohmic components are wires and [[resistor]]s. The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage graph]] of an ohmic device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive [[slope (mathematics)|slope]].\n\nOther components and materials used in electronics do not obey Ohm's law; the current is not proportional to the voltage, so the resistance varies with the voltage and current through them.  These are called ''nonlinear'' or ''nonohmic''. Examples include [[diode]]s and [[fluorescent lamp]]s.  The current-voltage curve of a nonohmic device is a curved line.\n\n== Relation to resistivity and conductivity ==\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]\n\nThe resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: What material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|R}} and conductance {{math|G}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  R &= \\rho \\frac{\\ell}{A}, \\\\[5pt]\n  G &= \\sigma \\frac{A}{\\ell}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ell</math> is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s (m), ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s (m\u00b2), \u03c3 ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>), and \u03c1 ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (\u03a9\u00b7m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: <math>\\rho=1/\\sigma</math>. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.\n\nThis formula is not exact, as it assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.\n\nAnother situation for which this formula is not exact is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],<ref>Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', pp. 17\u201319</ref> or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.\n\nThe resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of [[PTFE|teflon]] is about 10<sup>30</sup> times lower than the conductivity of copper. Loosely speaking, this is because metals have large numbers of \"delocalized\" electrons that are not stuck in any one place, so they are free to move across large distances. In an insulator, such as Teflon, each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule so a great force is required to pull it away. [[Semiconductor]]s lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]]. For the case of [[electrolyte]] solutions, see the article: [[Conductivity (electrolytic)]].\n\nResistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Measuring resistance==\n{{main|Ohmmeter}}\n\nAn instrument for measuring resistance is called an [[ohmmeter]].  Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use [[four-terminal sensing]].\n\n==Typical resistances==\n{{see also|Electrical resistivities of the elements (data page)|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These are called ''non-ohmic'' or ''non-linear'', and their [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage curves]] are ''not'' straight lines through the origin.\n\nResistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements. However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its [[Biasing|operating point]]. There are two types of resistance:<ref name=brown/><ref name=kaiser/>\n\n{{glossary start}}\n{{term|Static resistance (also called ''chordal'' or ''DC resistance'')}}{{defn|This corresponds to the usual definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{static} = \\frac {U}{I} \\,</math>.\n\nIt is the slope of the line ([[chord (geometry)|chord]]) from the origin through the point on the curve. Static resistance determines the power dissipation in an electrical component. Points on the current\u2013voltage curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which the slope of the chordal line is negative, have ''negative static resistance''. [[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance. However active devices such as transistors or [[op-amp]]s can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as [[gyrator]]s.\n}}\n{{term|Differential resistance (also called ''dynamic'', ''incremental'' or ''small signal resistance'')}}{{defn|[[Electrical resistance#Static and differential resistance|Differential resistance]] is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the [[slope]] of the current\u2013voltage curve at a point\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{diff} = \\frac {dU}{dI}  \\,</math>.\n\nIf the current\u2013voltage curve is non[[monotonic]] (with peaks and troughs), the curve has a negative slope in some regions\u2014so in these regions the device has ''[[negative differential resistance]]''.  Devices with negative differential resistance can amplify a signal applied to them, and are used to make amplifiers and oscillators.  These include [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s, [[magnetron]] tubes, and [[unijunction transistor]]s.\n}}\n{{glossary end}}\n\n==AC circuits==\n===Impedance and admittance===\n{{main|Electrical impedance|Admittance}}\n\nWhen an alternating current flows through a circuit, the relation between current and voltage across a circuit element is characterized not only by the ratio of their magnitudes, but also the difference in their [[Phase (waves)|phases]]. For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]], the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90\u00b0 out of phase, see image below). [[Complex number]]s are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:\n:<math>u(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(U_0 \\cdot e^{j\\omega t}\\right), \\quad i(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(I_0 \\cdot e^{j(\\omega t + \\varphi)}\\right), \\quad \\underline{Z} = \\frac{\\underline{U}}{\\underline{I}}, \\quad \\underline{Y} = \\frac{\\underline{I}}{\\underline{U}}</math>\n\n[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|300px|The voltage (red) and current (blue) versus time (horizontal axis) for a [[capacitor]] (top) and [[inductor]] (bottom). Since the [[amplitude]] of the current and voltage [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] are the same, the [[absolute value]] of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is 1 for both the capacitor and the inductor (in whatever units the graph is using). On the other hand, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is \u221290\u00b0 for the capacitor; therefore, the [[argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of the capacitor is \u221290\u00b0. Similarly, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is +90\u00b0 for the inductor; therefore, the complex phase of the impedance of the inductor is +90\u00b0.]]\n\nwhere:\n* ''t'' is time,\n* ''u(t)'' and ''i(t)'' are, respectively, voltage and current as a function of time,\n* ''U<sub>0</sub>'' and ''I<sub>0</sub>'' indicate the amplitude of voltage respective current,\n* <math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the AC current,\n* <math>\\varphi</math> is the displacement angle,\n* <u>''U''</u>, <u>''I''</u>, <u>''Z''</u>, and <u>''Y''</u> are complex numbers,\n* <u>''Z''</u> is called [[electrical impedance|impedance]],\n* <u>''Y''</u> is called [[admittance]],\n* Re indicates [[real part]],\n* <math>j=\\sqrt{-1}</math> is the [[imaginary unit]].\n\nThe impedance and admittance may be expressed as complex numbers that can be broken into real and imaginary parts:\n:<math>\\underline{Z} = R + jX, \\quad \\underline{Y} = G + jB</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' and ''G'' are resistance and conductance respectively, ''X'' is [[electrical reactance|reactance]], and ''B'' is [[susceptance]]. For ideal resistors, <u>''Z''</u> and <u>''Y''</u> reduce to ''R'' and ''G'' respectively, but for AC networks containing [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s, ''X'' and ''B'' are nonzero.\n\n<math>\\underline{Z} = 1/\\underline{Y}</math> for AC circuits, just as <math>R = 1/G</math> for DC circuits.\n\n===Frequency dependence of resistance===\nA key feature of AC circuits is that the resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent, a phenomenon known as the [[universal dielectric response]] <ref>{{cite journal|title=Stress-dependent electrical transport and its universal scaling in granular materials |journal=Extreme Mechanics Letters |volume=22 |pages=83\u201388 |doi=10.1016/j.eml.2018.05.005 |year=2018 |last1=Zhai |first1=Chongpu |last2=Gan |first2=Yixiang |last3=Hanaor |first3=Dorian |last4=Proust |first4=Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle |arxiv=1712.05938 }}</ref>. One reason, mentioned above is the [[skin effect]] (and the related [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see [[Drude model]], [[deep-level trap]]s, [[resonant frequency]], [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relations]], etc.)\n\n==Energy dissipation and Joule heating==\n{{main|Joule heating}}\n[[File:Cartridge-heater-hot.jpg|thumb|Running current through a material with high resistance creates heat, in a phenomenon called [[Joule heating]]. In this picture, a [[cartridge heater]], warmed by Joule heating, is [[Incandescence|glowing red hot]].]]\n\nResistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called ''[[Joule heating]]'' (after [[James Prescott Joule]]), also called ''ohmic heating'' or ''resistive heating''.\n\nThe dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of [[electric power transmission|transmission losses]] in [[overhead power line|power lines]]. [[Electric power transmission|High voltage transmission]] helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.\n\nOn the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in [[electric stove]]s and other [[electric heating|electric heaters]] (also called ''resistive heaters''). As another example, [[incandescent lamp]]s rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows \"white hot\" with [[thermal radiation]] (also called [[incandescence]]).\n\nThe formula for Joule heating is:\n:<math>P=I^2R</math>\nwhere ''P'' is the [[electric power|power]] (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, ''R'' is the resistance, and ''I'' is the current through the resistor.\n\n== Dependence of resistance on other conditions ==\n\n=== Temperature dependence ===\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Temperature dependence}}\nNear room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]].\n\nAs a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a [[resistance thermometer]] or [[thermistor]]. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)\n\nResistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as [[thermometer]]s: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with [[Joule heating]] (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], or for [[feedback]] in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a [[nonlinear element|nonlinear]] and [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] circuit element. For more details see [[Thermistor#Self-heating effects]].\n\nIf the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:\n:<math>R(T) = R_0[1+\\alpha (T - T_0)]</math>\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistance'', <math>T_0</math> is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and <math>R_0</math> is the resistance at temperature <math>T_0</math>. The parameter <math>\\alpha</math> is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, <math>\\alpha</math> is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that <math>\\alpha</math> was measured at with a suffix, such as <math>\\alpha_{15}</math>, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.<ref>Ward, MR, ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 36\u201340, McGraw-Hill, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe temperature coefficient <math>\\alpha</math> is typically +3\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> to +6\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.<ref>See [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for a table. The temperature coefficient of resistivity is similar but not identical to the temperature coefficient of resistance. The small difference is due to [[thermal expansion]] changing the dimensions of the resistor.</ref>\n\n=== Strain dependence ===\n{{main|Strain gauge}}\nJust as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. By placing a conductor under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (a form of [[stress (physics)|stress]] that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under [[Compression (physics)|compression]] (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on [[strain gauge]]s for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.\n\n=== Light illumination dependence ===\n{{main|Photoresistor|Photoconductivity}}\nSome resistors, particularly those made from [[semiconductor]]s, exhibit ''[[photoconductivity]]'', meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called ''[[photoresistor]]s'' (or ''light dependent resistors''). These are a common type of [[photodetector|light detector]].\n\n==Superconductivity==\n{{main|Superconductivity}}\n[[Superconductor]]s are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have V = 0 and I \u2260 0. This also means there is no [[joule heating]], or in other words no [[dissipation]] of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near 4{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid helium]] for most metallic superconductors like [[niobium\u2013tin]] alloys, or cooling to temperatures near 77{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid nitrogen]] for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic [[high temperature superconductors]].\nNevertheless, there are many [[technological applications of superconductivity]], including [[superconducting magnet]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Conductance quantum]]\n** [[Von Klitzing constant]] (its reciprocal)\n* [[Electrical measurements]]\n* [[Contact resistance]]\n* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for more information about the physical mechanisms for conduction in materials.\n* [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]]\n* [[Quantum Hall effect]], a standard for high-accuracy resistance measurements.\n* [[Resistor]]\n* [[RKM code]]\n* [[Series and parallel circuits]]\n* [[Sheet resistance]]\n* [[SI electromagnetism units]]\n* [[Thermal resistance]]\n* [[Voltage divider]]\n* [[Voltage drop]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100711132344/http://www.cvel.clemson.edu/emc/calculators/Resistance_Calculator/index.html''Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory: Resistance Calculator'']\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ElectronConductanceModelsUsingMaximalEntropyRandomWalks/ Electron Conductance Models Using Maximal Entropy Random Walks] Wolfram Demonstrantions Project\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrical Resistance}}\n[[Category:Electrical resistance and conductance| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|specific applications of conductivity and resistivity in electrical elements|other types of conductivity|Conductivity (disambiguation){{!}}Conductivity|electrical conductivity in general|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n{{Redirect|Resistive|the term used when referring to touchscreens|Resistive touchscreen}}\n{{Electromagnetism|Network}}\nThe '''electrical resistance''' of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. The inverse quantity is '''{{vanchor|electrical conductance|CONDUCTANCE}}''', and is the ease with which an electric current passes.  Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical [[friction]]. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of electrical resistance is the [[ohm]] ([[Omega|\u03a9]]), while electrical conductance is measured in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (S).\n\nThe resistance of an object depends in large part on the material it is made of. Objects made of [[electrical insulator]]s like [[rubber]] tend to have very high resistance and low conductivity, while objects made of [[electrical conductor]]s like metals tend to have very low resistance and high conductivity. This relationship is quantified by [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity or conductivity]]. The nature of a material is not the only factor in its resistance and conductance, however: it also depends on the size and shape of an object because the properties are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive rather than intensive properties]]. For example, a wire's resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. All objects resist electrical current, except for [[superconductor]]s, which have a resistance of zero.\n\nThe resistance ''R'' of an object is defined as the ratio of [[voltage]] ''U'' across it to [[electric current|current]] ''I'' through it, while the conductance ''G'' is the reciprocal:\n:<math>R = {U\\over I}, \\qquad G = {I\\over U} = \\frac{1}{R}</math>\n\nFor a wide variety of materials and conditions, ''U'' and ''I'' are directly proportional to each other, and therefore ''R'' and ''G'' are [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] (although they will depend on the size and shape of the object, the material it is made of, and other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials that satisfy it are called ''ohmic'' materials.\n\nIn other cases, such as a [[transformer]], [[diode]] or [[battery (electricity)|battery]], ''U'' and ''I'' are ''not'' directly proportional. The ratio ''U'' over ''I'' is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a \"chordal resistance\" or \"static resistance\",<ref name=brown>{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

When a pipe (left) is filled with hair (right), it takes a larger pressure to achieve the same flow of water. Pushing electric current through a large resistance is like pushing water through a pipe clogged with hair: It requires a larger push ([[electromotive force]]) to drive the same flow ([[electric current]]).]]\n\nIn the [[hydraulic analogy]], current flowing through a wire (or [[resistor]]) is like water flowing through a pipe, and the [[voltage drop]] across the wire is like the [[pressure drop]] that pushes water through the pipe. Conductance is proportional to how much flow occurs for a given pressure, and resistance is proportional to how much pressure is required to achieve a given flow. (Conductance and resistance are [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]].)\n\nThe [[voltage drop]] (i.e., difference between voltages on one side of the resistor and the other), not the [[voltage]] itself, provides the driving force pushing current through a resistor. In hydraulics, it is similar: The pressure difference between two sides of a pipe, not the pressure itself, determines the flow through it. For example, there may be a large water pressure above the pipe, which tries to push water down through the pipe. But there may be an equally large water pressure below the pipe, which tries to push water back up through the pipe. If these pressures are equal, no water flows. (In the image at right, the water pressure below the pipe is zero.)\n\nThe resistance and conductance of a wire, resistor, or other element is mostly determined by two properties:\n* geometry (shape), and\n* material\n\nGeometry is important because it is more difficult to push water through a long, narrow pipe than a wide, short pipe. In the same way, a long, thin copper wire has higher resistance (lower conductance) than a short, thick copper wire.\n\nMaterials are important as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts the flow of water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, [[electron]]s can flow freely and easily through a [[copper]] wire, but cannot flow as easily through a [[steel]] wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] like [[rubber]], regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and [[electron configuration]], and is quantified by a property called [[resistivity]].\n\nIn addition to geometry and material, there are various other factors that influence resistance and conductance, such as temperature; see [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Conductors and resistors==\n[[File:Metal film resistor.jpg|thumb|250px|A 75 \u03a9 [[resistor]], as identified by its [[electronic color code]] (violet\u2013green\u2013black\u2013gold\u2013red). <!-- This resistor uses the 4 band variant of the colour code so the bands represent 7 - 5 - 0 - x0.1</sup> making 75 \u03a9 ---> An [[ohmmeter]] could be used to verify this value.]]\n\nSubstances in which electricity can flow are called [[electrical conductor|conductors]]. A piece of conducting material of a particular resistance meant for use in a circuit is called a [[resistor]]. Conductors are made of high-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] materials such as metals, in particular copper and aluminium. Resistors, on the other hand, are made of a wide variety of materials depending on factors such as the desired resistance, amount of energy that it needs to dissipate, precision, and costs.\n\n==Ohm's law==\n{{main|Ohm's law}}\n[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|500px|The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The horizontal axis is [[voltage drop]], the vertical axis is [[electric current|current]]. Ohm's law is satisfied when the graph is a straight line through the origin. Therefore, the two resistors are ''ohmic'', but the diode and battery are not.]]\n\nFor many materials, the current ''I'' through the material is proportional to the voltage ''U'' applied across it:\n:<math>I \\propto U</math>\nover a wide range of voltages and currents.  Therefore, the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. This relationship is called [[Ohm's law]], and materials which obey it are called ''ohmic'' materials.  Examples of ohmic components are wires and [[resistor]]s. The [[current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage graph]] of an ohmic device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive [[slope (mathematics)|slope]].\n\nOther components and materials used in electronics do not obey Ohm's law; the current is not proportional to the voltage, so the resistance varies with the voltage and current through them.  These are called ''nonlinear'' or ''nonohmic''. Examples include [[diode]]s and [[fluorescent lamp]]s.  The current-voltage curve of a nonohmic device is a curved line.\n\n== Relation to resistivity and conductivity ==\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]\n\nThe resistance of a given object depends primarily on two factors: What material it is made of, and its shape. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area; for example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|R}} and conductance {{math|G}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  R &= \\rho \\frac{\\ell}{A}, \\\\[5pt]\n  G &= \\sigma \\frac{A}{\\ell}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ell</math> is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s (m), ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s (m\u00b2), \u03c3 ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>), and \u03c1 ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (\u03a9\u00b7m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: <math>\\rho=1/\\sigma</math>. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.\n\nThis formula is not exact, as it assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situations. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.\n\nAnother situation for which this formula is not exact is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. For this reason, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],<ref>Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', pp. 17\u201319</ref> or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.\n\nThe resistivity of different materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of [[PTFE|teflon]] is about 10<sup>30</sup> times lower than the conductivity of copper. Loosely speaking, this is because metals have large numbers of \"delocalized\" electrons that are not stuck in any one place, so they are free to move across large distances. In an insulator, such as Teflon, each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule so a great force is required to pull it away. [[Semiconductor]]s lie between these two extremes. More details can be found in the article: [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]]. For the case of [[electrolyte]] solutions, see the article: [[Conductivity (electrolytic)]].\n\nResistivity varies with temperature. In semiconductors, resistivity also changes when exposed to light. See [[#Dependence of resistance on other conditions|below]].\n\n==Measuring resistance==\n{{main|Ohmmeter}}\n\nAn instrument for measuring resistance is called an [[ohmmeter]].  Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because the resistance of their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use [[four-terminal sensing]].\n\n==Typical resistances==\n{{see also|Electrical resistivities of the elements (data page)|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These are called ''non-ohmic'' or ''non-linear'', and their [[Current\u2013voltage characteristic|current\u2013voltage curves]] are ''not'' straight lines through the origin.\n\nResistance and conductance can still be defined for non-ohmic elements. However, unlike ohmic resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its [[Biasing|operating point]]. There are two types of resistance:<ref name=brown/><ref name=kaiser/>\n\n{{glossary start}}\n{{term|Static resistance (also called ''chordal'' or ''DC resistance'')}}{{defn|This corresponds to the usual definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{static} = \\frac {U}{I} \\,</math>.\n\nIt is the slope of the line ([[chord (geometry)|chord]]) from the origin through the point on the curve. Static resistance determines the power dissipation in an electrical component. Points on the current\u2013voltage curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which the slope of the chordal line is negative, have ''negative static resistance''. [[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have negative static resistance. However active devices such as transistors or [[op-amp]]s can synthesize negative static resistance with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as [[gyrator]]s.\n}}\n{{term|Differential resistance (also called ''dynamic'', ''incremental'' or ''small signal resistance'')}}{{defn|[[Electrical resistance#Static and differential resistance|Differential resistance]] is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the [[slope]] of the current\u2013voltage curve at a point\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{diff} = \\frac {dU}{dI}  \\,</math>.\n\nIf the current\u2013voltage curve is non[[monotonic]] (with peaks and troughs), the curve has a negative slope in some regions\u2014so in these regions the device has ''[[negative differential resistance]]''.

For example, in an ideal resistor, the moment when the voltage reaches its maximum, the current also reaches its maximum (current and voltage are oscillating in phase). But for a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]], the maximum current flow occurs as the voltage passes through zero and vice versa (current and voltage are oscillating 90\u00b0 out of phase, see image below). [[Complex number]]s are used to keep track of both the phase and magnitude of current and voltage:\n:<math>u(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(U_0 \\cdot e^{j\\omega t}\\right), \\quad i(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(I_0 \\cdot e^{j(\\omega t + \\varphi)}\\right), \\quad \\underline{Z} = \\frac{\\underline{U}}{\\underline{I}}, \\quad \\underline{Y} = \\frac{\\underline{I}}{\\underline{U}}</math>\n\n[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|300px|The voltage (red) and current (blue) versus time (horizontal axis) for a [[capacitor]] (top) and [[inductor]] (bottom). Since the [[amplitude]] of the current and voltage [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] are the same, the [[absolute value]] of [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is 1 for both the capacitor and the inductor (in whatever units the graph is using). On the other hand, the [[phase (waves)|phase difference]] between current and voltage is \u221290\u00b0 for the capacitor; therefore, the [[argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of the capacitor is \u221290\u00b0.

One reason, mentioned above is the [[skin effect]] (and the related [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]). Another reason is that the resistivity itself may depend on frequency (see [[Drude model]], [[deep-level trap]]s, [[resonant frequency]], [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relations]], etc.)\n\n==Energy dissipation and Joule heating==\n{{main|Joule heating}}\n[[File:Cartridge-heater-hot.jpg|thumb|Running current through a material with high resistance creates heat, in a phenomenon called [[Joule heating]]. In this picture, a [[cartridge heater]], warmed by Joule heating, is [[Incandescence|glowing red hot]].]]\n\nResistors (and other elements with resistance) oppose the flow of electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called ''[[Joule heating]]'' (after [[James Prescott Joule]]), also called ''ohmic heating'' or ''resistive heating''.\n\nThe dissipation of electrical energy is often undesired, particularly in the case of [[electric power transmission|transmission losses]] in [[overhead power line|power lines]]. [[Electric power transmission|High voltage transmission]] helps reduce the losses by reducing the current for a given power.\n\nOn the other hand, Joule heating is sometimes useful, for example in [[electric stove]]s and other [[electric heating|electric heaters]] (also called ''resistive heaters''). As another example, [[incandescent lamp]]s rely on Joule heating: the filament is heated to such a high temperature that it glows \"white hot\" with [[thermal radiation]] (also called [[incandescence]]).\n\nThe formula for Joule heating is:\n:<math>P=I^2R</math>\nwhere ''P'' is the [[electric power|power]] (energy per unit time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy, ''R'' is the resistance, and ''I'' is the current through the resistor.\n\n== Dependence of resistance on other conditions ==\n\n=== Temperature dependence ===\n{{main|Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Temperature dependence}}\nNear room temperature, the resistivity of metals typically increases as temperature is increased, while the resistivity of semiconductors typically decreases as temperature is increased. The resistivity of insulators and electrolytes may increase or decrease depending on the system. For the detailed behavior and explanation, see [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]].\n\nAs a consequence, the resistance of wires, resistors, and other components often change with temperature. This effect may be undesired, causing an electronic circuit to malfunction at extreme temperatures. In some cases, however, the effect is put to good use. When temperature-dependent resistance of a component is used purposefully, the component is called a [[resistance thermometer]] or [[thermistor]]. (A resistance thermometer is made of metal, usually platinum, while a thermistor is made of ceramic or polymer.)\n\nResistance thermometers and thermistors are generally used in two ways. First, they can be used as [[thermometer]]s: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, they can be used in conjunction with [[Joule heating]] (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components can be used in a circuit-protection role similar to [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], or for [[feedback]] in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a [[nonlinear element|nonlinear]] and [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] circuit element. For more details see [[Thermistor#Self-heating effects]].\n\nIf the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:\n:<math>R(T) = R_0[1+\\alpha (T - T_0)]</math>\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistance'', <math>T_0</math> is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and <math>R_0</math> is the resistance at temperature <math>T_0</math>. The parameter <math>\\alpha</math> is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, <math>\\alpha</math> is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that <math>\\alpha</math> was measured at with a suffix, such as <math>\\alpha_{15}</math>, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.<ref>Ward, MR, ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 36\u201340, McGraw-Hill, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe temperature coefficient <math>\\alpha</math> is typically +3\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> to +6\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup> K<sup>\u22121</sup> for metals near room temperature. It is usually negative for semiconductors and insulators, with highly variable magnitude.<ref>See [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for a table. The temperature coefficient of resistivity is similar but not identical to the temperature coefficient of resistance. The small difference is due to [[thermal expansion]] changing the dimensions of the resistor.</ref>\n\n=== Strain dependence ===\n{{main|Strain gauge}}\nJust as the resistance of a conductor depends upon temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends upon [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. By placing a conductor under [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] (a form of [[stress (physics)|stress]] that leads to strain in the form of stretching of the conductor), the length of the section of conductor under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section of conductor. Under [[Compression (physics)|compression]] (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section of conductor decreases. See the discussion on [[strain gauge]]s for details about devices constructed to take advantage of this effect.\n\n=== Light illumination dependence ===\n{{main|Photoresistor|Photoconductivity}}\nSome resistors, particularly those made from [[semiconductor]]s, exhibit ''[[photoconductivity]]'', meaning that their resistance changes when light is shining on them. Therefore, they are called ''[[photoresistor]]s'' (or ''light dependent resistors''). These are a common type of [[photodetector|light detector]].\n\n==Superconductivity==\n{{main|Superconductivity}}\n[[Superconductor]]s are materials that have exactly zero resistance and infinite conductance, because they can have V = 0 and I \u2260 0. This also means there is no [[joule heating]], or in other words no [[dissipation]] of electrical energy. Therefore, if superconductive wire is made into a closed loop, current flows around the loop forever. Superconductors require cooling to temperatures near 4{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid helium]] for most metallic superconductors like [[niobium\u2013tin]] alloys, or cooling to temperatures near 77{{nbsp}}K with [[liquid nitrogen]] for the expensive, brittle and delicate ceramic [[high temperature superconductors]].\nNevertheless, there are many [[technological applications of superconductivity]], including [[superconducting magnet]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Conductance quantum]]\n** [[Von Klitzing constant]] (its reciprocal)\n* [[Electrical measurements]]\n* [[Contact resistance]]\n* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]] for more information about the physical mechanisms for conduction in materials.\n* [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]]\n* [[Quantum Hall effect]], a standard for high-accuracy resistance measurements.\n* [[Resistor]]\n* [[RKM code]]\n* [[Series and parallel circuits]]\n* [[Sheet resistance]]\n* [[SI electromagnetism units]]\n* [[Thermal resistance]]\n* [[Voltage divider]]\n* [[Voltage drop]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100711132344/http://www.cvel.clemson.edu/emc/calculators/Resistance_Calculator/index.html''Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory: Resistance Calculator'']\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ElectronConductanceModelsUsingMaximalEntropyRandomWalks/ Electron Conductance Models Using Maximal Entropy Random Walks] Wolfram Demonstrantions Project\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrical Resistance}}\n[[Category:Electrical resistance and conductance| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]\n", "name_user": "Batard0", "label": "safe", "comment": "Delete unnecessary word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"}

Their adherents have a pluralistic and overlapping tradition that makes precise definition of the political ideology difficult or impossible, compounded by a lack of common features, differing priorities of subgroups, lack of academic acceptance, and contentious, historical usage.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\"Anarchism\" generally refers to the anti-authoritarian (libertarian<!--{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=103}}-->) wing of the socialist movement.{{efn|name=\u24b6 is libsoc}} \"Libertarian socialism\" has been a synonym for \"anarchism\" since 1890,{{sfn|Cohn|2009|p=4}} as has the term \"libertarian\" through the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Cohn|2009|p=6}}<!--more: {{efn|name=synonymous}}-->\n\n<!-- explain briefly: why is anarchism/libertarianism hard to define? -->The terms \"anarchism\"<!--{{sfn|Miller|1984|p=2}}?--> and \"libertarianism\" represent broad political ideologies with multiple historical and contemporary meanings.{{sfn|Miller|1984|p=2}}{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=102}}<!-- \"loose terms\" encompassing too much{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|pp=226\u2013227}}--> Incompatibilities within their pluralistic tradition prove difficult or impossible to reconcile into a singular set of core beliefs.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=56}}<!-- source could be better--> The range of ideological disparities within anarchism is often paradoxical and never fully coherent.{{sfn|Miller|1984|pp=2\u20133}} \n\n<!-- other factors in defining anarchism/libertarianism -->Other complicating factors in defining \"anarchism\" include disagreement over its status as a political ideology and contention over the term's historical usage.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385\u2013386}} Anarchism's rejection of the state and state policy largely sits outside the purview of political scientists and in some formulations, its misconstruction as the antithesis of politics contributes to its marginalization as a political ideology.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=385}}\n\n== History of usage ==\n\n<!-- \"libertarian\" usage -->Since the 19th century, \"libertarian\" has referred to advocates for freedom of the will, or anyone who generally advocated for liberty. The first person to call themselves a \"libertarian\" in the political sense was [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] in 1857. Shortly after, in 1858, he created the New York anarchist journal ''[[Le Libertaire]]''.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} <!--Graham here re motivations --> Anarchist [[S\u00e9bastien Faure]] used the term later in the century to differentiate between anarchists and authoritarian socialists.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} While the term \"libertarian\" has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{efn|name=synonymous}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} For example, \"libertarians\" include both the [[New Left]] Marxists (who do not associate with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party) and extreme liberals (primarily concerned with civil liberties). Additionally, some anarchists use \"libertarian socialist\" to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasize its connections with socialism.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}}\n\n<!-- association with chaos/violence -->Anarchism retains a historical association with chaos and violence.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} In the late 1800s, prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] noted the popular connotations of \"anarchy\" as a synonym for chaos and disorder, and thus a disadvantageous name for a movement. He accepted the term despite this, just as the Dutch [[Sea Beggars]] and [[sans-culottes]] had their own names conferred.{{sfn|Evren|2011|pp=1\u20132}} Anarchists throughout the 20th century have regretted the philosophy's association with chaos, explosives, wanton violence, and marauding.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} These connotations endure contemporaneously through the popular media's association of [[black bloc]] property destruction with the movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}}\n\n<!-- other associations -->The term \"anarchist\" is also used<!-- pejoratively?--> as an [[empty signifier]] reflecting the author's disdain or conscious abrasiveness.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=385}} The term's association with societal malady has been, in part, an intentional strategy by its detractors to discredit it.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385\u2013386}} \"Libertarian\" saw a similar diffusion of purpose within the American libertarian movement as a wider group less studied and less interested in minimal government adopted the term, diluting the potency of its association with the strict rights-based libertarianism of Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard.{{sfn|Doherty|2008|pp=584\u2013585}} Anarcho-capitalists and those who believe in abolition of the state have occupied the fringe of the libertarian movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=414}}\n\n<!-- Left and right? \n-->\n<!-- \"libertarian\" in the 20th century -->The revival of free-market ideologies during the mid-to-late 20th century came with disagreement over what to call the movement. While many of its adherents, especially in the United States, prefer \"libertarian\", many Conservative libertarians reject the term's association with the 1960s [[New Left]] and its connotations of [[libertine]] hedonism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} The movement is divided over the use of \"Conservative\" as an alternative.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}} Those who seek both economic and social liberty would be known as classical \"liberals\", but that term developed associations opposite of the [[limited government]], low-taxation, minimal state advocated by the movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|pp=405\u2013406}} Name variants of the free-market revival movement include [[classical liberalism]], [[economic liberalism]], [[free-market liberalism]] and [[neoliberalism]].{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} \"Libertarian\" has the most colloquial acceptance to describe a member of the movement, or \"economic libertarian\", based on both the ideology's primacy of economics and its distinction from libertarians of the New Left.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}}\n\n== Relation with socialism ==\n\nIn the 19th century, \"anarchism\" and \"socialism\" were used interchangeably, both treated as similar threats to sociopolitical order despite their differences in views towards the state.{{sfn|Kemp|2018|p=180}}<!-- can use more of a segue here... [on relationship with anarchism?] but belongs better in this section than with etymology -->\n\nThe biggest divide in the definition of anarchism is between the main individualist and socialist anarchist traditions.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} While anarchism sits between <!--European intellectual confluence of{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}}-->liberalism and socialism, the definitive extent of its affiliation with either is contested.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}} Historians ([[Rudolf Rocker|Rocker]] and [[George Woodcock|Woodcock]]) have described anarchism as the confluence of liberal individualism and socialist egalitarianism. Other activists and theorists have variously argued that one tradition is \"genuine anarchism\" and the other tradition is oppression ([[Murray Bookchin|Bookchin]] vs. [[anarcho-capitalists]]) or a combination whereof ([[Bob Black|Black]]).{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}<!--could do an aside on Bookchin oversimplification here but I think it's overkill{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}--> These contemporary distinctions trace to the time of early modern anarchism when [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] either broke with groups or otherwise separated the traditions of communist anarchism from individualist, mutualist, and egoist anarchism.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}} Even the very idea of the individualist\u2013socialist divide is contested, as some types of individualist anarchism are largely socialistic.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} Despite these imprecise boundaries and some similarities, socialism and individualism within anarchism have a bifurcated tradition, the former associated with the history of socialism and the latter with [[classical liberalism]] and [[conservatism]] (also known as \"[[right-libertarianism]]\"). Even their shared belief in anti-statism does not provide a common identity, as both traditions differ in their interpretation state-rejection in spite of the common terms.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}\n\n\"Libertarian socialism\" is synonymous<!--(?)--> with classical anarchism in their commitments to autonomy and freedom, decentralization, opposing hierarchy, and opposing the [[vanguardism]] of authoritarian socialism. Generally, this includes classical anarchism, [[council communism]], [[Italian autonomists]], and the Marxism of [[Rosa Luxemburg|Luxemburg]], [[Paul Mattick|Mattick]], and [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], as each practices an anti-authoritarian socialism, despite whether individuals personally identify as fully \"anarchist\" or \"Marxist\".{{sfn|Amster|DeLeon|Fernandez|Nocera|2009|p=3}} Classical anarchism is distinguished from general Marxism by its opposition to centralized or authoritarian organizational structures{{sfn|Amster|DeLeon|Fernandez|Nocera|2009|p=9}} and \"the dominion of man over man\".{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}}<!-- Anti-statist, anti-[[vanguardist]] already share close commonalities but their differences are garden variety when compared against structures of totalitarianism{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|pp=226\u2013227}}--> Socialist-aligned forms of anarchism are also known as \"social anarchism\".{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}\n<!-- modern libertarianism and socialism? \n-->\n\n== Relation with property and capitalism ==\n<!-- alt: Relation with liberalism? -->\nModern American libertarians<!-- note this 1983 source describes modern American libertarians as \"a loosely knit group followers of Ayn Rand\"/Rothbard/Tibor Machan; i.e., anarcho-capitalists, if worth the qualification-->  are distinguished from the dominant libertarian tradition by their relation to property and capital. While both historical libertarianism and contemporary economic libertarianism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through [[free market capitalism|free market capital]]. Historically, libertarians including [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Max Stirner]] supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of government and private ownership.{{sfn|Francis|1983|p=462}} In contrast, <!--while modern American libertarians have condemned governmental encroachment on personal liberties,-->modern American libertarians support freedoms on the basis of their agreement with private property rights.{{sfn|Francis|1983|pp=462\u2013463}}<!--example of Murray Rothbard's arguments that protesters should \"rent\" a street for protest from its owners{{sfn|Francis|1983|pp=462\u2013463}}--> The abolishment of public amenities is a common theme in modern American libertarian writings.{{sfn|Francis|1983|p=463}}\n\n<!-- is an-cap \"anarchist\"? \n-->\n==Types of definition of anarchism==\n\nAnarchism scholar [[Paul McLaughlin(scholar)|Paul McLaughlin]] studies the various definitions of anarchism in his book ''Anarchism and Authority''. According to him, there are 3 common types of anarchism definition:\n*etymological definitions \n*anti-statist definitions\n*anti-authoritarian definitions\n\nBut all fall short from providing a precise definition of anarchism.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Etymological definition===\n\"Anarchy\" derives from the Greek ''anarkhos'', meaning \"without authority\" (as opposed to \"without government/state\").{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} Hence the etymological definition of anarchism as the negation of an authority. But anarchism is generally not simply a negative stance on authority but also a positive stance about how society should be structured.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Anti-statist definition=== \nAnti-statist definitions place the focus of interest on the negation, and confrontation in the real word, of the state by anarchism. But as with the etymological definition, anarchism is much more than anti-statism, as it rejects all various forms of established authority. {{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=27-28}}\n\nThe association between anti-statism and anarchism is both commonly understood and contested.{{efn|name=\u24b6 not just anti-state}}\n\nAnarchism, according to historian [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], exists outside standards of [[political theory]] because its aims are not based on the struggle for power within the state. It is more concerned with moral and economic theory than participation in political systems and indeed often advocates against participation in such systems.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=639}}\n\nAnarchist libertarians and modern economic libertarians share opposition to the state as their only significant commonality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165n26\u2013166}} <!--Modern economic libertarians, as descendants of classical liberalism, are primarily concerned with the limits of the state and freeing individuals, markets, and society from it, while anarchists are primarily concerned with legitimacy, whether governmental or any other authority, as an issue of morality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165\u2013166}}-->\n\n===Anti-authoritarian definitions===\nAnti-authoritarian definitions depicts the rejection of all kind of authorities. Even though these kind of definitions are much broader than the anti-statist ones, there are still handicaps. McLaughlin, who examines under a philosophical scope, claims that anti-authoritarianism is a conclusion of anarchist thought, not an ''a priori'' statement, therefore it can not be used as a definition.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=28}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Definition of fascism]]\n* [[Definition of terrorism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist|40em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"\u24b6 is libsoc\">\n* {{harvnb|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}: \"As such, many people use the term 'anarchism' to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement.\"\n* {{harvnb|Marshall|1992|p=641}}: \"In general, anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ...

Their adherents have a pluralistic and overlapping tradition that makes precise definition of the political ideology difficult or impossible, compounded by a lack of common features, differing priorities of subgroups, lack of academic acceptance, and contentious, historical usage.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\"Anarchism\" generally refers to the anti-authoritarian (libertarian<!--{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=103}}-->) wing of the socialist movement.{{efn|name=\u24b6 is libsoc}} \"Libertarian socialism\" has been a synonym for \"anarchism\" since 1890,{{sfn|Cohn|2009|p=4}} as has the term \"libertarian\" through the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Cohn|2009|p=6}}<!--more: {{efn|name=synonymous}}-->\n\n<!-- explain briefly: why is anarchism/libertarianism hard to define? -->The terms \"anarchism\"<!--{{sfn|Miller|1984|p=2}}?--> and \"libertarianism\" represent broad political ideologies with multiple historical and contemporary meanings.{{sfn|Miller|1984|p=2}}{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=102}}<!-- \"loose terms\" encompassing too much{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|pp=226\u2013227}}--> Incompatibilities within their pluralistic tradition prove difficult or impossible to reconcile into a singular set of core beliefs.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=56}}<!-- source could be better--> The range of ideological disparities within anarchism is often paradoxical and never fully coherent.{{sfn|Miller|1984|pp=2\u20133}} \n\n<!-- other factors in defining anarchism/libertarianism -->Other complicating factors in defining \"anarchism\" include disagreement over its status as a political ideology and contention over the term's historical usage.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385\u2013386}} Anarchism's rejection of the state and state policy largely sits outside the purview of political scientists and in some formulations, its misconstruction as the antithesis of politics contributes to its marginalization as a political ideology.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=385}}\n\n== History of usage ==\n\n<!-- \"libertarian\" usage -->Since the 19th century, \"libertarian\" has referred to advocates for freedom of the will, or anyone who generally advocated for liberty. The first person to call themselves a \"libertarian\" in the political sense was [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] in 1857. Shortly after, in 1858, he created the New York anarchist journal ''[[Le Libertaire]]''.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} <!--Graham here re motivations --> Anarchist [[S\u00e9bastien Faure]] used the term later in the century to differentiate between anarchists and authoritarian socialists.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} While the term \"libertarian\" has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{efn|name=synonymous}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} For example, \"libertarians\" include both the [[New Left]] Marxists (who do not associate with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party) and extreme liberals (primarily concerned with civil liberties). Additionally, some anarchists use \"libertarian socialist\" to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasize its connections with socialism.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}}\n\n<!-- association with chaos/violence -->Anarchism retains a historical association with chaos and violence.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} In the late 1800s, prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] noted the popular connotations of \"anarchy\" as a synonym for chaos and disorder, and thus a disadvantageous name for a movement. He accepted the term despite this, just as the Dutch [[Sea Beggars]] and [[sans-culottes]] had their own names conferred.{{sfn|Evren|2011|pp=1\u20132}} Anarchists throughout the 20th century have regretted the philosophy's association with chaos, explosives, wanton violence, and marauding.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} These connotations endure contemporaneously through the popular media's association of [[black bloc]] property destruction with the movement.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}}\n\n<!-- other associations -->The term \"anarchist\" is also used<!-- pejoratively?--> as an [[empty signifier]] reflecting the author's disdain or conscious abrasiveness.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=385}} The term's association with societal malady has been, in part, an intentional strategy by its detractors to discredit it.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385\u2013386}} \"Libertarian\" saw a similar diffusion of purpose within the American libertarian movement as a wider group less studied and less interested in minimal government adopted the term, diluting the potency of its association with the strict rights-based libertarianism of Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard.{{sfn|Doherty|2008|pp=584\u2013585}} Anarcho-capitalists and those who believe in abolition of the state have occupied the fringe of the libertarian movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=414}}\n\n<!-- Left and right? \n-->\n<!-- \"libertarian\" in the 20th century -->The revival of free-market ideologies during the mid-to-late 20th century came with disagreement over what to call the movement. While many of its adherents, especially in the United States, prefer \"libertarian\", many Conservative libertarians reject the term's association with the 1960s [[New Left]] and its connotations of [[libertine]] hedonism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} The movement is divided over the use of \"Conservative\" as an alternative.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}} Those who seek both economic and social liberty would be known as classical \"liberals\", but that term developed associations opposite of the [[limited government]], low-taxation, minimal state advocated by the movement.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|pp=405\u2013406}} Name variants of the free-market revival movement include [[classical liberalism]], free market liberalism, economic liberalism, and neoliberalism.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=405}} \"Libertarian\" has the most colloquial acceptance to describe a member of the movement, or \"economic libertarian\", based on both the ideology's primacy of economics and its distinction from libertarians of the New Left.{{sfn|Gamble|2013|p=406}}\n\n== Relation with socialism ==\n\nIn the 19th century, \"anarchism\" and \"socialism\" were used interchangeably, both treated as similar threats to sociopolitical order despite their differences in views towards the state.{{sfn|Kemp|2018|p=180}}<!-- can use more of a segue here... [on relationship with anarchism?] but belongs better in this section than with etymology -->\n\nThe biggest divide in the definition of anarchism is between the main individualist and socialist anarchist traditions.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} While anarchism sits between <!--European intellectual confluence of{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}}-->liberalism and socialism, the definitive extent of its affiliation with either is contested.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}} Historians ([[Rudolf Rocker|Rocker]] and [[George Woodcock|Woodcock]]) have described anarchism as the confluence of liberal individualism and socialist egalitarianism. Other activists and theorists have variously argued that one tradition is \"genuine anarchism\" and the other tradition is oppression ([[Murray Bookchin|Bookchin]] vs. [[anarcho-capitalists]]) or a combination whereof ([[Bob Black|Black]]).{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}<!--could do an aside on Bookchin oversimplification here but I think it's overkill{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}--> These contemporary distinctions trace to the time of early modern anarchism when [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] either broke with groups or otherwise separated the traditions of communist anarchism from individualist, mutualist, and egoist anarchism.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}} Even the very idea of the individualist\u2013socialist divide is contested, as some types of individualist anarchism are largely socialistic.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}} Despite these imprecise boundaries and some similarities, socialism and individualism within anarchism have a bifurcated tradition, the former associated with the history of socialism and the latter with [[classical liberalism]] and [[conservatism]] (also known as \"[[right-libertarianism]]\"). Even their shared belief in anti-statism does not provide a common identity, as both traditions differ in their interpretation state-rejection in spite of the common terms.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=388}}\n\n\"Libertarian socialism\" is synonymous<!--(?)--> with classical anarchism in their commitments to autonomy and freedom, decentralization, opposing hierarchy, and opposing the [[vanguardism]] of authoritarian socialism. Generally, this includes classical anarchism, [[council communism]], [[Italian autonomists]], and the Marxism of [[Rosa Luxemburg|Luxemburg]], [[Paul Mattick|Mattick]], and [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], as each practices an anti-authoritarian socialism, despite whether individuals personally identify as fully \"anarchist\" or \"Marxist\".{{sfn|Amster|DeLeon|Fernandez|Nocera|2009|p=3}} Classical anarchism is distinguished from general Marxism by its opposition to centralized or authoritarian organizational structures{{sfn|Amster|DeLeon|Fernandez|Nocera|2009|p=9}} and \"the dominion of man over man\".{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}}<!-- Anti-statist, anti-[[vanguardist]] already share close commonalities but their differences are garden variety when compared against structures of totalitarianism{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|pp=226\u2013227}}--> Socialist-aligned forms of anarchism are also known as \"social anarchism\".{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}\n<!-- modern libertarianism and socialism? \n-->\n\n== Relation with property and capitalism ==\n<!-- alt: Relation with liberalism? -->\nModern American libertarians<!-- note this 1983 source describes modern American libertarians as \"a loosely knit group followers of Ayn Rand\"/Rothbard/Tibor Machan; i.e., anarcho-capitalists, if worth the qualification-->  are distinguished from the dominant libertarian tradition by their relation to property and capital. While both historical libertarianism and contemporary economic libertarianism share general antipathy towards power by government authority, the latter exempts power wielded through [[free market capitalism|free market capital]]. Historically, libertarians including [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Max Stirner]] supported the protection of an individual's freedom from powers of government and private ownership.{{sfn|Francis|1983|p=462}} In contrast, <!--while modern American libertarians have condemned governmental encroachment on personal liberties,-->modern American libertarians support freedoms on the basis of their agreement with private property rights.{{sfn|Francis|1983|pp=462\u2013463}}<!--example of Murray Rothbard's arguments that protesters should \"rent\" a street for protest from its owners{{sfn|Francis|1983|pp=462\u2013463}}--> The abolishment of public amenities is a common theme in modern American libertarian writings.{{sfn|Francis|1983|p=463}}\n\n<!-- is an-cap \"anarchist\"? \n-->\n==Types of definition of anarchism==\n\nAnarchism scholar [[Paul McLaughlin(scholar)|Paul McLaughlin]] studies the various definitions of anarchism in his book ''Anarchism and Authority''. According to him, there are 3 common types of anarchism definition:\n*etymological definitions \n*anti-statist definitions\n*anti-authoritarian definitions\n\nBut all fall short from providing a precise definition of anarchism.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Etymological definition===\n\"Anarchy\" derives from the Greek ''anarkhos'', meaning \"without authority\" (as opposed to \"without government/state\").{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} Hence the etymological definition of anarchism as the negation of an authority. But anarchism is generally not simply a negative stance on authority but also a positive stance about how society should be structured.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=27}}\n\n===Anti-statist definition=== \nAnti-statist definitions place the focus of interest on the negation, and confrontation in the real word, of the state by anarchism. But as with the etymological definition, anarchism is much more than anti-statism, as it rejects all various forms of established authority. {{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=27-28}}\n\nThe association between anti-statism and anarchism is both commonly understood and contested.{{efn|name=\u24b6 not just anti-state}}\n\nAnarchism, according to historian [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], exists outside standards of [[political theory]] because its aims are not based on the struggle for power within the state. It is more concerned with moral and economic theory than participation in political systems and indeed often advocates against participation in such systems.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=639}}\n\nAnarchist libertarians and modern economic libertarians share opposition to the state as their only significant commonality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165n26\u2013166}} <!--Modern economic libertarians, as descendants of classical liberalism, are primarily concerned with the limits of the state and freeing individuals, markets, and society from it, while anarchists are primarily concerned with legitimacy, whether governmental or any other authority, as an issue of morality.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=165\u2013166}}-->\n\n===Anti-authoritarian definitions===\nAnti-authoritarian definitions depicts the rejection of all kind of authorities. Even though these kind of definitions are much broader than the anti-statist ones, there are still handicaps. McLaughlin, who examines under a philosophical scope, claims that anti-authoritarianism is a conclusion of anarchist thought, not an ''a priori'' statement, therefore it can not be used as a definition.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=28}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Definition of fascism]]\n* [[Definition of terrorism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist|40em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"\u24b6 is libsoc\">\n* {{harvnb|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}: \"As such, many people use the term 'anarchism' to describe the anti-authoritarian wing of the socialist movement.\"\n* {{harvnb|Marshall|1992|p=641}}: \"In general, anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ...
