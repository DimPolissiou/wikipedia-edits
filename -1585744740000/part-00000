The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed as a result of an avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater.

[[Seismic]] studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is greater than 1400 metres (4593.2&nbsp;feet) thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nakamura |first1=Yosio |title=Timing problem with the Lunar Module impact data as recorded by the LPSE and corrected near-surface structure at the Apollo 17 site |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2011 |volume=116 |issue=E12 |doi=10.1029/2011JE003972 }}</ref> Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low [[albedo]], or reflectivity, is a direct result of the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of [[plagioclase]], but also contain amounts of [[clinopyroxene]] and other [[minerals]].<ref name=Wolfe/>\n\nThe unconsolidated regolith layer on the valley floor has a thickness of about {{convert|14|m|ft}} and contains ejecta from many impacts, most notably Tycho. This enabled samples to be retrieved from this impact without having to visit the crater itself. The possibility that some craters in the valley could be secondary impacts of Tycho created further opportunities for sampling ejecta from that impact.<ref name=Wolfe/>\n\nThere are several geologic deposits on the valley floor originating from several different events in the geologic timeline of the Moon. One of these formations, the light mantle, is a deposit of lightly colored material in a series of projections extending about six&nbsp;kilometres (3.7&nbsp;mi) from the south massif across the floor. Pre-mission analyses suggested that this deposit might be the result of an avalanche originating from the northern slope of the south massif. Post-mission analysis of samples of the material show that it is primarily composed of fine-grained material and scattered rock fragments that were presumably spread across the valley floor from the south massif at some point. Evidence from samples and visual observations taken during Apollo 17 show that the light mantle varies in thickness throughout the valley. Craters located farther away from the south massif penetrate through the light mantle to darker underlying material. Meanwhile, craters close to the south massif as wide as {{convert|75|m|ft}} do not appear to penetrate to darker material at all. The age of this formation is estimated to be about the same as the central crater cluster, or about 70\u201395 million years old.<ref name=Wolfe/>\n\n[[Troctolite 76535]], a [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] [[troctolite]] composed primarily of [[olivine]] and [[plagioclase]] was recovered in the valley as part of a rake sample.

Landing sites considered and rejected for previous missions were reconsidered. Taurus\u2013Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] crater, [[Tsiolkovskiy (crater)|Tsiolkovskiy]] crater on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]], among others. All but Taurus\u2013Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.<ref name=lpi/>\n\nTaurus\u2013Littrow was eventually selected with the objectives of sampling ancient highland material and young volcanic material in the same landing site. The Taurus\u2013Littrow site offered both of these in the form of highland material in the Tycho ejecta sampled and the prospect that some of the craters in the area could be volcanic vents.<ref name=lpi/>\n\n{{Panorama |image=File:Apollo 17 Moon Panorama.jpg|height=100|alt=|caption=<center>Panorama of the Taurus\u2013Littrow valley taken on the Apollo 17 mission.</center>}}\n\n==Craters within Taurus\u2013Littrow==\n{{columns\n|width=200px\n|col1 =\n*[[Bowen-Apollo (crater)|Bowen]]\n*[[Bront\u00eb (lunar crater)|Bront\u00eb]]\n*[[Camelot (crater)|Camelot]]\n*[[Cochise (crater)|Cochise]]\n*[[Emory (crater)|Emory]]\n*[[Henry (Apollo lunar crater)|Henry]]\n*[[Hess-Apollo (crater)|Hess]]\n|col2 =\n*[[Horatio (crater)|Horatio]]\n*[[Lara (lunar crater)|Lara]]\n*[[Mackin (crater)|Mackin]]\n*[[Nansen-Apollo (crater)|Nansen]]\n*[[Powell (crater)|Powell]]\n*[[Shakespeare (lunar crater)|Shakespeare]]\n*[[Sherlock (crater)|Sherlock]]\n|col3 =\n*[[Shorty (crater)|Shorty]]\n*[[Steno-Apollo (crater)|Steno]]\n*[[Trident (crater)|Trident]]\n*[[Van Serg (crater)|Van Serg]]\n*[[Victory (crater)|Victory]]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n*[[Apollo 17]]\n*[[Geology of the Moon]]\n*[[Mare Serenitatis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Taurus-Littrow}}\n*[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/as17psr.pdf Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report]\n*[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17profpaper.htm Geological Survey Professional Paper 1080] \u2014 Apollo 17 Professional Paper\n*[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/images/Lunar/lac_43_lo.pdf LAC 43] \u2014 Lambert Conformal Projection map\n*[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/search/feature/?feature=Apollo+17&sort= Apollo Image Atlas] \u2014 Images of Taurus\u2013Littrow\n*[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/LPST/43d1s2/ 43D1S2(25) Apollo 17 Traverses] \u2014 Apollo 17 traverse map\n*[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17sampcat.html Apollo 17 Sample Catalog] \u2014 Catalog of samples from Taurus\u2013Littrow\n\n{{Apollo landing sites}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taurus-Littrow (lunar valley)}}\n[[Category:Valleys on the Moon]]\n[[Category:Apollo program]]\n[[Category:Apollo 17]]\n", "text_old": "{{Good Article}}\n{{Coord|20.0|31.0|display=title|globe:Moon}}\n[[File:Taurus-littrow-valley.jpg|thumb|right|Labeled aerial photo of the Taurus\u2013Littrow valley (north is at the bottom).]]\n\n'''Taurus\u2013Littrow''' is a [[Moon|lunar]] [[valley]] located on the [[Near side of the Moon|near side]] at the coordinates {{Lunar coords and quad cat|20.0|N|31.0|E|globe:Moon}}.

Pre-mission analyses suggested that this deposit might be the result of an avalanche originating from the northern slope of the south massif. Post-mission analysis of samples of the material show that it is primarily composed of fine-grained material and scattered rock fragments that were presumably spread across the valley floor from the south massif at some point. Evidence from samples and visual observations taken during Apollo 17 show that the light mantle varies in thickness throughout the valley. Craters located farther away from the south massif penetrate through the light mantle to darker underlying material. Meanwhile, craters close to the south massif as wide as {{convert|75|m|ft}} do not appear to penetrate to darker material at all. The age of this formation is estimated to be about the same as the central crater cluster, or about 70\u201395 million years old.<ref name=Wolfe/>\n\n[[Troctolite 76535]], a [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] [[troctolite]] composed primarily of [[olivine]] and [[plagioclase]] was recovered in the valley as part of a rake sample.

Landing sites considered and rejected for previous missions were reconsidered. Taurus\u2013Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] crater, [[Tsiolkovskiy (crater)|Tsiolkovskiy]] crater on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]], among others. All but Taurus\u2013Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.<ref name=lpi/>\n\nTaurus\u2013Littrow was eventually selected with the objectives of sampling ancient highland material and young volcanic material in the same landing site. The Taurus\u2013Littrow site offered both of these in the form of highland material in the Tycho ejecta sampled and the prospect that some of the craters in the area could be volcanic vents.<ref name=lpi/>\n<br />\n{{Panorama |image=File:Apollo 17 Moon Panorama.jpg|height=100|alt=|caption=<center>Panorama of the Taurus\u2013Littrow valley taken on the Apollo 17 mission.</center>}}\n\n==Craters within Taurus\u2013Littrow==\n{{columns\n|width=200px\n|col1 =\n*[[Bowen-Apollo (crater)|Bowen]]\n*[[Bront\u00eb (lunar crater)|Bront\u00eb]]\n*[[Camelot (crater)|Camelot]]\n*[[Cochise (crater)|Cochise]]\n*[[Emory (crater)|Emory]]\n*[[Henry (Apollo lunar crater)|Henry]]\n*[[Hess-Apollo (crater)|Hess]]\n|col2 =\n*[[Horatio (crater)|Horatio]]\n*[[Lara (lunar crater)|Lara]]\n*[[Mackin (crater)|Mackin]]\n*[[Nansen-Apollo (crater)|Nansen]]\n*[[Powell (crater)|Powell]]\n*[[Shakespeare (lunar crater)|Shakespeare]]\n*[[Sherlock (crater)|Sherlock]]\n|col3 =\n*[[Shorty (crater)|Shorty]]\n*[[Steno-Apollo (crater)|Steno]]\n*[[Trident (crater)|Trident]]\n*[[Van Serg (crater)|Van Serg]]\n*[[Victory (crater)|Victory]]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n*[[Apollo 17]]\n*[[Geology of the Moon]]\n*[[Mare Serenitatis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Taurus-Littrow}}\n*[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/as17psr.pdf Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report]\n*[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17profpaper.htm Geological Survey Professional Paper 1080] &mdash; Apollo 17 Professional Paper\n*[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/images/Lunar/lac_43_lo.pdf LAC 43] &mdash; Lambert Conformal Projection map\n*[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/search/feature/?feature=Apollo+17&sort= Apollo Image Atlas] &mdash; Images of Taurus\u2013Littrow\n*[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/LPST/43d1s2/ 43D1S2(25) Apollo 17 Traverses] &mdash; Apollo 17 traverse map\n*[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17sampcat.html Apollo 17 Sample Catalog] &mdash; Catalog of samples from Taurus\u2013Littrow\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{Apollo landing sites}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taurus-Littrow (lunar valley)}}\n[[Category:Valleys on the Moon]]\n[[Category:Apollo program]]\n[[Category:Apollo 17]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor nitpicking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus%E2%80%93Littrow"}

The channel then launched at 7&nbsp;pm with a promotional advert before fading into \"[[Davina McCall|Davina (McCall)]] and [[Steve Jones (Welsh presenter)|Steve (Jones)]]'s 20 Big Ones\"; the first song at number 20 being \"[[The Pretender (Foo Fighters song)|The Pretender]]\" by [[Foo Fighters]], and [[Kylie Minogue]]'s \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" at number 1.\n\nKylie Minogue's [[KYLIEX2008]] tour was broadcast, and completing the launch night line-up was ''[[Big Brother Live]]'', where [[Rachel Rice]] was given a 'favourite things party' for surviving that night's eviction. She and her chosen favourite housemate, [[Kathreya Kasisopa]], were taken to a private room where Rachel's top 10 favourite songs were played. Live coverage of the 2008 [[V Festival]] was shown on 16 and 17 August and highlights were shown on subsequent days. These highlights sparked complaints, however, as to the overall quality of coverage, due to the main headliners not getting their full sets played out.\n\nDespite the arguments between Davina and Steve as to whose face appeared first on the channel, the first face seen on 4Music was Kylie Minogue, introducing her live concert at 9&nbsp;pm on the launch night (as they later explained).\n\nThe launch also saw a new [[Digital on-screen graphic]] appear on the screen, and new [[idents]] with a woman swivelling on a chair with the channel's logo in the background.

This teaching is summarized in his oft-used explanation, \"The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.\u201d This understanding of the gospel is contrasted to what Keller calls \u201ctraditional religion\u201d (which he defines as a set of rules, rituals or actions that enable an individual to earn salvation or favor with God) as well as \u201cirreligion\u201d (which he defines as the belief that there is no God or no need for his favor). This has been referred to as a \u201cgospel third way,\u201d or \u201cgospel-centered\u201d approach. Typical of this teaching is his interpretation of the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] (see ''The Prodigal God''), based on a teaching of one of Keller's mentors, [[Edmund Clowney]].\n\n===Apologetics===\nKeller's preaching and writing in his [[apologetics]] is characterized by a respectful orientation towards an educated and skeptical audience outside the faith. His most explicit work on the subject is ''The Reason for God''<ref name=\"Best sellers: nonfiction\"/> which he attributes to thousands of conversations with skeptical New Yorkers over the course of his ministry (''Reason'', xix). Elsewhere he has written about the loss of a [[Christian culture]] in the West, including in the academic and cultural establishments, and the need for Christians to contextualize to the current secular and anti-religious cultural climate.\n\nOn [[creationism]], Keller states his view is not strictly [[Biblical literalism|literal]] and that [[evolution]] is \"neither ruled in nor ruled out\" in his church.<ref name=\"words\">{{cite news|title = In His Words: The Pastor on the Issues | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1998}}</ref> Keller has written on the topic for the [[Biologos Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/uploads/projects/Keller_white_paper.pdf |format=PDF |title=Creation, Evolution, and Christian Laypeople : What's The Problem |author=Tim Keller |website=Biologos.org |accessdate=2016-08-28}}</ref>\n\nKeller's major influences in apologetics include [[C.S.

Keller states that contemporary idol worship continues today in the form of an addiction or devotion to money, career, sex, power and anything people seek to give significance and satisfaction in life other than God (detailed in his book ''Counterfeit Gods'').<ref name=nytimes122812>{{cite news|last=GIRIDHARADAS|first=Anand|title=Keeping One's Work in Perspective|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/us/29iht-currents29.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name=morningjoe>{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joe|title=Morning Joe: Religious Leaders share their spiritual messages|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540/vp/41662944#41662944|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=Morning Joe|date=February 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Social justice and politics===\nKeller disavows the \"[[Social Gospel]]\" that has characterized [[Mainline Protestant]] churches, which advocates liberal political causes and de-emphasizes the doctrines of sin and substitutionary sacrifice. However he has also criticized the evangelical alliance with Republicans and argued that Christianity is a much broader global movement that agrees with some liberal and some conservative issues (and critiques them both).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Keller |first1=Timothy |title=How Do Christians Fit Into the Two-Party System?

This teaching is summarized in his oft-used explanation, \"The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.\u201d This understanding of the gospel is contrasted to what Keller calls \u201ctraditional religion\u201d (which he defines as a set of rules, rituals or actions that enable an individual to earn salvation or favor with God) as well as \u201cirreligion\u201d (which he defines as the belief that there is no God or no need for his favor). This has been referred to as a \u201cgospel third way,\u201d or \u201cgospel-centered\u201d approach. Typical of this teaching is his interpretation of the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] (see ''The Prodigal God''), based on a teaching of one of Keller's mentors, [[Edmund Clowney]].\n\n===Apologetics===\nKeller's preaching and writing in his [[apologetics]] is characterized by a respectful orientation towards an educated and skeptical audience outside the faith. His most explicit work on the subject is ''The Reason for God''<ref name=\"Best sellers: nonfiction\"/> which he attributes to thousands of conversations with skeptical New Yorkers over the course of his ministry (''Reason'', xix). Elsewhere he has written about the loss of a [[Christian culture]] in the West, including in the academic and cultural establishments, and the need for Christians to contextualize to the current secular and anti-religious cultural climate.\n\nOn [[creationism]], Keller states his view is not strictly [[Biblical literalism|literal]] and that [[evolution]] is \"neither ruled in nor ruled out\" in his church.<ref name=\"words\">{{cite news|title = In His Words: The Pastor on the Issues | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1998}}</ref> Keller has written on the topic for the [[Biologos Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/uploads/projects/Keller_white_paper.pdf |format=PDF |title=Creation, Evolution, and Christian Laypeople : What's The Problem |author=Tim Keller |website=Biologos.org |accessdate=2016-08-28}}</ref>\n\nKeller's major influences in apologetics include [[C.S.

Keller states that contemporary idol worship continues today in the form of an addiction or devotion to money, career, sex, power and anything people seek to give significance and satisfaction in life other than God (detailed in his book ''Counterfeit Gods'').<ref name=nytimes122812>{{cite news|last=GIRIDHARADAS|first=Anand|title=Keeping One's Work in Perspective|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/us/29iht-currents29.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 28, 2012}}</ref><ref name=morningjoe>{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joe|title=Morning Joe: Religious Leaders share their spiritual messages|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540/vp/41662944#41662944|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=Morning Joe|date=February 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Social justice and politics===\nKeller disavows the \"[[Social Gospel]]\" that has characterized [[Mainline Protestant]] churches, which advocates liberal political causes and de-emphasizes the doctrines of sin and substitutionary sacrifice. However he has also criticized the evangelical alliance with Republicans and argued that Christianity is a much broader global movement that agrees with some liberal and some conservative issues (and critiques them both).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Keller |first1=Timothy |title=How Do Christians Fit Into the Two-Party System?

Hanging or standing in front of the [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] in every Jewish [[synagogue]], it is meant to represent the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as well as the continuously burning fire on the [[altar]] of burnt offerings in front of the Temple.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|6:5|KJV}}</ref> It also symbolizes God's eternal presence and is therefore never extinguished.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} It is also intended to draw parallels between God and fire, or light, which is emphasized throughout the book of Exodus in the [[Torah]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThese lights are never allowed to dim or go out, and in the case of electric problems, alternative emergency energy sources are used to prevent it from diminishing. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThough once fuelled by oil, most today are electric lights.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Hanukkah story===\n{{Main article|Hanukkah}} ohhh naaace\n\nThe eternal light is central to one of many stories behind the celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. When the ancient [[Maccabees]] rebelled and reclaimed the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], they rekindled the eternal light.
