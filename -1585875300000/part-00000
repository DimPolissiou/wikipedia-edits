The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to TfNSW underestimating the cost of the project.<ref name=\"dec design adjustment\">{{cite web |url = http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/cbd-and-south-east-light-rail-improvements-deliver-better-service-customers |title = CBD and South East Light Rail improvements to deliver a better service for customers |date=2 December 2014 |publisher=Transport for NSW |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214174608/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/cbd-and-south-east-light-rail-improvements-deliver-better-service-customers |archive-date=14 December 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-light-rail-line-costs-blow-out-to-22-billion--600-million-more-than-budgeted-20141109-11jazn.html Sydney light rail line costs blow out to $2.2 billion \u2013 $600 million more than budgeted] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 10 November 2014/</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Costs are higher and benefits are lower than the approved business case |url = http://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/publications/latest-reports/performance/cbd-and-south-east-light-rail-project/executive-summary/1-executive-summary |publisher = Audit Office of New South Wales |accessdate = 1 December 2016 |date = 30 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\nA [[pedestrian zone]] was established along approximately 40% of George Street, between [[Bathurst Street, Sydney|Bathurst]] and [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter]] Streets.<ref name=\"TransportNSW13Dec12\" /><ref name=\"SSIA Supporting Document\">{{cite web |url = http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/projects/CSELR_State_Infrastructure_Application_June_2013.pdf |title = CBD and South East Light Rail \u2013 State Significant Infrastructure Application Supporting Document |publisher=[[Transport for NSW]] |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate = 12 July 2013 |page = 23 |url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927100041/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/projects/CSELR_State_Infrastructure_Application_June_2013.pdf |archivedate = 27 September 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=modificationreport>{{cite web|title=CBD and South East Light Rail \u2013 Modifications Report|url=https://majorprojects.affinitylive.com/public/bd9fa8e85aeb4396512d5e710e3d8da5/20141202_01_CBD_and_South_East_light_rail_modifications_report.pdf|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=3 December 2014|pages=10\u201311, 17\u201321, 25, 46\u201349, 52}}</ref>\n\nThe section between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay is wire-free, with trams using [[Alstom]]'s proprietary [[ground-level power supply]] technology to run instead.<ref>{{cite news |last=Campion|first=Vikki |title=Sydney's new light rail system will feature futuristic wire-free trams to ensure clutter-free streets |url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sydney8217s-new-light-rail-system-will-feature-futuristic-wirefree-trams-to-ensure-clutterfree-streets/story-fni0cx12-1226714773633 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph }}</ref> This was originally to have been achieved by equipping the trams with batteries and providing recharging facilities at stops.\n\nThe line is designed to handle special events in the [[Moore Park, New South Wales#Sports and recreation|Moore Park precinct]] and at [[Randwick Racecourse]].

The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey.\n\nTo accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]], [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh]], [[Park Street, Sydney|Park]], Druitt, Clarence and [[York Street, Sydney|York]] Streets.<ref name=\"TfNSW28May15\" /> Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as [[Railway Square]], [[Queen Victoria Building]] and [[King Street Wharf]].

Some bus routes which were diverted from George Street to other streets during the construction, were proposed to terminate at Railway Square with their passengers to join the Light Rail while others will be rerouted permanently to the streets to which they were diverted.<ref name=\"EISVol2128132\">{{cite web|url=http://data.sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/s3fs-public/CSELR_EIS_Volume_2.pdf|title=CSELR-Environmental-Impact-Statement Volume 2: Technical Papers 1 & 2|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=14 November 2013|accessdate=2 May 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401092645/http://data.sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/s3fs-public/CSELR_EIS_Volume_2.pdf|archivedate=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Twenty bus routes were proposed to be withdrawn or curtailed between Kingsford/Randwick and Railway Square/Circular Quay. A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the [[University of New South Wales]] to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus.\n\nThe proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:<ref name=\"EISVol2128132\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!colspan=\"4\"| Proposed Eastern Suburbs bus route changes\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\"| Route buses\n|-\n!

There he receives a telegram prompting him to return to [[London]]. He instructs the concierge to book him a first-class compartment on the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]]-route [[Orient Express]] service leaving that night. Although the train is fully booked, Poirot obtains a second-class berth through with the intervention of a friend and fellow Belgian who is also boarding the train, Monsieur Bouc, a director of the railway, [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]].\n\nA brash and [[vulgarity|vulgar]] American businessman named Ratchett is aboard the train with his personal secretary and translator, Hector McQueen. Once Poirot is recognized as the famous detective, Ratchett approaches him and asks if he will act as his protector as Ratchett has been receiving death threats. Poirot, repulsed by Mr. Ratchett, refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first-class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, he is awakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next door. The conductor knocks on Ratchett's door, but a voice from inside responds, \"Ce n'est rien. Je me suis tromp\u00e9\" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor there is a man in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water, and the conductor informs him that the train is stuck in a snowbank before he hears a loud thump next door.\n\nThe next morning, the train is still stopped and M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. He first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. He discovers the following: the body has 12 stab wounds, the window had been left open, presumably to trick the investigators into thinking the murderer escaped, even though there are no footprints in the snow, a handkerchief with the initial 'H', a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used, and a charred piece of paper with the name 'Armstrong' on it.\n\nThe piece of paper helps Poirot work out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years earlier, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year-old, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child within two hours of kidnapping her. Poirot concludes that 'Ratchett' was actually Cassetti. The voice in Ratchett's compartment could not have been the American's, since Ratchett/Cassetti does not speak French.\n\nPoirot begins the interviews, starting with the conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note. Hector is surprised that Poirot found it because he thought it had been destroyed. Poirot then interviews Masterman and Mrs. Hubbard, who claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: several passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway on the night of the murder, but no one admits to owning a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between her compartment and Ratchett's. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagons-Lits uniform blazer.\n\nPoirot checks all of the passengers' luggage, during which he is surprised by several things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagons-Lits uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag, and the red kimono is found in his own luggage.\n\nFollowing the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine, and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case, going into a trance-like state. When he surfaces from it, he deduces the solution. He calls in several people and reveals their true identities. All of them were connected with the Armstrong tragedy in some way. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She smudged her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess; Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrongs' chauffeur; Masterman was Col. Armstrong's valet; and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff, revealed to be Sonia Armstrong's godmother, claims the monogrammed handkerchief found in Ratchett's compartment.\n\nPoirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The first solution is that a stranger entered the train when it stopped at Vinkovci, killed Ratchett, and disembarked from the train. The second solution is that all the passengers aboard the Orient Express participated in stabbing Cassetti/Ratchett to death. Poirot suggests that 12 of the 13 passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as the famous actress Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct.\n\nPoirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion.\n\n==Characters==\n*Hercule Poirot - a retired Belgian police officer and private detective. \n*Monsieur Bouc - the director of the Compagnie Wagon Lits and formerly an employee of the Belgian police force where he was a colleague of Poirot.\n*Dr Constantine - a physician who acts as the coroner aboard the Orient Express.\n*Mary Debenham - Daisy Armstrong's former governess.\n*Mrs Hubbard - really Linda Arden, famous actress and grandmother of Daisy Armstrong.\n*Colonel Arbuthnot - a friend of Colonel Armstrong, in love with Mary Debenham.\n*Princess Dragomiroff - a [[white \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian]] [[Russian nobility|princess]], ultimately revealed to be the godmother of Sonia Armstrong. \n*Hector McQueen - Ratchett's personal secretary and translator. \n*Ratchett  - [[Pseudonym|AKA]] Cassetti, kidnapper and murderer of three-year-old Daisy Armstrong. \n*Countess Andrenyi - the sister of Sonia Armstrong, notable because she does not take part in the stabbing murder.\n*Count Andrenyi - the Count takes his wife's place in the stabbing murder.\n*Cyrus Hardman - an American who was in love with Daisy's French nurse who committed suicide after Daisy was killed. \n*Antonio Foscarelli - the Armstrongs' former chauffeur who had loved little Daisy.\n*Greta Ohlsson - Daisy Armstrong's former nurse.\n*Hildegarde Schmidt -  Princess Dragomiroff's maid, formerly the Armstrongs' cook.\n*Edward Henry Masterman - Ratchett's valet, a remote and haughty man, Armstrong's batman in the war and valet in New York.\n*Pierre Michel - father of the suicidal nursemaid of Daisy Armstrong.\n\n==Reception==\nThe ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of 11 January 1934 outlined the plot and concluded that \"The little grey cells solve once more the seemingly insoluble. Mrs Christie makes an improbable tale very real, and keeps her readers enthralled and guessing to the end.\"<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times Literary Supplement]]|title=Murder on the Orient Express (review)|date=11 January 1934|publisher=[[News UK]]|location=London, England|page=29}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' of 4 March 1934, Isaac Anderson wrote, \"The great Belgian detective's guesses are more than shrewd; they are positively miraculous. Although both the murder plot and the solution verge upon the impossible, Agatha Christie has contrived to make them appear quite convincing for the time being, and what more than that can a mystery addict desire?\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Isaac|last=Anderson|title=Murder on the Orient Express (review)|newspaper=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=4 March 1934|page=11}}</ref>\n\nThe reviewer in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of 12 January 1934 noted that the murder would have been \"perfect\" (i.e. a [[perfect crime]]) had Poirot not been on the train and also overheard a conversation between Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot before he boarded; however, \"The 'little grey cells' worked admirably, and the solution surprised their owner as much as it may well surprise the reader, for the secret is well kept and the manner of the telling is in Mrs Christie's usual admirable manner.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Murder on the Orient Express (review)|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=12 January 1934|page=5}}</ref>\n\nRobert Barnard said that this novel was \"The best of the railway stories. The Orient Express, snowed up in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], provides the ideal 'closed' set-up for a classic-style exercise in detection, as well as an excuse for an international cast-list. Contains my favourite line in all Christie: 'Poor creature, she's a Swede.' Impeccably clued, with a clever use of the [[Cyrillic script]] (cf.

The novel used many elements of the real life case: a young child, firstborn of the family, was kidnapped for ransom directly from the crib, the parents were famous, the father was a well known pilot and the mother pregnant, and the ransom was paid but the child found dead soon after. An innocent, but perhaps loose-lipped, maid employed by Lindbergh's parents was suspected of involvement in the crime. After being harshly interrogated by police, she committed suicide.<ref name=\"autogenerated105\">{{cite book|first1=Dennis|last1=Sanders|first2=Len|last2=Lovallo|title=The Agatha Christie Companion|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|location=New York City |pages= 105\u201308 |date=1984 |isbn=978-0425118450}}</ref>\n\nTwo less notable events helped inspire her novel: Agatha Christie's first journey on the Orient Express in late 1928, and a blizzard near [[\u00c7erkezk\u00f6y|Cherkeskoy]], [[Turkey]], that [[Marooning|marooned]] an Orient Express for six days just a few months later, in February 1929.<ref name=\"autogenerated105\"/>\n\nFlooding from rainfall that washed sections of track away in December 1931 halted Christie's return from her husband's archaeological dig at [[Nineveh]] aboard an Orient Express for 24 hours.

The character Cyrus Hardman (the former American police officer turned private detective) has been largely amalgamated with the chauffeur Foscarelli (in as much as regards being the lover of the dead maid) and Dr Constantine (who in the novel is unrelated to the murders) becomes a co-conspirator.

He instructs the concierge to book him a first-class compartment on the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]]-route [[Orient Express]] service leaving that night. Although the train is fully booked, Poirot obtains a second-class berth through with the intervention of a friend and fellow Belgian who is also boarding the train, Monsieur Bouc, a director of the railway, [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]].\n\nA brash and [[vulgarity|vulgar]] American businessman named Ratchett is aboard the train with his personal secretary and translator, Hector McQueen. Once Poirot is recognized as the famous detective, Ratchett approaches him and asks if he will act as his protector as Ratchett has been receiving death threats. Poirot, repulsed by Mr. Ratchett, refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first-class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, he is awakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next door. The conductor knocks on Ratchett's door, but a voice from inside responds, \"Ce n'est rien. Je me suis tromp\u00e9\" (It is nothing. I am mistaken).

Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard. Poirot tells M. Bouc he will investigate the case. He first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. He discovers the following: the body has 12 stab wounds, the window had been left open, presumably to trick the investigators into thinking the murderer escaped, even though there are no footprints in the snow, a handkerchief with the initial 'H', a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used, and a charred piece of paper with the name 'Armstrong' on it.\n\nThe piece of paper helps Poirot work out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years earlier, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year-old, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child within two hours of kidnapping her. Poirot concludes that 'Ratchett' was actually Cassetti. The voice in Ratchett's compartment could not have been the American's, since Ratchett/Cassetti does not speak French.\n\nPoirot begins the interviews, starting with the conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note. Hector is surprised that Poirot found it because he thought it had been destroyed. Poirot then interviews Masterman and Mrs. Hubbard, who claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: several passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway on the night of the murder, but no one admits to owning a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between her compartment and Ratchett's. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagons-Lits uniform blazer.\n\nPoirot checks all of the passengers' luggage, during which he is surprised by several things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagons-Lits uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag, and the red kimono is found in his own luggage.\n\nFollowing the luggage check, Poirot, Dr. Constantine, and M. Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case, going into a trance-like state. When he surfaces from it, he deduces the solution. He calls in several people and reveals their true identities. All of them were connected with the Armstrong tragedy in some way. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She smudged her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess; Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrongs' chauffeur; Masterman was Col. Armstrong's valet; and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff, revealed to be Sonia Armstrong's godmother, claims the monogrammed handkerchief found in Ratchett's compartment.\n\nPoirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The first solution is that a stranger entered the train when it stopped at Vinkovci, killed Ratchett, and disembarked from the train. The second solution is that all the passengers aboard the Orient Express participated in stabbing Cassetti/Ratchett to death. Poirot suggests that 12 of the 13 passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs. Hubbard, revealed as the famous actress Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct.\n\nPoirot suggests that M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion.\n\n==Characters==\n*Hercule Poirot - a retired Belgian police officer and private detective. \n*Monsieur Bouc - the director of the Compagnie Wagon Lits and formerly an employee of the Belgian police force where he was a colleague of Poirot.\n*Dr Constantine - a physician who acts as the coroner aboard the Orient Express.\n*Mary Debenham - Daisy Armstrong's former governess.\n*Mrs Hubbard - really Linda Arden, famous actress and grandmother of Daisy Armstrong.\n*Colonel Arbuthnot - a friend of Colonel Armstrong, in love with Mary Debenham.\n*Princess Dragomiroff - a [[white \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian]] [[Russian nobility|princess]], ultimately revealed to be the godmother of Sonia Armstrong. \n*Hector McQueen - Ratchett's personal secretary and translator. \n*Ratchett  - [[Pseudonym|AKA]] Cassetti, kidnapper and murderer of three-year-old Daisy Armstrong. \n*Countess Andrenyi - the sister of Sonia Armstrong, notable because she does not take part in the stabbing murder.\n*Count Andrenyi - the Count takes his wife's place in the stabbing murder.\n*Cyrus Hardman - an American who was in love with Daisy's French nurse who committed suicide after Daisy was killed. \n*Antonio Foscarelli - the Armstrongs' former chauffeur who had loved little Daisy.\n*Greta Ohlsson - Daisy Armstrong's former nurse.\n*Hildegarde Schmidt -  Princess Dragomiroff's maid, formerly the Armstrongs' cook.\n*Edward Henry Masterman - Ratchett's valet, a remote and haughty man, Armstrong's batman in the war and valet in New York.\n*Pierre Michel - father of the suicidal nursemaid of Daisy Armstrong.\n\n==Reception==\nThe ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of 11 January 1934 outlined the plot and concluded that \"The little grey cells solve once more the seemingly insoluble.

An innocent, but perhaps loose-lipped, maid employed by Lindbergh's parents was suspected of involvement in the crime.

Nishizawa stabbed Nagashima in the chest and took control of the plane, at one point descending to an altitude of {{convert|300|m}}.\n\nAt 12:09 P.M. [[Time in Japan|JST]], crew members managed to subdue Nishizawa, and co-pilot Koga got back into the cockpit, telling the air traffic controllers, \"It's an emergency. The captain was stabbed. Prepare an ambulance.\" The plane made an emergency landing at Haneda Airport at 12:14 P.M. and Nishizawa was immediately arrested. A doctor confirmed the death of Nagashima, of [[Yokohama]], shortly after the plane landed. Nishizawa was charged with [[murder]].\n\n==Security exploit==\nNishizawa had smuggled the knife aboard the aircraft by exploiting multiple security flaws at Haneda. He had discovered that it was possible to access the departure gates from the luggage claim area without going through security checks. He first checked-in for a [[Japan Airlines|JAL]] round-trip flight from Tokyo to Osaka with the knife in his checked baggage while also checking in for Flight 61; upon return to Tokyo he retrieved his baggage (with the knife) from the Osaka flight, and carried the knife (and the bag) aboard Flight 61 as carry-on luggage.\n\nHe had originally planned to carry out the hijacking one day earlier, on July 22. He had told his parents and psychiatrist that he was traveling alone to Hokkaido, but his parents had discovered his bags containing multiple airline tickets and the knife, causing him to delay his plans for one day. Nishizawa had booked tickets on multiple departing flights: in addition to Flight 61 for New Chitose, he had tickets for ANA Flight 083 for Naha which left ten minutes earlier than Flight 61, and Flight 851 for Hakodate.\n\nNishizawa had discovered the security flaw a month before the hijacking, and after confirming it on a round-trip flight to Kumamoto, sent letters to the Ministry of Transport, All Nippon Airways, and other agencies, in addition to major newspapers, notifying them of it. Additionally, he requested employment by the airport as a security guard. The airport made one telephone call in response, but no further action was taken until after the hijacking, when procedures were revised comprehensively throughout Japan's airports, eliminating the security flaw.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNishizawa, born September 8, 1970, in [[Tokyo]] was, at the time, a 28-year-old unemployed man from the ward of [[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa]] in Tokyo.  During the investigation, it was revealed that Nishizawa had taken a large dose of [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] medication (which are [[antidepressant]]s used in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]) before the episode, and he said that he hijacked the plane because he wanted to fly it under the [[Rainbow Bridge (Tokyo)|Rainbow Bridge]] in Tokyo. He was also found, in an examination commissioned by his defense attorney, to have [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssristories.org/show.php?item=607 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810070312/http://www.ssristories.org/show.php?item=607 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref> On March 23, 2005, he was found guilty but of unsound mind; therefore, he was only [[Diminished responsibility|partly responsible]] for his actions.

Nishizawa stabbed Nagashima in the chest and took control of the plane, at one point descending to an altitude of {{convert|300|m}}.\n\nAt 12:09 P.M. [[Time in Japan|JST]], crew members managed to subdue Nishizawa, and co-pilot Koga got back into the cockpit, telling the air traffic controllers, \"It's an emergency. The captain was stabbed. Prepare an ambulance.\" The plane made an emergency landing at Haneda Airport at 12:14 P.M. and Nishizawa was immediately arrested. A doctor confirmed the death of Nagashima, of [[Yokohama]], shortly after the plane landed. Nishizawa was charged with [[murder]].\n\n==Security exploit==\nNishizawa had smuggled the knife aboard the aircraft by exploiting multiple security flaws at Haneda. He had discovered that it was possible to access the departure gates from the luggage claim area without going through security checks. He first checked-in for a [[Japan Airlines|JAL]] round-trip flight from Tokyo to Osaka with the knife in his checked baggage while also checking in for Flight 61; upon return to Tokyo he retrieved his baggage (with the knife) from the Osaka flight, and carried the knife (and the bag) aboard Flight 61 as carry-on luggage.\n\nHe had originally planned to carry out the hijacking one day earlier, on July 22. He had told his parents and psychiatrist that he was traveling alone to Hokkaido, but his parents had discovered his bags containing multiple airline tickets and the knife, causing him to delay his plans for one day. Nishizawa had booked tickets on multiple departing flights: in addition to Flight 61 for New Chitose, he had tickets for ANA Flight 083 for Naha which left ten minutes earlier than Flight 61, and Flight 851 for Hakodate.\n\nNishizawa had discovered the security flaw a month before the hijacking, and after confirming it on a round-trip flight to Kumamoto, sent letters to the Ministry of Transport, All Nippon Airways, and other agencies, in addition to major newspapers, notifying them of it. Additionally, he requested employment by the airport as a security guard. The airport made one telephone call in response, but no further action was taken until after the hijacking, when procedures were revised comprehensively throughout Japan's airports, eliminating the security flaw.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nNishizawa, born September 8, 1970, in [[Tokyo]] was, at the time, a 28-year-old unemployed man from the ward of [[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa]] in Tokyo.  During the investigation, it was revealed that Nishizawa had taken a large dose of [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] medication (which are [[antidepressant]]s used in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]) before the episode, and he said that he hijacked the plane because he wanted to fly it under the [[Rainbow Bridge (Tokyo)|Rainbow Bridge]] in Tokyo. He was also found, in an examination commissioned by his defense attorney, to have [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssristories.org/show.php?item=607 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810070312/http://www.ssristories.org/show.php?item=607 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref> On March 23, 2005, he was found guilty but of unsound mind; therefore, he was only [[Diminished responsibility|partly responsible]] for his actions.

Following this case, the practice of publishing suspects' names in similar circumstances increased in Japanese tabloids and news weeklies, and eventually, national newspapers and news agencies.\n\nThe family of Nagashima sued All Nippon Airways, the Japanese state and Nishizawa's family, over Nagashima's death, alleging that poor security at the airport and aboard the plane led to the incident.
