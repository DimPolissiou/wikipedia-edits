Often, its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. If a [[multivariate dataset]] is visualised as a set of coordinates in a high-[[Dimension (metadata)|dimensional]] data space (1 axis per variable), PCA can supply the user with a lower-dimensional picture, a projection of this object when viewed from its most informative viewpoint.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced.\n\nPCA is closely related to [[factor analysis]].  Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix.\n\nPCA is also related to [[Canonical correlation|canonical correlation analysis (CCA)]]. CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new [[orthogonal coordinate system]] that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Barnett, T.

If some axis of the ellipsoid is small, then the variance along that axis is also small, and by omitting that axis and its corresponding principal component from our representation of the dataset, we lose only an equally small amount of information.\n\nTo find the axes of the ellipsoid, we must first subtract the mean of each variable from the dataset to center the data around the origin. Then, we compute the [[covariance matrix]] of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix. Then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to become unit vectors. Once this is done, each of the mutually orthogonal, unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data. This choice of basis will transform our covariance matrix into a diagonalised form with the diagonal elements representing the variance of each axis. The proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nThis procedure is sensitive to the scaling of the data, and there is no consensus as to how to best scale the data to obtain optimal results.{{Citation needed|reason=This contradicts the earlier instruction about normalization. It seems like a bomb drop in a section about central concepts that should be intuitive.|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Details ==\nPCA is defined as an [[orthogonal transformation|orthogonal]] [[linear transformation]] that transforms the data to a new [[coordinate system]] such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.<ref name=\"Principal Component Analysis\" />\n\nConsider a data [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], '''X''', with column-wise zero [[empirical mean]] (the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero), where each of the ''n'' rows represents a different repetition of the experiment, and each of the ''p'' columns gives a particular kind of feature (say, the results from a particular sensor).\n\nMathematically, the transformation is defined by a set of ''p''-dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients <math>\\mathbf{w}_{(k)} = (w_1, \\dots, w_p)_{(k)} </math> that map each row vector <math>\\mathbf{x}_{(i)}</math> of '''X''' to a new vector of principal component ''scores'' <math>\\mathbf{t}_{(i)} = (t_1, \\dots, t_l)_{(i)}</math>, given by\n\n:<math>{t_{k}}_{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}_{(i)} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{(k)} \\qquad \\mathrm{for} \\qquad i = 1,\\dots,n \\qquad k = 1,\\dots,l </math>\nin such a way that the individual variables <math>t_1, \\dots, t_l</math> of '''t''' considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from '''X''', with each coefficient vector '''w''' constrained to be a [[unit vector]] (where <math>l</math> is usually selected to be less than <math>p</math> to reduce dimensionality).\n\n=== First component ===\nIn order to maximize variance, the first weight vector '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> thus has to satisfy\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(1)}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\,\\left\\{ \\sum_i \\left(t_1\\right)^2_{(i)} \\right\\}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\,\\left\\{ \\sum_i \\left(\\mathbf{x}_{(i)} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\right)^2 \\right\\}</math>\n\nEquivalently, writing this in matrix form gives\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(1)}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\{ \\Vert \\mathbf{Xw} \\Vert^2 \\}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{X^T} \\mathbf{X w} \\right\\}</math>\n\nSince '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> has been defined to be a unit vector, it equivalently also satisfies\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(1)} = {\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{X^T} \\mathbf{X w}}{\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w}} \\right\\}</math>\n\nThe quantity to be maximised can be recognised as a [[Rayleigh quotient]]. A standard result for a [[positive semidefinite matrix]] such as  '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' is that the quotient's maximum possible value is the largest [[eigenvalue]] of the matrix, which occurs when '''''w''''' is the corresponding [[eigenvector]].\n\nWith '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> found, the first principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can then be given as a score ''t''<sub>1(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>.\n\n=== Further components ===\nThe ''k''th component can be found by subtracting the first ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 principal components from '''X''':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} = \\mathbf{X} - \\sum_{s = 1}^{k - 1} \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)}^{\\rm T} </math>\n\nand then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(k)} = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\left\\{ \\Vert \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w} \\Vert^2 \\right\\} = {\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\tfrac{\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k}^T \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w}} \\right\\}</math>\n\nIt turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues. Thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe ''k''th principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can therefore be given as a score ''t''<sub>''k''(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, where '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> is the ''k''th eigenvector of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe full principal components decomposition of '''X''' can therefore be given as\n:<math>\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}</math>\nwhere '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.  The transpose of '''W''' is sometimes called the [[whitening transformation|whitening or sphering transformation]].

However eigenvectors '''w'''<sub>(''j'')</sub> and '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> corresponding to eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal (if the eigenvalues are different), or can be orthogonalised (if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value).  The product in the final line is therefore zero; there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset.\n\nAnother way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix.\n\nIn matrix form, the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q} \\propto \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{W}^T</math>\n\nThe empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes\n:<math>\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{W} \\propto \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\, \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\, \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W}\n=  \\mathbf{\\Lambda} </math>\n\nwhere '''\u039b''' is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. \u03bb<sub>(k)</sub> is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component ''k'', that is, ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ''t''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>2</sup><sub>(''i'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ('''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.\n\n=== Dimensionality reduction ===\nThe transformation '''T''' = '''X''' '''W''' maps a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> from an original space of ''p'' variables to a new space of ''p'' variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset.  However, not all the principal components need to be kept.  Keeping only the first ''L'' principal components, produced by using only the first ''L'' eigenvectors, gives the truncated transformation\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L</math>\n\nwhere the matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> now has ''n'' rows but only ''L'' columns.

For example, selecting ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two-dimensional plane through the high-dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out, so if the data contains [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] these too may be most spread out, and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two-dimensional diagram; whereas if two directions through the data (or two of the original variables) are chosen at random, the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other, and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSimilarly, in [[regression analysis]], the larger the number of [[explanatory variable]]s allowed, the greater is the chance of [[overfitting]] the model, producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets.  One approach, especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables, is to reduce them to a few principal components and then run the regression against them, a method called [[principal component regression]].\n\nDimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy.  If each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed Gaussian noise, then the columns of '''T''' will also contain similarly identically distributed Gaussian noise (such a distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix '''W''', which can be thought of as a high-dimensional rotation of the co-ordinate axes).  However, with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less\u2014the first few components achieve a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]].  PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later principal components may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss.\n\n=== Singular value decomposition ===\nThe principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization, the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) of '''X''',\n:<math>\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T</math>\nHere '''\u03a3''' is an ''n''-by-''p'' [[Diagonal matrix|rectangular diagonal matrix]] of positive numbers ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, called the singular values of '''X'''; '''U''' is an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix, the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''n'' called the left singular vectors of '''X'''; and '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''p'' and called the right singular vectors of '''X'''.\n\nIn terms of this factorization, the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}}^2 \\mathbf{W}^T\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}} </math>''' is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of ''' X ''' and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}^2}=\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} </math>'''. Comparison with the eigenvector factorization of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' establishes that the right singular vectors '''W''' of '''X''' are equivalent to the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', while the singular values ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of ''' <math> \\mathbf{{X}}</math>''' are equal to the square-root of the eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nUsing the singular value decomposition the score matrix '''T''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{T} & = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\n\\end{align}</math>\nso each column of '''T''' is given by one of the left singular vectors of '''X''' multiplied by the corresponding singular value. This form is also the [[polar decomposition]] of '''T'''.\n\nEfficient algorithms exist to calculate the SVD of '''X''' without having to form the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', so computing the SVD is now the standard way to calculate a principal components analysis from a data matrix{{citation needed|reason=A reference to SVD algorithms that outperform eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is needed, particularly in cases where n is greater than p|date=August 2014}}, unless only a handful of components are required.\n\nAs with the eigen-decomposition, a truncated {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''L''}} score matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> can be obtained by considering only the first L largest singular values and their singular vectors:\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{U}_L\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L </math>\nThe truncation of a matrix '''M''' or '''T''' using a truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces a truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] ''L'' to the original matrix, in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible [[Frobenius norm]], a result known as the Eckart\u2013Young theorem [1936].\n\n== Further considerations ==\n\nGiven a set of points in [[Euclidean space]], the first principal component corresponds to a line that passes through the multidimensional mean and minimizes the sum of squares of the distances of the points from the line. The second principal component corresponds to the same concept after all correlation with the first principal component has been subtracted from the points. The singular values (in '''\u03a3''') are the square roots of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. Each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the \"variance\" (more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean) that is associated with each eigenvector. The sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean. PCA essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components. This moves as much of the variance as possible (using an orthogonal transformation) into the first few dimensions. The values in the remaining dimensions, therefore, tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information (see [[Principle Component Analysis#PCA and information theory|below]]). PCA is often used in this manner for [[dimensionality reduction]]. PCA has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest \"variance\" (as defined above). This advantage, however, comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared, for example, and when applicable, to the [[discrete cosine transform]], and in particular to the DCT-II which is simply known as the \"DCT\". [[Nonlinear dimensionality reduction]] techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than PCA.\n\nPCA is sensitive to the scaling of the variables. If we have just two variables and they have the same [[sample variance]] and are positively correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45\u00b0 and the \"weights\" (they are the cosines of rotation) for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal. But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable. This means that whenever the different variables have different units (like temperature and mass), PCA is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis. (Different results would be obtained if one used Fahrenheit rather than Celsius for example.) Pearson's original paper was entitled \"On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space\" \u2013 \"in space\" implies physical Euclidean space where such concerns do not arise. One way of making the PCA less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance, by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for PCA. However, this compresses (or expands) the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance.\n\nMean subtraction (a.k.a. \"mean centering\") is necessary for performing classical PCA to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance. If mean subtraction is not performed, the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data. A mean of zero is needed for finding a basis that minimizes the [[Minimum mean square error|mean square error]] of the approximation of the data.<ref>A. A. Miranda, Y. A. Le Borgne, and G. Bontempi.

Then the trace of <math>\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_y</math>, denoted <math>\\text{tr} (\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_y)</math>, is maximized by taking <math>\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{A}_q</math>, where <math>\\mathbf{A}_q</math> consists of the first ''q'' columns of <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> <math>(\\mathbf{B'}</math> is the transposition of <math>\\mathbf{B})</math>.\n\n:<big>'''''Property 2'':'''</big> Consider again the [[orthonormal transformation]]\n::<math>y = \\mathbf{B'}x</math>\n:with <math>x, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{A}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_y</math> defined as before.

Because these last PCs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right. They can help to detect unsuspected near-constant linear relationships between the elements of {{mvar|x}}, and they may also be useful in [[regression analysis|regression]], in selecting a subset of variables from {{mvar|x}}, and in outlier detection.\n\n:<big>'''''Property 3'':'''</big> (Spectral Decomposition of {{math|'''\u03a3'''}})\n::<math>\\mathbf{{\\Sigma}} = \\lambda_{1}\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{1}' + \\cdots + \\lambda_{p}\\alpha_{p}\\alpha_{p}'</math>\n\nBefore we look at its usage, we first look at [[diagonal]] elements,\n:<math>\\text{Var}(x_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^P \\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{kj}^2</math>\nThen, perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of {{mvar|x}} into decreasing contributions due to each PC, but we can also decompose the whole [[covariance matrix]] into contributions <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> from each PC. Although not strictly decreasing, the elements of <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> will tend to become smaller as <math>k</math> increases, as <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> is nonincreasing for increasing <math>k</math>, whereas the elements of <math>\\alpha_{k}</math> tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints: <math>\\alpha_{k}'\\alpha_{k}=1, k=1,\\cdots, p</math>.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n\nAs noted above, the results of PCA depend on the scaling of the variables. This can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation, so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance <ref name=Leznik>Leznik, M; Tofallis, C. 2005 [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/715/S56.pdf Estimating Invariant Principal Components Using Diagonal Regression.]</ref>\n\nThe applicability of PCA as described above is limited by certain (tacit) assumptions <ref>Jonathon Shlens, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100 A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis.]</ref> made in its derivation. In particular, PCA can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated (see Figure 6a in the reference). In some cases, coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and PCA can then be applied (see [[Kernel principal component analysis|kernel PCA]]).\n\nAnother limitation is the mean-removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for PCA. In fields such as astronomy, all the signals are non-negative, and the mean-removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero, which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes,<ref name=\"soummer12\"/> and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals.<ref name=\"pueyo16\">{{Cite journal|arxiv= 1604.06097 |last1= Pueyo|first1= Laurent |title= Detection and Characterization of Exoplanets using Projections on Karhunen Loeve Eigenimages: Forward Modeling |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 824|issue= 2|pages= 117|year= 2016|doi= 10.3847/0004-637X/824/2/117|bibcode = 2016ApJ...824..117P}}</ref> As an alternative method, [[non-negative matrix factorization]] focusing only on the non-negative elements in the matrices, which is well-suited for astrophysical observations.<ref name=\"blantonRoweis07\"/><ref name=\"zhu16\"/><ref name=\"ren18\"/> See more at [[Principal component analysis#Non-negative matrix factorization|Relation between PCA and Non-negative Matrix Factorization]].\n\n=== PCA and information theory ===\nDimensionality reduction loses information, in general.

The covariance-free approach avoids the {{math|''np''<sup>2</sup>}} operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X'''}}, instead utilizing one of [[matrix-free methods]], for example, based on the function evaluating the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}} at the cost of {{math|''2np''}} operations.\n\n=== Iterative computation ===\n\nOne way to compute the first principal component efficiently<ref name=\"roweis\">Roweis, Sam. \"EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. Ed. Michael I. Jordan, Michael J. Kearns, and Sara A. Solla The MIT Press, 1998.</ref> is shown in the following pseudo-code, for a data matrix {{math|'''X'''}} with zero mean, without ever computing its covariance matrix.\n\n {{math|'''r'''}} = a random vector of length {{mvar|p}}\n {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|}</math>}}\n do {{mvar|c}} times:\n       {{math|1='''s''' = 0}} (a vector of length {{mvar|p}})\n       {{nowrap|for each row <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{X}</math>}}\n             {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s} + (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{x}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue = \\mathbf{r}^T\\mathbf{s}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>error = |eigenvalue\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}|</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{|\\mathbf{s}|}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|exit if <math>error < tolerance</math>}}\n return {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue, \\mathbf{r}</math>}}\n\nThis [[power iteration]] algorithm simply calculates the vector {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}}, normalizes, and places the result back in {{math|'''r'''}}. The eigenvalue is approximated by {{math|'''r<sup>T</sup> (X<sup>T</sup>X) r'''}}, which is the [[Rayleigh quotient]] on the unit vector {{math|'''r'''}} for the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X '''}}. If the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one, the vector {{math|'''r'''}} gets close to the first principal component of {{math|'''X'''}} within the number of iterations {{mvar|c}}, which is small relative to {{mvar|p}}, at the total cost {{math|''2cnp''}}. The [[power iteration]] convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced [[matrix-free methods]], such as the [[Lanczos algorithm]] or the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ([[LOBPCG]]) method.\n\nSubsequent principal components can be computed one-by-one via deflation or simultaneously as a block. In the former approach, imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components, thus increasing the error with every new computation. The latter approach in the block power method replaces single-vectors {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''s'''}} with block-vectors, matrices {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''S'''}}. Every column of {{math|'''R'''}} approximates one of the leading principal components, while all columns are iterated simultaneously. The main calculation is evaluation of the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X R)'''}}.

For example, many quantitative variables have been measured on plants. For these plants, some qualitative variables are available as, for example, the species to which the plant belongs. These data were subjected to PCA for quantitative variables. When analyzing the results, it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable ''species''.\nFor this, the following results are produced.\n* Identification, on the factorial planes, of the different species, for example, using different colors.\n* Representation, on the factorial planes, of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species.\n* For each center of gravity and each axis,  p-value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin.\n\nThese results are what is called ''introducing a qualitative variable as supplementary element''. This procedure is detailed in and Husson, L\u00ea & Pag\u00e8s 2009 and Pag\u00e8s 2013.\nFew software offer this option in an \"automatic\" way. This is the case of [http://www.coheris.com/produits/analytics/logiciel-data-mining/ SPAD] that historically, following the work of [[Ludovic Lebart]], was the first to propose this option, and the R package [http://factominer.free.fr/ FactoMineR].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Quantitative finance ===\n{{See also|Portfolio optimization}}\nIn [[quantitative finance]], principal component analysis can be directly applied to the [[risk management]] of [[interest rate derivative]] portfolios.<ref name=PHIRS>[http://www.tradinginterestrates.com The Pricing and Hedging of Interest Rate Derivatives: A Practical Guide to Swaps], J H M Darbyshire, 2016, {{isbn|978-0995455511}}</ref> Trading multiple [[swap (finance)|swap instruments]] which are usually a function of 30-500 other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually 3 or 4 principal components, representing the path of interest rates on a macro basis.

(2000).</ref> This technique is known as [[Spike-triggered covariance|spike-triggered covariance analysis]]. In a typical application an experimenter presents a [[white noise]] process as a stimulus (usually either as a sensory input to a test subject, or as a [[Electric current|current]] injected directly into the neuron) and records a train of action potentials, or spikes, produced by the neuron as a result. Presumably, certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike. In order to extract these features, the experimenter calculates the [[covariance matrix]] of the ''spike-triggered ensemble'', the set of all stimuli (defined and discretized over a finite time window, typically on the order of 100 ms) that immediately preceded a spike. The [[Eigenvectors and eigenvalues|eigenvectors]] of the difference between the spike-triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the ''prior stimulus ensemble'' (the set of all stimuli, defined over the same length time window) then indicate the directions in the [[Vector space|space]] of stimuli along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble. Specifically, the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the variance of the prior. Since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to a spike, they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features.\n\nIn neuroscience, PCA is also used to discern the identity of a neuron from the shape of its action potential. [[Spike sorting]] is an important procedure because [[Electrophysiology#Extracellular recording|extracellular]] recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron. In spike sorting, one first uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms, and then performs [[Cluster analysis|clustering analysis]] to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons.\n\nPCA as a dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles. It has been used in determining collective variables, that is, [[order parameters]], during [[phase transitions]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jirsa|first1=Victor|last2=Friedrich|first2=R|last3=Haken|first3=Herman|last4=Kelso|first4=Scott|title=A theoretical model of phase transitions in the human brain|journal=Biological Cybernetics|date=1994|volume=71|issue=1|pages=27\u201335|doi=10.1007/bf00198909|pmid=8054384}}</ref>\n\n== Relation with other methods ==\n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\n[[Correspondence analysis]] (CA)\nwas developed by [[Jean-Paul Benz\u00e9cri]]<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Benz\u00e9cri, J.-P.\n | publisher=Dunod |location= Paris, France\n | year = 1973\n | title = L'Analyse des Donn\u00e9es.

The new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal. The PCA transformation can be helpful as a pre-processing step before clustering. PCA is a variance-focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance, in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable. PCA is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction (that is, translating variable space into optimal factor space) but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors.\n\n[[Factor analysis]] is similar to principal component analysis, in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables. Different from PCA, factor analysis is a correlation-focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter-correlations among variables, in which the factors \"represent the common variance of variables, excluding unique variance\".<ref>Timothy A. Brown. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDb3BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research Methodology in the social sciences]. Guilford Press, 2006</ref> In terms of the correlation matrix, this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off-diagonal terms (that is, shared co-variance), while PCA focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal. However, as a side result, when trying to reproduce the on-diagonal terms, PCA also tends to fit relatively well the off-diagonal correlations.<ref>I.T. Jolliffe. Principal Component Analysis, Second Edition. Chapter 7. 2002</ref> Results given by PCA and factor analysis are very similar in most situations, but this is not always the case, and there are some problems where the results are significantly different. Factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure (that is, latent constructs or factors) or causal modeling. If the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met, then factor analysis will give erroneous results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Meglen|first1=R.R. |title=Examining Large Databases: A Chemometric Approach Using Principal Component Analysis|journal=Journal of Chemometrics |volume=5 |issue=3|pages=163\u2013179 |date=1991 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180050305 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''K''-means clustering ===\nIt was asserted in <ref>{{cite journal|author=H.

Often, its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. If a [[multivariate dataset]] is visualised as a set of coordinates in a high-[[Dimension (metadata)|dimensional]] data space (1 axis per variable), PCA can supply the user with a lower-dimensional picture, a projection of this object when viewed from its most informative viewpoint.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced.\n\nPCA is closely related to [[factor analysis]].  Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix.\n\nPCA is also related to [[Canonical correlation|canonical correlation analysis (CCA)]]. CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new [[orthogonal coordinate system]] that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Barnett, T.

If some axis of the ellipsoid is small, then the variance along that axis is also small, and by omitting that axis and its corresponding principal component from our representation of the dataset, we lose only an equally small amount of information.\n\nTo find the axes of the ellipsoid, we must first subtract the mean of each variable from the dataset to center the data around the origin. Then, we compute the [[covariance matrix]] of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix. Then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to become unit vectors. Once this is done, each of the mutually orthogonal, unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data. This choice of basis will transform our covariance matrix into a diagonalised form with the diagonal elements representing the variance of each axis. The proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nThis procedure is sensitive to the scaling of the data, and there is no consensus as to how to best scale the data to obtain optimal results.{{Citation needed|reason=This contradicts the earlier instruction about normalization.

A standard result for a [[positive semidefinite matrix]] such as  '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' is that the quotient's maximum possible value is the largest [[eigenvalue]] of the matrix, which occurs when '''''w''''' is the corresponding [[eigenvector]].\n\nWith '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> found, the first principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can then be given as a score ''t''<sub>1(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>.\n\n=== Further components ===\nThe ''k''th component can be found by subtracting the first ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 principal components from '''X''':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} = \\mathbf{X} - \\sum_{s = 1}^{k - 1} \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)}^{\\rm T} </math>\n\nand then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(k)} = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\left\\{ \\Vert \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w} \\Vert^2 \\right\\} = {\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\tfrac{\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k}^T \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w}} \\right\\}</math>\n\nIt turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues. Thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe ''k''th principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can therefore be given as a score ''t''<sub>''k''(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, where '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> is the ''k''th eigenvector of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe full principal components decomposition of '''X''' can therefore be given as\n:<math>\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}</math>\nwhere '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.

Columns of '''W''' multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues, that is, eigenvectors scaled up by the variances, are called ''loadings'' in PCA or in Factor analysis.\n\n=== Covariances ===\n'''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' itself can be recognised as proportional to the empirical sample [[covariance matrix]] of the dataset '''X<sup>T</sup>'''.\n\nThe sample covariance ''Q'' between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nQ(\\mathrm{PC}_{(j)}, \\mathrm{PC}_{(k)}) & \\propto (\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}_{(j)})^T (\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}_{(k)}) \\\\\n& = \\mathbf{w}_{(j)}^T \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_{(k)} \\\\\n& = \\mathbf{w}_{(j)}^T \\lambda_{(k)} \\mathbf{w}_{(k)} \\\\\n& = \\lambda_{(k)} \\mathbf{w}_{(j)}^T \\mathbf{w}_{(k)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the eigenvalue property of '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> has been used to move from line 2 to line 3.  However eigenvectors '''w'''<sub>(''j'')</sub> and '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> corresponding to eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal (if the eigenvalues are different), or can be orthogonalised (if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value).  The product in the final line is therefore zero; there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset.\n\nAnother way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix.\n\nIn matrix form, the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q} \\propto \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{W}^T</math>\n\nThe empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes\n:<math>\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{W} \\propto \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\, \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\, \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W}\n=  \\mathbf{\\Lambda} </math>\n\nwhere '''\u039b''' is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. \u03bb<sub>(k)</sub> is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component ''k'', that is, ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ''t''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>2</sup><sub>(''i'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ('''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.\n\n=== Dimensionality reduction ===\nThe transformation '''T''' = '''X''' '''W''' maps a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> from an original space of ''p'' variables to a new space of ''p'' variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset.  However, not all the principal components need to be kept.  Keeping only the first ''L'' principal components, produced by using only the first ''L'' eigenvectors, gives the truncated transformation\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L</math>\n\nwhere the matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> now has ''n'' rows but only ''L'' columns. In other words, PCA learns a linear transformation <math> t = W^T x, x \\in R^p, t \\in R^L,</math> where the columns of {{math|''p'' \u00d7 ''L''}} matrix ''W'' form an orthogonal basis for the ''L'' features (the components of representation ''t'') that are decorrelated.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bengio, Y.|year=2013|title=Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1798\u20131828 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2013.50|pmid=23787338|display-authors=etal|arxiv=1206.5538}}</ref> By construction, of all the transformed data matrices with only ''L'' columns, this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved, while minimising the total squared reconstruction error <math>\\|\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{W}^T - \\mathbf{T}_L\\mathbf{W}^T_L\\|_2^2</math> or <math>\\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{X}_L\\|_2^2</math>.\n\n[[File:PCA of Haplogroup J using 37 STRs.png|thumb|right|A principal components analysis scatterplot of [[Y-STR]] [[haplotype]]s calculated from repeat-count values for 37 Y-chromosomal STR markers from 354 individuals.<br />  PCA has successfully found linear combinations of the different markers, that separate out different clusters corresponding to different lines of individuals' Y-chromosomal genetic descent.]]\nSuch [[dimensionality reduction]] can be a very useful step for visualising and processing high-dimensional datasets, while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible.  For example, selecting ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two-dimensional plane through the high-dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out, so if the data contains [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] these too may be most spread out, and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two-dimensional diagram; whereas if two directions through the data (or two of the original variables) are chosen at random, the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other, and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSimilarly, in [[regression analysis]], the larger the number of [[explanatory variable]]s allowed, the greater is the chance of [[overfitting]] the model, producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets.  One approach, especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables, is to reduce them to a few principal components and then run the regression against them, a method called [[principal component regression]].\n\nDimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy.  If each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed Gaussian noise, then the columns of '''T''' will also contain similarly identically distributed Gaussian noise (such a distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix '''W''', which can be thought of as a high-dimensional rotation of the co-ordinate axes).  However, with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less\u2014the first few components achieve a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]].  PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later principal components may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss.\n\n=== Singular value decomposition ===\nThe principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization, the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) of '''X''',\n:<math>\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T</math>\nHere '''\u03a3''' is an ''n''-by-''p'' [[Diagonal matrix|rectangular diagonal matrix]] of positive numbers ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, called the singular values of '''X'''; '''U''' is an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix, the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''n'' called the left singular vectors of '''X'''; and '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''p'' and called the right singular vectors of '''X'''.\n\nIn terms of this factorization, the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}}^2 \\mathbf{W}^T\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}} </math>''' is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of ''' X ''' and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}^2}=\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} </math>'''. Comparison with the eigenvector factorization of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' establishes that the right singular vectors '''W''' of '''X''' are equivalent to the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', while the singular values ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of ''' <math> \\mathbf{{X}}</math>''' are equal to the square-root of the eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nUsing the singular value decomposition the score matrix '''T''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{T} & = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\n\\end{align}</math>\nso each column of '''T''' is given by one of the left singular vectors of '''X''' multiplied by the corresponding singular value. This form is also the [[polar decomposition]] of '''T'''.\n\nEfficient algorithms exist to calculate the SVD of '''X''' without having to form the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', so computing the SVD is now the standard way to calculate a principal components analysis from a data matrix{{citation needed|reason=A reference to SVD algorithms that outperform eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is needed, particularly in cases where n is greater than p|date=August 2014}}, unless only a handful of components are required.\n\nAs with the eigen-decomposition, a truncated {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''L''}} score matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> can be obtained by considering only the first L largest singular values and their singular vectors:\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{U}_L\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L </math>\nThe truncation of a matrix '''M''' or '''T''' using a truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces a truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] ''L'' to the original matrix, in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible [[Frobenius norm]], a result known as the Eckart\u2013Young theorem [1936].\n\n== Further considerations ==\n\nGiven a set of points in [[Euclidean space]], the first principal component corresponds to a line that passes through the multidimensional mean and minimizes the sum of squares of the distances of the points from the line. The second principal component corresponds to the same concept after all correlation with the first principal component has been subtracted from the points. The singular values (in '''\u03a3''') are the square roots of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. Each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the \"variance\" (more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean) that is associated with each eigenvector. The sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean. PCA essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components. This moves as much of the variance as possible (using an orthogonal transformation) into the first few dimensions. The values in the remaining dimensions, therefore, tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information (see [[Principle Component Analysis#PCA and information theory|below]]). PCA is often used in this manner for [[dimensionality reduction]]. PCA has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest \"variance\" (as defined above). This advantage, however, comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared, for example, and when applicable, to the [[discrete cosine transform]], and in particular to the DCT-II which is simply known as the \"DCT\". [[Nonlinear dimensionality reduction]] techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than PCA.\n\nPCA is sensitive to the scaling of the variables. If we have just two variables and they have the same [[sample variance]] and are positively correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45\u00b0 and the \"weights\" (they are the cosines of rotation) for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal. But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable. This means that whenever the different variables have different units (like temperature and mass), PCA is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis. (Different results would be obtained if one used Fahrenheit rather than Celsius for example.) Pearson's original paper was entitled \"On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space\" \u2013 \"in space\" implies physical Euclidean space where such concerns do not arise. One way of making the PCA less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance, by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for PCA. However, this compresses (or expands) the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance.\n\nMean subtraction (a.k.a. \"mean centering\") is necessary for performing classical PCA to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance. If mean subtraction is not performed, the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data. A mean of zero is needed for finding a basis that minimizes the [[Minimum mean square error|mean square error]] of the approximation of the data.<ref>A. A. Miranda, Y. A. Le Borgne, and G. Bontempi. [http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/yleborgn/pub/NPL_PCA_07.pdf New Routes from Minimal Approximation Error to Principal Components], Volume 27, Number 3 / June, 2008, Neural Processing Letters, Springer</ref>\n\nMean-centering is unnecessary if performing a principal components analysis on a correlation matrix, as the data are already centered after calculating correlations. Correlations are derived from the cross-product of two standard scores (Z-scores) or statistical moments (hence the name: ''Pearson Product-Moment Correlation''). Also see the article by Kromrey & Foster-Johnson (1998) on ''\"Mean-centering in Moderated Regression: Much Ado About Nothing\".''\n\nPCA is a popular primary technique in [[pattern recognition]].

Because these last PCs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right. They can help to detect unsuspected near-constant linear relationships between the elements of {{mvar|x}}, and they may also be useful in [[regression analysis|regression]], in selecting a subset of variables from {{mvar|x}}, and in outlier detection.\n\n:<big>'''''Property 3'':'''</big> (Spectral Decomposition of {{math|'''\u03a3'''}})\n::<math>\\mathbf{{\\Sigma}} = \\lambda_{1}\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{1}' + \\cdots + \\lambda_{p}\\alpha_{p}\\alpha_{p}'</math>\n\nBefore we look at its usage, we first look at [[diagonal]] elements,\n:<math>\\text{Var}(x_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^P \\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{kj}^2</math>\nThen, perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of {{mvar|x}} into decreasing contributions due to each PC, but we can also decompose the whole [[covariance matrix]] into contributions <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> from each PC.

This can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation, so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance <ref name=Leznik>Leznik, M; Tofallis, C. 2005 [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/715/S56.pdf Estimating Invariant Principal Components Using Diagonal Regression.]</ref>\n\nThe applicability of PCA as described above is limited by certain (tacit) assumptions <ref>Jonathon Shlens, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100 A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis.]</ref> made in its derivation. In particular, PCA can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated (see Figure 6a in the reference). In some cases, coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and PCA can then be applied (see [[Kernel principal component analysis|kernel PCA]]).\n\nAnother limitation is the mean-removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for PCA. In fields such as astronomy, all the signals are non-negative, and the mean-removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero, which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes,<ref name=\"soummer12\"/> and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals.<ref name=\"pueyo16\">{{Cite journal|arxiv= 1604.06097 |last1= Pueyo|first1= Laurent |title= Detection and Characterization of Exoplanets using Projections on Karhunen Loeve Eigenimages: Forward Modeling |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 824|issue= 2|pages= 117|year= 2016|doi= 10.3847/0004-637X/824/2/117|bibcode = 2016ApJ...824..117P}}</ref> As an alternative method, [[non-negative matrix factorization]] focusing only on the non-negative elements in the matrices, which is well-suited for astrophysical observations.<ref name=\"blantonRoweis07\"/><ref name=\"zhu16\"/><ref name=\"ren18\"/> See more at [[Principal component analysis#Non-negative matrix factorization|Relation between PCA and Non-negative Matrix Factorization]].\n\n=== PCA and information theory ===\nDimensionality reduction loses information, in general.

The covariance-free approach avoids the {{math|''np''<sup>2</sup>}} operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X'''}}, instead utilizing one of [[matrix-free methods]], for example, based on the function evaluating the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}} at the cost of {{math|''2np''}} operations.\n\n=== Iterative computation ===\n\nOne way to compute the first principal component efficiently<ref name=\"roweis\">Roweis, Sam. \"EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. Ed. Michael I. Jordan, Michael J. Kearns, and Sara A. Solla The MIT Press, 1998.</ref> is shown in the following pseudo-code, for a data matrix {{math|'''X'''}} with zero mean, without ever computing its covariance matrix.\n\n {{math|'''r'''}} = a random vector of length {{mvar|p}}\n {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|}</math>}}\n do {{mvar|c}} times:\n       {{math|1='''s''' = 0}} (a vector of length {{mvar|p}})\n       {{nowrap|for each row <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{X}</math>}}\n             {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s} + (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{x}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue = \\mathbf{r}^T\\mathbf{s}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>error = |eigenvalue\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}|</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{|\\mathbf{s}|}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|exit if <math>error < tolerance</math>}}\n return {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue, \\mathbf{r}</math>}}\n\nThis [[power iteration]] algorithm simply calculates the vector {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}}, normalizes, and places the result back in {{math|'''r'''}}. The eigenvalue is approximated by {{math|'''r<sup>T</sup> (X<sup>T</sup>X) r'''}}, which is the [[Rayleigh quotient]] on the unit vector {{math|'''r'''}} for the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X '''}}. If the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one, the vector {{math|'''r'''}} gets close to the first principal component of {{math|'''X'''}} within the number of iterations {{mvar|c}}, which is small relative to {{mvar|p}}, at the total cost {{math|''2cnp''}}. The [[power iteration]] convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced [[matrix-free methods]], such as the [[Lanczos algorithm]] or the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ([[LOBPCG]]) method.\n\nSubsequent principal components can be computed one-by-one via deflation or simultaneously as a block. In the former approach, imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components, thus increasing the error with every new computation. The latter approach in the block power method replaces single-vectors {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''s'''}} with block-vectors, matrices {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''S'''}}. Every column of {{math|'''R'''}} approximates one of the leading principal components, while all columns are iterated simultaneously. The main calculation is evaluation of the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X R)'''}}. Implemented, for example., in [[LOBPCG]], efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors, allows using high-level [[BLAS]] matrix-matrix product functions, and typically leads to faster convergence, compared to the single-vector one-by-one technique.\n\n=== The NIPALS method ===\n''Non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)'' is a variant the classical [[power iteration]] with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in a principal component or [[partial least squares]] analysis. For very-high-dimensional datasets, such as those generated in the *omics sciences (for example, [[genomics]], [[metabolomics]]) it is usually only necessary to compute the first few PCs. The [[non-linear iterative partial least squares]] (NIPALS) algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings '''t<sub>1</sub>''' and '''r<sub>1</sub>'''<sup>T</sup> by the [[power iteration]] multiplying on every iteration by '''X''' on the left and on the right, that is, calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided, just as in the matrix-free implementation of the power iterations to {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X'''}}, based on the function evaluating the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}} = {{math|'''((X r)<sup>T</sup>X)<sup>T</sup>'''}}.\n\nThe matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product, '''t<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>'''<sup>T</sup> from '''X''' leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading PCs.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Geladi\n  | first = Paul\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 = Kowalski\n  | first2 = Bruce\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = Partial Least Squares Regression:A Tutorial\n  | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta\n  | volume = 185\n  | issue =\n  | pages = 1\u201317\n  | year = 1986\n  | url =\n  | doi = 10.1016/0003-2670(86)80028-9\n  | id = }}</ref> \nFor large data matrices, or matrices that have a high degree of column collinearity, NIPALS suffers from loss of orthogonality of PCs due to machine precision [[round-off errors]] accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kramer |first=R. |year=1998 |title=Chemometric Techniques for Quantitative Analysis |publisher=CRC Press |location=New York |isbn= 9780203909805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBpOzwAOfHYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> A [[Gram\u2013Schmidt]] re-orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality.<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Andrecut |title=Parallel GPU Implementation of Iterative PCA Algorithms |journal=Journal of Computational Biology |volume=16 |issue=11 |year=2009 |pages=1593\u20131599 |doi=10.1089/cmb.2008.0221 |pmid=19772385 |arxiv=0811.1081 }}</ref> NIPALS reliance on single-vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high-level [[BLAS]] and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values\u2014both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix-free block solvers, such as the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ([[LOBPCG]]) method.\n\n=== Online/sequential estimation ===\nIn an \"online\" or \"streaming\" situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in a single batch, it is useful to make an estimate of the PCA projection that can be updated sequentially.

For example, many quantitative variables have been measured on plants. For these plants, some qualitative variables are available as, for example, the species to which the plant belongs. These data were subjected to PCA for quantitative variables. When analyzing the results, it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable ''species''.\nFor this, the following results are produced.\n* Identification, on the factorial planes, of the different species, for example, using different colors.\n* Representation, on the factorial planes, of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species.\n* For each center of gravity and each axis,  p-value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin.\n\nThese results are what is called ''introducing a qualitative variable as supplementary element''. This procedure is detailed in and Husson, L\u00ea & Pag\u00e8s 2009 and Pag\u00e8s 2013.\nFew software offer this option in an \"automatic\" way. This is the case of [http://www.coheris.com/produits/analytics/logiciel-data-mining/ SPAD] that historically, following the work of [[Ludovic Lebart]], was the first to propose this option, and the R package [http://factominer.free.fr/ FactoMineR].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Quantitative finance ===\n{{See also|Portfolio optimization}}\nIn [[quantitative finance]], principal component analysis can be directly applied to the [[risk management]] of [[interest rate derivative]] portfolios.<ref name=PHIRS>[http://www.tradinginterestrates.com The Pricing and Hedging of Interest Rate Derivatives: A Practical Guide to Swaps], J H M Darbyshire, 2016, {{isbn|978-0995455511}}</ref> Trading multiple [[swap (finance)|swap instruments]] which are usually a function of 30-500 other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually 3 or 4 principal components, representing the path of interest rates on a macro basis.

(2000).</ref> This technique is known as [[Spike-triggered covariance|spike-triggered covariance analysis]]. In a typical application an experimenter presents a [[white noise]] process as a stimulus (usually either as a sensory input to a test subject, or as a [[Electric current|current]] injected directly into the neuron) and records a train of action potentials, or spikes, produced by the neuron as a result. Presumably, certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike. In order to extract these features, the experimenter calculates the [[covariance matrix]] of the ''spike-triggered ensemble'', the set of all stimuli (defined and discretized over a finite time window, typically on the order of 100 ms) that immediately preceded a spike. The [[Eigenvectors and eigenvalues|eigenvectors]] of the difference between the spike-triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the ''prior stimulus ensemble'' (the set of all stimuli, defined over the same length time window) then indicate the directions in the [[Vector space|space]] of stimuli along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble. Specifically, the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the variance of the prior. Since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to a spike, they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features.\n\nIn neuroscience, PCA is also used to discern the identity of a neuron from the shape of its action potential. [[Spike sorting]] is an important procedure because [[Electrophysiology#Extracellular recording|extracellular]] recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron. In spike sorting, one first uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms, and then performs [[Cluster analysis|clustering analysis]] to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons.\n\nPCA as a dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles. It has been used in determining collective variables, that is, [[order parameters]], during [[phase transitions]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jirsa|first1=Victor|last2=Friedrich|first2=R|last3=Haken|first3=Herman|last4=Kelso|first4=Scott|title=A theoretical model of phase transitions in the human brain|journal=Biological Cybernetics|date=1994|volume=71|issue=1|pages=27\u201335|doi=10.1007/bf00198909|pmid=8054384}}</ref>\n\n== Relation with other methods ==\n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\n[[Correspondence analysis]] (CA)\nwas developed by [[Jean-Paul Benz\u00e9cri]]<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Benz\u00e9cri, J.-P.\n | publisher=Dunod |location= Paris, France\n | year = 1973\n | title = L'Analyse des Donn\u00e9es.

The new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal. The PCA transformation can be helpful as a pre-processing step before clustering. PCA is a variance-focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance, in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable. PCA is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction (that is, translating variable space into optimal factor space) but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors.\n\n[[Factor analysis]] is similar to principal component analysis, in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables. Different from PCA, factor analysis is a correlation-focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter-correlations among variables, in which the factors \"represent the common variance of variables, excluding unique variance\".<ref>Timothy A. Brown. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDb3BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research Methodology in the social sciences]. Guilford Press, 2006</ref> In terms of the correlation matrix, this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off-diagonal terms (that is, shared co-variance), while PCA focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal. However, as a side result, when trying to reproduce the on-diagonal terms, PCA also tends to fit relatively well the off-diagonal correlations.<ref>I.T. Jolliffe. Principal Component Analysis, Second Edition. Chapter 7. 2002</ref> Results given by PCA and factor analysis are very similar in most situations, but this is not always the case, and there are some problems where the results are significantly different. Factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure (that is, latent constructs or factors) or causal modeling. If the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met, then factor analysis will give erroneous results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Meglen|first1=R.R. |title=Examining Large Databases: A Chemometric Approach Using Principal Component Analysis|journal=Journal of Chemometrics |volume=5 |issue=3|pages=163\u2013179 |date=1991 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180050305 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''K''-means clustering ===\nIt was asserted in <ref>{{cite journal|author=H.

And the Jews and the Christians even though both of them are misguided and both of them have Allaah's Anger on them - the Anger is specified to the Jews, even though the Christians share this with them because the Jews knew the truth and rejected it and deliberately came with falsehood, so the Anger (of Allaah being upon them) was the description most befitting them. And the Christians were ignorant, not knowing the truth, so misguidance was the description most befitting them.  So with this the saying of Allaah, 'so they have drawn on themselves anger upon anger' (2:90) clarifies that the Jews are those that 'have earned your Anger'.

When he returned, we asked our friend, \"Did you know how to treat with the recitation of something?\" He said, \"No, but I treated him only with the recitation of the Mother of the Book (i.e. Al-Fatiha).\" We said, \"Do not say anything (about it) till we reach or ask the Prophet so when we reached Medina, we mentioned that to the Prophet (to know whether the sheep which we had taken were lawful to take or not). The Prophet said, \"How did he come to know that it (Al-Fatiha) could be used for treatment?

Then Muhammad asked, \"Jabir, should I tell you something about this surah?\" Jabir answered, \"Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O Messenger of Allah.\" Muhammad said, \"It (Surah al-Fatihah) is a cure for every ailment except death.\" <ref name=\"Virtue\" /><ref name=\"Authentic\" /><ref name=\"Bukhari\" /><ref name=\"Merit\" /><ref name=\"Reward\" />\n\nImam Abu Abdillah Ja'far as-Sadiq said that whoever cannot be cured by Surah al-Fatihah, then there is no cure for that person. In the same narration it is written that if this surah is recited 70 times on any part of the body that is aching, the pain will surely go away. In fact, the power of this surah is so great that it is said that if one were to recite it 70 times over a dead body, you should not become surprised if that body starts moving (i.e. comes back to life). Surah al-Fatihah is a cure for physical and also spiritual ailments.<ref name=\"Virtue\" /><ref name=\"Authentic\" /><ref name=\"Bukhari\" /><ref name=\"Merit\" /><ref name=\"Reward\" />\n\n====An experienced way of warding off Jinn or black magic by Muhammad Zakariyya Muhajir Madani====\nThis amal (practice) is known as the amal of Ayatul Kursi. After fajr salaah, maghrib salaah and before retiring to bed, read thrice Surah Fatihah including Bismillah, Aayatul Kursi, Surah Falaq (chapter 113) and Surah Naas (chapter 114). Read any Durood thrice in the beginning as well as at the end. If the affected one recites himself it is better, otherwise, someone else should recite and blow in such a manner that some part of his lips touch the affected person. Also, keep a bottle of water and whatever you read blow in the water at the end and make the affected one drink from that water each morning before doing anything else. When the bottle is halved, fill it up with fresh water. And if some signs of effect are seen within the house, then a portion of that water should be sprinkled in the four corners of the house in such a manner that the water does not fall on the floor.

And the Jews and the Christians even though both of them are misguided and both of them have Allaah's Anger on them - the Anger is specified to the Jews, even though the Christians share this with them because the Jews knew the truth and rejected it and deliberately came with falsehood, so the Anger (of Allaah being upon them) was the description most befitting them. And the Christians were ignorant, not knowing the truth, so misguidance was the description most befitting them.  So with this the saying of Allaah, 'so they have drawn on themselves anger upon anger' (2:90) clarifies that the Jews are those that 'have earned your Anger'.

Then Muhammad asked, \"Jabir, should I tell you something about this surah?\" Jabir answered, \"Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O Messenger of Allah.\" Muhammad said, \"It (Surah al-Fatihah) is a cure for every ailment except death.\" <ref name=\"Virtue\" /><ref name=\"Authentic\" /><ref name=\"Bukhari\" /><ref name=\"Merit\" /><ref name=\"Reward\" />\n\nImam Abu Abdillah Ja'far as-Sadiq said that whoever cannot be cured by Surah al-Fatihah, then there is no cure for that person. In the same narration it is written that if this surah is recited 70 times on any part of the body that is aching, the pain will surely go away. In fact, the power of this surah is so great that it is said that if one were to recite it 70 times over a dead body, you should not become surprised if that body starts moving (i.e. comes back to life). Surah al-Fatihah is a cure for physical and also spiritual ailments.<ref name=\"Virtue\" /><ref name=\"Authentic\" /><ref name=\"Bukhari\" /><ref name=\"Merit\" /><ref name=\"Reward\" />\n\n====An experienced way of warding off Jinn or black magic by Muhammad Zakariyya Muhajir Madani====\nThis amal (practice) is known as the amal of Ayatul Kursi. After fajr salaah, maghrib salaah and before retiring to bed, read thrice Surah Fatihah including Bismillah, Aayatul Kursi, Surah Falaq (chapter 113) and Surah Naas (chapter 114). Read any Durood thrice in the beginning as well as at the end. If the affected one recites himself it is better, otherwise, someone else should recite and blow in such a manner that some part of his lips touch the affected person. Also, keep a bottle of water and whatever you read blow in the water at the end and make the affected one drink from that water each morning before doing anything else. When the bottle is halved, fill it up with fresh water. And if some signs of effect are seen within the house, then a portion of that water should be sprinkled in the four corners of the house in such a manner that the water does not fall on the floor.

The first remix album was the Black Dahlia Remixes album, featuring three remixes of Hollywood Undead's single, \"Black Dahlia\". The album was released on November 21, 2011 by [[A&M/Octone Records]]. The original tracks on the album, which were on ''American Tragedy'', were recorded following the induction of Daniel Murillo into the band in early 2010 and lasted until December. The tracks were then remixed by various DJs and musicians during the band's ''World War III Tour'' with [[Asking Alexandria]] later in 2011. The album's first single, \"[[Levitate (Digital Dog club mix)]]\", was released on October 18, 2011, with a music video being released on October 24.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the release of the band's second studio album, ''[[American Tragedy (album)|American Tragedy]]'', the band announced a remix contest on August 11, 2011, where fans created their own remixes of the tracks \"Le Deux\" and \"Bullet\". The contest winner for the \"Le Deux\" was Dr. Eargasm, whose remix was chosen by the band and is featured on the album. The \"Bullet\" remix was voted as the best remix and was included on ''Redux'' as an [[iTunes]] bonus track. The band announced in October 2011 that a remix album, titled ''American Tragedy Redux'', would be released on November 21, 2011 as their first remix album. The band created a series of online promotions for the album. First, they unlocked the track list and cover art for the album once the album title was tweeted 10,000 times on [[Twitter]], which was accomplished by the end of the second day that the contest started. Then, the band released the first single, \"Levitate (Digital Dog club mix)\", on October 18 once the album art was shared 3,000 times on [[Facebook]]. A music video for \"Levitate (Digital Dog club mix)\" was released on October 24, 2011 through [[Virgin Mobile]].<ref name= \"Hollywood Undead to Premiere Exclusive Remix Video.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zoiksonline.com/2011/10/hollywood-undead-to-premiere-exclusive.html|publisher=Zoinks!

The band also released the \"Comin' In Hot (Wideboys Remix)\" on the pre-order site.

Da Kurlzz felt that the popularity in dance and club music was surging and that inspired the band to create ''Redux'', stating that the band was \"paying attention not only to the rock, hip hop and pop scene, but the dance and DJ club scene is obviously blowing up once again. There's always new DJs remixing some really great artists, showing people that you can mix those genres together.\" Upon deciding which DJs and re-mixers to use for the album, Da Kurlzz stated that the band used decided specifically which of their songs would go best with each artist and how the remixed result would sound. He concluded by saying that they chose the artists, \"not just because we like their music, but we also think that the sound will really be great for the certain songs that we choose.\" Da Kurlzz also stated that the band worked carefully with each artist during the remixing process to ensure the best songs for the album.<ref name= \"Hollywood Undead Loving Tempe, Working With Korn, and Varied Musical Tastes\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2011/10/hollywood_undead_on_their_new.php|publisher=The Phoenix New Times|author=Lauren Wise|title=Hollywood Undead Loving Tempe, Working With Korn, and Varied Musical Tastes|date=October 28, 2011|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> He stated that the remix of \"Hear Me Now\" by [[Jonathan Davis]], which was streamed by [[Revolver Magazine]] on November 14,<ref name= \"Exclusive: Hollywood Undead Premiere 'Hear Me Now' Remixed by Korn's Jonathan Davis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/exclusive-hollywood-undead-premiere-hear-me-now-remixed-by-korns-jonathan-davis.html|publisher=[[Revolver Magazine]]|author=Brandon Geist|title=Exclusive: Hollywood Undead Premiere \"Hear Me Now\" Remixed by Korn's Jonathan Davis|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> was the most difficult but that \"it ended up coming out great and we're really proud of it...\" and that they were able to \"go up to him and personally thank [Davis].\"<ref name= \"Hollywood Undead Loving Tempe, Working With Korn, and Varied Musical Tastes\"/>\n\nCharlie Scene stated that the album came around from touring with several bands, like [[Asking Alexandria]] and [[Korn]], and seeing their experiments with remixing songs.

The first remix album was the Black Dahlia Remixes album, featuring three remixes of Hollywood Undead's single, \"Black Dahlia\". The album was released on November 21, 2011 by [[A&M/Octone Records]]. The original tracks on the album, which were on ''American Tragedy'', were recorded following the induction of Daniel Murillo into the band in early 2010 and lasted until December. The tracks were then remixed by various DJ's and musicians during the band's ''World War III Tour'' with [[Asking Alexandria]] later in 2011. The album's first single, \"[[Levitate (Digital Dog club mix)]]\", was released on October 18, 2011, with a music video being released on October 24.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the release of the band's second studio album, ''[[American Tragedy (album)|American Tragedy]]'', the band announced a remix contest on August 11, 2011, where fans created their own remixes of the tracks \"Le Deux\" and \"Bullet\". The contest winner for the \"Le Deux\" was Dr. Eargasm, whose remix was chosen by the band and is featured on the album. The \"Bullet\" remix was voted as the best remix and was included on ''Redux'' as an [[iTunes]] bonus track. The band announced in October 2011 that a remix album, titled ''American Tragedy Redux'', would be released on November 21, 2011 as their first remix album. The band created a series of online promotions for the album. First, they unlocked the track list and cover art for the album once the album title was tweeted 10,000 times on [[Twitter]], which was accomplished by the end of the second day that the contest started. Then, the band released the first single, \"Levitate (Digital Dog club mix)\", on October 18 once the album art was shared 3,000 times on [[Facebook]]. A music video for \"Levitate (Digital Dog club mix)\" was released on October 24, 2011 through [[Virgin Mobile]].<ref name= \"Hollywood Undead to Premiere Exclusive Remix Video.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zoiksonline.com/2011/10/hollywood-undead-to-premiere-exclusive.html|publisher=Zoinks!

The band also released the \"Comin' In Hot (Wideboys Remix)\" on the pre-order site.

Da Kurlzz felt that the popularity in dance and club music was surging and that inspired the band to create ''Redux'', stating that the band was \"paying attention not only to the rock, hip hop and pop scene, but the dance and DJ club scene is obviously blowing up once again. There's always new DJs remixing some really great artists, showing people that you can mix those genres together.\" Upon deciding which DJ's and re-mixers to use for the album, Da Kurlzz stated that the band used decided specifically which of their songs would go best with each artist and how the remixed result would sound. He concluded by saying that they chose the artists, \"not just because we like their music, but we also think that the sound will really be great for the certain songs that we choose.\" Da Kurlzz also stated that the band worked carefully with each artist during the remixing process to ensure the best songs for the album.<ref name= \"Hollywood Undead Loving Tempe, Working With Korn, and Varied Musical Tastes\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2011/10/hollywood_undead_on_their_new.php|publisher=The Phoenix New Times|author=Lauren Wise|title=Hollywood Undead Loving Tempe, Working With Korn, and Varied Musical Tastes|date=October 28, 2011|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> He stated that the remix of \"Hear Me Now\" by [[Jonathan Davis]], which was streamed by [[Revolver Magazine]] on November 14,<ref name= \"Exclusive: Hollywood Undead Premiere 'Hear Me Now' Remixed by Korn's Jonathan Davis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/exclusive-hollywood-undead-premiere-hear-me-now-remixed-by-korns-jonathan-davis.html|publisher=[[Revolver Magazine]]|author=Brandon Geist|title=Exclusive: Hollywood Undead Premiere \"Hear Me Now\" Remixed by Korn's Jonathan Davis|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> was the most difficult but that \"it ended up coming out great and we're really proud of it...\" and that they were able to \"go up to him and personally thank [Davis].\"<ref name= \"Hollywood Undead Loving Tempe, Working With Korn, and Varied Musical Tastes\"/>\n\nCharlie Scene stated that the album came around from touring with several bands, like [[Asking Alexandria]] and [[Korn]], and seeing their experiments with remixing songs.
