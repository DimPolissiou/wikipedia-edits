{"title_page": "Flintlock", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Musee-historique-lausanne-img 0086.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Flintlock of an 18th-century hunting rifle, with flint missing.]]\n\n'''Flintlock''' is a general term for any [[firearm]] that uses a [[flint]] striking ignition mechanism. The term may also apply to a particular fonghfdgg\nrm of the mechanism itself, also known as the ''[[flintlock mechanism|true flintlock]]'', that was introduced in the early 17th [[century]], and rapidly replaced earlier firearm-ignition technologies, such as the [[matchlock]], the [[wheellock]], and the earlier flintlock mechanisms.\n\nThe true flintlock continued to be in common use for over two centuries, replaced by [[percussion cap]] and, later, the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge-based]] systems in the early-to-mid 19th century. Although long superseded by modern firearms, flintlock weapons enjoy continuing popularity with [[Black powder|black-powder]] shooting enthusiasts.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Thomas Gainsborough - Mr and Mrs Andrews.jpg|thumb|An English gentleman circa 1750 with his flintlock muzzle-loading sporting rifle, in a painting by [[Thomas Gainsborough]].]]\n\nFrench court gunsmith [[Marin le Bourgeoys]] made a [[firearm]] incorporating a flintlock mechanism for King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] shortly after his accession to the throne in 1610.<ref>\"Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\" by [[Jeff Kinard]]. Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004</ref> However, firearms using some form of flint ignition mechanism had already been in use for over half a century. The development of firearm lock mechanisms had proceeded from the [[matchlock]] to [[wheellock]] to the earlier flintlocks ([[snaplock]], [[snaphance]],  [[miquelet]], and [[doglock]]) in the previous two centuries, and each type had been an improvement, contributing design features to later firearms which were useful. Le Bourgeoys fitted these various features together to create what became known as ''the'' flintlock or ''true'' flintlock.\n\nThe new flintlock system quickly became popular, and was known and used in various forms throughout Europe by 1630, although older flintlock systems continued to be used for some time. Examples of early flintlock muskets can be seen in the painting \"Marie de' Medici as Bellona\" by [[Rubens]] (painted around 1622-25).\n\nVarious breech-loading flintlocks were developed starting around 1650. The most popular action has a barrel which was unscrewed from the rest of the gun. Obviously this is more practical on pistols because of the shorter barrel length. This type is known as a [[Queen Anne pistol]] because it was during [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|her reign]] that it became popular (although it was actually introduced in the reign of King [[William III of England|William III]]). Another type has a removable screw plug set into the side or top or bottom of the barrel. A large number of sporting rifles were made with this system, as it allowed easier loading compared with muzzle loading with a tight fitting bullet and patch.\n\nOne of the more successful was the system built by Isaac de la Chaumette starting in 1704. The barrel could be opened by 3 revolutions of the triggerguard, to which it was attached. The plug stayed attached to the barrel and the ball and powder were loaded from the top. This system was improved in the 1770s by Colonel [[Patrick Ferguson]] and 100 experimental rifles used in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The only two flintlock breechloaders to be produced in quantity were the Hall and the Crespi. The first was invented by [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]] and patented c. 1817.<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref> It was issued to the U.S. Army as the [[M1819 Hall rifle|Model 1819 Hall Breech Loading Rifle]].<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref>\n\nThe Hall rifles and carbines were loaded using a combustible [[paper cartridge]] inserted into the upward tilting breechblock. Hall rifles leaked gas from the often poorly fitted action. The same problem affected the muskets produced by Giuseppe Crespi and adopted by the Austrian Army in 1771. Nonetheless, the Crespi System was experimented with by the British during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and percussion Halls guns saw service in the [[American Civil War]].\n\nFlintlock weapons were commonly used until the mid 19th century, when they were replaced by [[percussion lock]] systems. Even though they have long been considered obsolete, flintlock weapons continue to be produced today by manufacturers such as Pedersoli, Euroarms, and Armi Sport. Not only are these weapons used by modern re-enactors, but they are also used for hunting, as many U.S. states have dedicated hunting seasons for black-powder weapons, which includes both flintlock and percussion lock weapons.\n\n==Subtypes==\nFlintlocks may be any type of [[small arm]]: [[long gun]] or [[pistol]], [[smoothbore]] or [[rifle]], [[muzzleloader]] or [[Breechloading|breechloader]].\n\n===Pistols===\n[[File:Pistolet \u00e0 silex Queen Anne IMG 3172.jpg|thumb|Flintlock pistol in \"Queen Anne\" layout, made in Lausanne by Galliard, circa 1760. On display at Morges military museum.]]\nFlintlock pistols were used as self-defense weapons and as a military arm. Their effective range was short, and they were frequently used as an adjunct to a [[sword]] or [[cutlass]]. Pistols were usually smoothbore although some rifled pistols were produced.\n\nFlintlock pistols came in a variety of sizes and styles which often overlap and are not well defined, many of the names we use having been applied by collectors and dealers long after the pistols were obsolete. The smallest were less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} long and the largest were over {{convert|20|in|cm}}. From around the beginning of the 1700s the larger pistols got shorter, so that by the late 1700s the largest would be more like {{convert|16|in|cm}} long. The smallest would fit into a typical pocket or a hand warming muff and could easily be carried by women.\n\nThe largest sizes would be carried in holsters across a horse's back just ahead of the saddle. In-between sizes included the coat pocket pistol, or coat pistol, which would fit into a large pocket, the coach pistol, meant to be carried on or under the seat of a coach in a bag or box, and belt pistols, sometimes equipped with a hook designed to slip over a belt or waistband. Larger pistols were called horse pistols. Arguably the most elegant of the pistol designs was the [[Queen Anne pistol]], which was made in all sizes.\n\nProbably the high point of the mechanical development of the flintlock pistol was the British [[duelling pistol]]; it was highly reliable, water resistant and accurate. External decoration was minimal but craftsmanship was evident, and the internal works were often finished to a higher degree of craftsmanship than the exterior. Dueling pistols were the size of the horse pistols of the late 1700s, around {{convert|16|in|cm}} long and were usually sold in pairs along with accessories in a wooden case with compartments for each piece.\n\n===Muskets===\n{{Main article|Musket}}\n[[Image:Flintlock.jpg|thumb|Flintlock mechanism]]\nFlintlock [[muskets]] were the mainstay of European [[army|armies]] between 1660 and 1840. A musket was a muzzle-loading smoothbore long gun that was loaded with a round lead ball, but it could also be loaded with [[Lead shot|shot]] for [[hunting]]. For military purposes, the weapon was loaded with ball, or a mixture of ball with several large shot (called [[buck and ball]]), and had an effective range of about 75 to 100 metres. Smoothbore weapons that were designed for hunting birds were called \"fowlers.\"  Flintlock muskets tended to be of large caliber and usually had no [[Choke_(firearms)|choke]], allowing them to fire full-caliber balls.\n\nMilitary flintlock muskets tended to weigh approximately ten pounds, as heavier weapons were found to be too cumbersome, and lighter weapons were not rugged or heavy enough to be used in hand-to-hand combat. They were usually designed to be fitted with a bayonet. On flintlocks, the bayonet played a much more significant role, often accounting for a third or more of all battlefield casualties. This is a rather controversial topic in history though, given that casualties list from several battles in the 18th century showed that less than 2% of wounds were caused by bayonets.<ref>Lynn, John A. Giant of the Grand Si\u00e8cle: The French Army, 1610-1715. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1997. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], a celebrated military author of the [[Napoleon]]ic period who served in numerous armies during that period, stated that the majority of bayonet [[charge (warfare)|charge]]s in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contacts were made.<ref>Jomini, Antoine Henri. The Art of War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1971. Print.\n</ref>  Flintlock weapons were not used like modern rifles. They tended to be fired in mass volleys, followed by bayonet charges in which the weapons were used much like the pikes that they replaced.{{dubious|date=March 2012}} Because they were also used as pikes, military flintlocks tended to be approximately {{convert|5|-|6|ft|cm}} in length (without the bayonet attached), and used bayonets that were approximately {{convert|18|-|22|inch|cm}} in length.\n\n===Rifles===\nIn Germany the [[German_military_rifles#Early J\u00e4ger rifles|j\u00e4ger rifle]] was developed by the late 18th century. It was used for hunting, and in a military context, skirmishing and by specialist marksmen. \n\n[[Image:Drevnosti RG v3 ill111 - Rifle of Alexei Mikhailovich.jpg|thumb|Russian flintlock rifle made in 1654 by master Grigory Viatkin.]]\nIn the United States, the small game hunting [[long rifle]] (\"Pennsylvania rifle\" or \"Kentucky rifle\") was developed in southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1700s. Based on J\u00e4ger rifle, but with a much longer barrel, these were exceptionally accurate for their time, and had an effective range of approximately 250 meters.<ref>\"What about the rifle?\", Popular Science, September 1941</ref> They tended to fire smaller caliber rounds, with calibers in the range of .32 to .45 being common - hence being sometimes referred to as a \"pea rifle\".<ref>\"American Rifle: A Treatise, a Text Book, and a Book of Practical Information in the Use of the Rifle\" By Townsend Whelen, Publisher: Paladin Press (July 2006)</ref>\n\nThe [[jezail]] was a military long flintlock rifle, developed and popular throughout [[Afghanistan]], India, [[Central Asia]] and parts of the [[Middle East]].\n\nHowever, while European military tactics remained based on loosely-aimed mass volleys, most of their flintlocks were still smoothbore - as the spiral grooves of rifling made rifles take more time to load, and after repeated shots [[black powder]] tended to foul the barrels. \n\nRifled flintlocks saw most military use by sharpshooters, skirmishers, and other support units. While by the late 18th century there were increasing efforts to take advantage of the rifle for military purposes, with specialist rifle units such as the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] of 1756 and [[Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]], smoothbores predominated until the advent of the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] \u2013 by which time the [[percussion cap]] had made the flintlock obsolete.\n\n===Multishot flintlock weapons===\n\n====Multiple barrels====\nBecause of the time needed to reload (even experts needed 15 seconds to reload a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading musket<ref>Dennis E. Showalter, William J. Astore, ''Soldiers' lives through history: Volume 3: The early modern world'', p.65, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 {{ISBN|0-313-33312-2}}.</ref>), flintlocks were sometimes produced with two, three, four or more barrels for multiple shots. These designs tended to be costly to make and were often unreliable and dangerous. While weapons like double barreled shotguns were reasonably safe, weapons like the [[pepperbox|pepperbox revolver]] would sometimes fire all barrels simultaneously, or would sometimes just explode in the user's hand. It was often less expensive, safer, and more reliable to carry several single-shot weapons instead.\n\n====Single barrel====\nSome repeater rifles, multishot single barrel pistols, and multishot single barrel revolvers were also made. Notable are the [[Puckle gun]], [[Mortimer]],<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4833569 Mortimer multishot pistol]</ref> Kalthoff, Michele Lorenzoni, [[Abraham Hill]], Cookson pistols,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA37 Flintlock revolvers]</ref> the Jennings repeater and the [[Elisha Collier revolver]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Drawbacks==\n\nFlintlocks were prone to many problems compared to modern weapons. Misfires were common. The flint had to be properly maintained, as a dull or poorly napped piece of flint would not make as much of a spark and would increase the misfire rate dramatically. Moisture was a problem, since moisture on the frizzen or damp powder would prevent the weapon from firing. This meant that flintlock weapons could not be used in rainy or damp weather. Some armies attempted to remedy this by using a leather cover over the lock mechanism, but this proved to have only limited success.<ref>\"Elements of military art and history\" By Edouard La Barre Duparcq, Nicolas \u00c9douard Delabarre-Duparcq, 1863</ref>\n\nAccidental firing was also a problem for flintlocks. A burning ember left in the barrel could ignite the next powder charge as it was loaded. This could be avoided by waiting between shots for any leftover residue to completely burn. Running a lubricated cleaning patch down the barrel with the ramrod would also extinguish any embers, and would clean out some of the barrel fouling as well. Soldiers on the battlefield could not take these precautions though. They had to fire as quickly as possible, often firing three to four rounds per minute. Loading and firing at such a pace dramatically increased the risk of an accidental discharge.\n\nWhen a flintlock was fired it sprayed a shower of sparks forwards from the muzzle and another sideways out of the flash-hole. One reason for firing in volleys was to ensure that one man's sparks didn't ignite the next man's powder as he was in the act of loading.\n\nAn accidental frizzen strike could also ignite the main powder charge, even if the pan had not yet been primed. Some modern flintlock users will still place a leather cover over the frizzen while loading as a safety measure to prevent this from happening. However, this does slow down the loading time, which prevented safety practices such as this from being used on the battlefields of the past.\n\nThe black powder used in flintlocks would quickly foul the barrel, which was a problem for rifles and for smooth bore weapons that fired a tighter fitting round for greater accuracy. Each shot would add more fouling to the barrel, making the weapon more and more difficult to load. Even if the barrel was badly fouled, the flintlock user still had to properly seat the round all the way to the breech of the barrel. Leaving an air gap in between the powder and the round (known as \"short starting\") was very dangerous, and could cause the barrel to explode.\n\nHandling loose black powder was also dangerous, for obvious reasons. Powder measures, funnels, and other pieces of equipment were usually made out of brass to reduce the risk of creating a spark, which could ignite the powder. Soldiers often used pre-made \"cartridges\", which unlike modern cartridges were not inserted whole into the weapon. Instead, they were tubes of paper that contained a pre-measured amount of powder and a lead ball. Although paper cartridges were safer to handle than loose powder, their primary purpose was not safety related at all. Instead, paper cartridges were used mainly because they sped up the loading process. A soldier did not have to take the time to measure out powder when using a paper cartridge. He simply tore open the cartridge, used a small amount of powder to prime the pan, then dumped the remaining powder from the cartridge into the barrel.\n\nThe black powder used in flintlocks contained sulfur. If the weapon was not cleaned after use, the powder residue would absorb moisture from the air and would combine it with the sulfur to produce sulfuric acid. This acid would erode the inside of the gun barrel and the lock mechanism. Flintlock weapons that were not properly cleaned and maintained would corrode to the point of being destroyed.\n\nMost flintlocks were produced at a time before modern manufacturing processes became common. Even in mass-produced weapons, parts were often handmade. If a flintlock became damaged, or parts wore out due to age, the damaged parts were not easily replaced. Parts would often have to be filed down, hammered into shape, or otherwise modified so that they would fit, making repairs much more difficult. Machine-made, [[interchangeable parts]]  began to be used only shortly before flintlocks were replaced by caplocks.\n\n[[Image:Skalka muszkietu 1.jpg|thumb|The flint for flintlock \u2013 17th century]]\n\n==Method of operation==\n{{details|Flintlock mechanism}}\n[[File:Flintlock ignition animation.gif|thumb|right|Flintlock firing]]\n[[File:Flintlock ignition movie.gif|thumb|right|Sparks generated by a flintlock mechanism]]\n\n* A cock tightly holding a sharp piece of [[flint]] is rotated to [[half-cock]], where the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] falls into a [[Safety (firearms)|safety notch]] on the tumbler, preventing an accidental discharge.\n* The operator loads the gun, usually from the muzzle end, with [[black powder]] from a [[powder flask]], followed by [[lead shot]], a round lead ball, usually wrapped in a piece of paper or a cloth patch, all rammed down with a [[ramrod]] that is usually stored on the underside of the barrel. Wadding between the charge and the ball was often used in earlier guns.\n* The flash pan is primed with a small amount of very finely ground gunpowder, and the flashpan lid or frizzen is closed.\n\nThe gun is now in a \"primed and loaded\" state, and this is how it would typically be carried while [[hunting]] or if going into battle.\n\nTo fire:\n\n* The cock is further rotated from [[half-cock]] to full-cock, releasing the [[Safety (firearms)|safety lock]] on the cock.\n* The gun is leveled and the trigger is pulled, releasing the cock holding the flint.\n* The flint strikes the [[frizzen]], a piece of steel on the priming pan lid, opening it and exposing the priming powder.\n* The contact between flint and frizzen produces a shower of sparks (burning pieces of the metal) that is directed into the gunpowder in the flashpan.\n* The powder ignites, and the flash passes through a small hole in the barrel (called a vent or [[touchhole]]) that leads to the combustion chamber where it ignites the main powder charge, and the gun discharges.\n\nThe British Army and the Continental Army, both used [[paper cartridge]]s to load their weapons.<ref>Day of Concord and Lexington (French, 1925) p. 25 note 1. See also pp. 27-36.</ref> The powder charge and ball were instantly available to the soldier inside this small paper envelope. To load a flintlock weapon using a paper cartridge, a soldier would\n\n* move the cock to the half-cock position;\n* tear the cartridge open with his teeth;\n* fill the flashpan half-full with powder, directing it toward the vent;\n* close the frizzen to keep the priming charge in the pan;\n* pour the rest of the powder down the muzzle and stuff the cartridge in after it;\n* take out the ramrod and ram the ball and cartridge all the way to the breech;\n* replace the ramrod;\n* shoulder the weapon.\n\nThe weapon can then be fully cocked and fired.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nFirearms using some form of flintlock mechanism were the main form of firearm for over 200 years. It was not until [[Alexander John Forsyth|Reverend Alexander John Forsyth]]  invented a rudimentary [[percussion cap]] system in 1807 that the flintlock system began to decline in popularity. The percussion ignition system was more weatherproof and reliable than the flintlock, but the transition from flintlock to percussion cap was a slow one, and the percussion system was not widely used until around 1830. The [[Springfield Model 1840 Flintlock Musket|Model 1840 U.S. musket]] was the last flintlock firearm produced for the U.S. military.<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref> However, obsolete flintlocks saw action in the earliest days of the [[American Civil War]]. For example, in 1861, the Army of Tennessee had over 2,000 flintlock muskets in service.\n\nAs a result of the flintlock's long active life, it left lasting marks on the language and on drill and [[parade]]. Terms such as: \"[[Wiktionary:lock, stock and barrel|lock, stock and barrel]]\", \"[[Wiktionary:go off half-cocked|going off half-cocked]]\" and \"[[Wiktionary:flash in the pan|flash in the pan]]\" remain current in English. In addition, the weapon positions and [[drill commands]] that were originally devised to standardize carrying, loading and firing a flintlock weapon remain the standard for drill and display (see [[manual of arms]]).\n\n<gallery>\nImage:FlintlockFiring.jpg|A flintlock [[musket]] being fired\nImage:Musket.jpg|Reproduction flintlock musket detail\nImage:Flintlock5892.jpg|Flintlock firearm ignition sequence\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Matchlock]]\n*[[Wheellock]]\n*[[Caplock]]\n*[[Snaplock]]\n*[[Snaphance]]\n*[[Miquelet]]\n*[[Doglock]]\n*[[Blunderbuss]]\n*[[Queen Anne pistol]]\n*[[Boyer Rifle]]\n*[[Hand cannon]]\n*[[Dane gun]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Flayderman's Guide to Antique Firearms and Their Values'' 7th Edition, by Norm Flayderman 1998 Krause Publications {{ISBN|0-87349-313-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87349-313-0}}\n* Blackmore, Howard L., Guns and Rifles of the World.

The term may also apply to a particular form of the mechanism itself, also known as the ''[[flintlock mechanism|true flintlock]]'', that was introduced in the early 17th [[century]], and rapidly replaced earlier firearm-ignition technologies, such as the [[matchlock]], the [[wheellock]], and the earlier flintlock mechanisms.\n\nThe true flintlock continued to be in common use for over two centuries, replaced by [[percussion cap]] and, later, the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge-based]] systems in the early-to-mid 19th century. Although long superseded by modern firearms, flintlock weapons enjoy continuing popularity with [[Black powder|black-powder]] shooting enthusiasts.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Thomas Gainsborough - Mr and Mrs Andrews.jpg|thumb|An English gentleman circa 1750 with his flintlock muzzle-loading sporting rifle, in a painting by [[Thomas Gainsborough]].]]\n\nFrench court gunsmith [[Marin le Bourgeoys]] made a [[firearm]] incorporating a flintlock mechanism for King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] shortly after his accession to the throne in 1610.<ref>\"Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\" by [[Jeff Kinard]]. Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004</ref> However, firearms using some form of flint ignition mechanism had already been in use for over half a century. The development of firearm lock mechanisms had proceeded from the [[matchlock]] to [[wheellock]] to the earlier flintlocks ([[snaplock]], [[snaphance]],  [[miquelet]], and [[doglock]]) in the previous two centuries, and each type had been an improvement, contributing design features to later firearms which were useful. Le Bourgeoys fitted these various features together to create what became known as ''the'' flintlock or ''true'' flintlock.\n\nThe new flintlock system quickly became popular, and was known and used in various forms throughout Europe by 1630, although older flintlock systems continued to be used for some time. Examples of early flintlock muskets can be seen in the painting \"Marie de' Medici as Bellona\" by [[Rubens]] (painted around 1622-25).\n\nVarious breech-loading flintlocks were developed starting around 1650. The most popular action has a barrel which was unscrewed from the rest of the gun. Obviously this is more practical on pistols because of the shorter barrel length. This type is known as a [[Queen Anne pistol]] because it was during [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|her reign]] that it became popular (although it was actually introduced in the reign of King [[William III of England|William III]]). Another type has a removable screw plug set into the side or top or bottom of the barrel. A large number of sporting rifles were made with this system, as it allowed easier loading compared with muzzle loading with a tight fitting bullet and patch.\n\nOne of the more successful was the system built by Isaac de la Chaumette starting in 1704. The barrel could be opened by 3 revolutions of the triggerguard, to which it was attached. The plug stayed attached to the barrel and the ball and powder were loaded from the top. This system was improved in the 1770s by Colonel [[Patrick Ferguson]] and 100 experimental rifles used in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The only two flintlock breechloaders to be produced in quantity were the Hall and the Crespi. The first was invented by [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]] and patented c. 1817.<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref> It was issued to the U.S. Army as the [[M1819 Hall rifle|Model 1819 Hall Breech Loading Rifle]].<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref>\n\nThe Hall rifles and carbines were loaded using a combustible [[paper cartridge]] inserted into the upward tilting breechblock. Hall rifles leaked gas from the often poorly fitted action. The same problem affected the muskets produced by Giuseppe Crespi and adopted by the Austrian Army in 1771. Nonetheless, the Crespi System was experimented with by the British during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and percussion Halls guns saw service in the [[American Civil War]].\n\nFlintlock weapons were commonly used until the mid 19th century, when they were replaced by [[percussion lock]] systems. Even though they have long been considered obsolete, flintlock weapons continue to be produced today by manufacturers such as Pedersoli, Euroarms, and Armi Sport. Not only are these weapons used by modern re-enactors, but they are also used for hunting, as many U.S. states have dedicated hunting seasons for black-powder weapons, which includes both flintlock and percussion lock weapons.\n\n==Subtypes==\nFlintlocks may be any type of [[small arm]]: [[long gun]] or [[pistol]], [[smoothbore]] or [[rifle]], [[muzzleloader]] or [[Breechloading|breechloader]].\n\n===Pistols===\n[[File:Pistolet \u00e0 silex Queen Anne IMG 3172.jpg|thumb|Flintlock pistol in \"Queen Anne\" layout, made in Lausanne by Galliard, circa 1760. On display at Morges military museum.]]\nFlintlock pistols were used as self-defense weapons and as a military arm. Their effective range was short, and they were frequently used as an adjunct to a [[sword]] or [[cutlass]]. Pistols were usually smoothbore although some rifled pistols were produced.\n\nFlintlock pistols came in a variety of sizes and styles which often overlap and are not well defined, many of the names we use having been applied by collectors and dealers long after the pistols were obsolete. The smallest were less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} long and the largest were over {{convert|20|in|cm}}. From around the beginning of the 1700s the larger pistols got shorter, so that by the late 1700s the largest would be more like {{convert|16|in|cm}} long. The smallest would fit into a typical pocket or a hand warming muff and could easily be carried by women.\n\nThe largest sizes would be carried in holsters across a horse's back just ahead of the saddle. In-between sizes included the coat pocket pistol, or coat pistol, which would fit into a large pocket, the coach pistol, meant to be carried on or under the seat of a coach in a bag or box, and belt pistols, sometimes equipped with a hook designed to slip over a belt or waistband. Larger pistols were called horse pistols. Arguably the most elegant of the pistol designs was the [[Queen Anne pistol]], which was made in all sizes.\n\nProbably the high point of the mechanical development of the flintlock pistol was the British [[duelling pistol]]; it was highly reliable, water resistant and accurate. External decoration was minimal but craftsmanship was evident, and the internal works were often finished to a higher degree of craftsmanship than the exterior. Dueling pistols were the size of the horse pistols of the late 1700s, around {{convert|16|in|cm}} long and were usually sold in pairs along with accessories in a wooden case with compartments for each piece.\n\n===Muskets===\n{{Main article|Musket}}\n[[Image:Flintlock.jpg|thumb|Flintlock mechanism]]\nFlintlock [[muskets]] were the mainstay of European [[army|armies]] between 1660 and 1840. A musket was a muzzle-loading smoothbore long gun that was loaded with a round lead ball, but it could also be loaded with [[Lead shot|shot]] for [[hunting]]. For military purposes, the weapon was loaded with ball, or a mixture of ball with several large shot (called [[buck and ball]]), and had an effective range of about 75 to 100 metres. Smoothbore weapons that were designed for hunting birds were called \"fowlers.\"  Flintlock muskets tended to be of large caliber and usually had no [[Choke_(firearms)|choke]], allowing them to fire full-caliber balls.\n\nMilitary flintlock muskets tended to weigh approximately ten pounds, as heavier weapons were found to be too cumbersome, and lighter weapons were not rugged or heavy enough to be used in hand-to-hand combat. They were usually designed to be fitted with a bayonet. On flintlocks, the bayonet played a much more significant role, often accounting for a third or more of all battlefield casualties. This is a rather controversial topic in history though, given that casualties list from several battles in the 18th century showed that less than 2% of wounds were caused by bayonets.<ref>Lynn, John A. Giant of the Grand Si\u00e8cle: The French Army, 1610-1715. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1997. Print.</ref>\n\n[[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], a celebrated military author of the [[Napoleon]]ic period who served in numerous armies during that period, stated that the majority of bayonet [[charge (warfare)|charge]]s in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contacts were made.<ref>Jomini, Antoine Henri. The Art of War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1971. Print.\n</ref>  Flintlock weapons were not used like modern rifles. They tended to be fired in mass volleys, followed by bayonet charges in which the weapons were used much like the pikes that they replaced.{{dubious|date=March 2012}} Because they were also used as pikes, military flintlocks tended to be approximately {{convert|5|-|6|ft|cm}} in length (without the bayonet attached), and used bayonets that were approximately {{convert|18|-|22|inch|cm}} in length.\n\n===Rifles===\nIn Germany the [[German_military_rifles#Early J\u00e4ger rifles|j\u00e4ger rifle]] was developed by the late 18th century. It was used for hunting, and in a military context, skirmishing and by specialist marksmen. \n\n[[Image:Drevnosti RG v3 ill111 - Rifle of Alexei Mikhailovich.jpg|thumb|Russian flintlock rifle made in 1654 by master Grigory Viatkin.]]\nIn the United States, the small game hunting [[long rifle]] (\"Pennsylvania rifle\" or \"Kentucky rifle\") was developed in southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1700s. Based on J\u00e4ger rifle, but with a much longer barrel, these were exceptionally accurate for their time, and had an effective range of approximately 250 meters.<ref>\"What about the rifle?\", Popular Science, September 1941</ref> They tended to fire smaller caliber rounds, with calibers in the range of .32 to .45 being common - hence being sometimes referred to as a \"pea rifle\".<ref>\"American Rifle: A Treatise, a Text Book, and a Book of Practical Information in the Use of the Rifle\" By Townsend Whelen, Publisher: Paladin Press (July 2006)</ref>\n\nThe [[jezail]] was a military long flintlock rifle, developed and popular throughout [[Afghanistan]], India, [[Central Asia]] and parts of the [[Middle East]].\n\nHowever, while European military tactics remained based on loosely-aimed mass volleys, most of their flintlocks were still smoothbore - as the spiral grooves of rifling made rifles take more time to load, and after repeated shots [[black powder]] tended to foul the barrels. \n\nRifled flintlocks saw most military use by sharpshooters, skirmishers, and other support units. While by the late 18th century there were increasing efforts to take advantage of the rifle for military purposes, with specialist rifle units such as the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] of 1756 and [[Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]], smoothbores predominated until the advent of the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] \u2013 by which time the [[percussion cap]] had made the flintlock obsolete.\n\n===Multishot flintlock weapons===\n\n====Multiple barrels====\nBecause of the time needed to reload (even experts needed 15 seconds to reload a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading musket<ref>Dennis E. Showalter, William J. Astore, ''Soldiers' lives through history: Volume 3: The early modern world'', p.65, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 {{ISBN|0-313-33312-2}}.</ref>), flintlocks were sometimes produced with two, three, four or more barrels for multiple shots. These designs tended to be costly to make and were often unreliable and dangerous. While weapons like double barreled shotguns were reasonably safe, weapons like the [[pepperbox|pepperbox revolver]] would sometimes fire all barrels simultaneously, or would sometimes just explode in the user's hand. It was often less expensive, safer, and more reliable to carry several single-shot weapons instead.\n\n====Single barrel====\nSome repeater rifles, multishot single barrel pistols, and multishot single barrel revolvers were also made. Notable are the [[Puckle gun]], [[Mortimer]],<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4833569 Mortimer multishot pistol]</ref> Kalthoff, Michele Lorenzoni, [[Abraham Hill]], Cookson pistols,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA37 Flintlock revolvers]</ref> the Jennings repeater and the [[Elisha Collier revolver]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Drawbacks==\n\nFlintlocks were prone to many problems compared to modern weapons. Misfires were common. The flint had to be properly maintained, as a dull or poorly napped piece of flint would not make as much of a spark and would increase the misfire rate dramatically. Moisture was a problem, since moisture on the frizzen or damp powder would prevent the weapon from firing. This meant that flintlock weapons could not be used in rainy or damp weather. Some armies attempted to remedy this by using a leather cover over the lock mechanism, but this proved to have only limited success.<ref>\"Elements of military art and history\" By Edouard La Barre Duparcq, Nicolas \u00c9douard Delabarre-Duparcq, 1863</ref>\n\nAccidental firing was also a problem for flintlocks. A burning ember left in the barrel could ignite the next powder charge as it was loaded. This could be avoided by waiting between shots for any leftover residue to completely burn. Running a lubricated cleaning patch down the barrel with the ramrod would also extinguish any embers, and would clean out some of the barrel fouling as well. Soldiers on the battlefield could not take these precautions though. They had to fire as quickly as possible, often firing three to four rounds per minute. Loading and firing at such a pace dramatically increased the risk of an accidental discharge.\n\nWhen a flintlock was fired it sprayed a shower of sparks forwards from the muzzle and another sideways out of the flash-hole. One reason for firing in volleys was to ensure that one man's sparks didn't ignite the next man's powder as he was in the act of loading.\n\nAn accidental frizzen strike could also ignite the main powder charge, even if the pan had not yet been primed. Some modern flintlock users will still place a leather cover over the frizzen while loading as a safety measure to prevent this from happening. However, this does slow down the loading time, which prevented safety practices such as this from being used on the battlefields of the past.\n\nThe black powder used in flintlocks would quickly foul the barrel, which was a problem for rifles and for smooth bore weapons that fired a tighter fitting round for greater accuracy. Each shot would add more fouling to the barrel, making the weapon more and more difficult to load. Even if the barrel was badly fouled, the flintlock user still had to properly seat the round all the way to the breech of the barrel. Leaving an air gap in between the powder and the round (known as \"short starting\") was very dangerous, and could cause the barrel to explode.\n\nHandling loose black powder was also dangerous, for obvious reasons. Powder measures, funnels, and other pieces of equipment were usually made out of brass to reduce the risk of creating a spark, which could ignite the powder. Soldiers often used pre-made \"cartridges\", which unlike modern cartridges were not inserted whole into the weapon. Instead, they were tubes of paper that contained a pre-measured amount of powder and a lead ball. Although paper cartridges were safer to handle than loose powder, their primary purpose was not safety related at all. Instead, paper cartridges were used mainly because they sped up the loading process. A soldier did not have to take the time to measure out powder when using a paper cartridge. He simply tore open the cartridge, used a small amount of powder to prime the pan, then dumped the remaining powder from the cartridge into the barrel.\n\nThe black powder used in flintlocks contained sulfur. If the weapon was not cleaned after use, the powder residue would absorb moisture from the air and would combine it with the sulfur to produce sulfuric acid. This acid would erode the inside of the gun barrel and the lock mechanism. Flintlock weapons that were not properly cleaned and maintained would corrode to the point of being destroyed.\n\nMost flintlocks were produced at a time before modern manufacturing processes became common. Even in mass-produced weapons, parts were often handmade. If a flintlock became damaged, or parts wore out due to age, the damaged parts were not easily replaced. Parts would often have to be filed down, hammered into shape, or otherwise modified so that they would fit, making repairs much more difficult. Machine-made, [[interchangeable parts]]  began to be used only shortly before flintlocks were replaced by caplocks.\n\n[[Image:Skalka muszkietu 1.jpg|thumb|The flint for flintlock \u2013 17th century]]\n\n==Method of operation==\n{{details|Flintlock mechanism}}\n[[File:Flintlock ignition animation.gif|thumb|right|Flintlock firing]]\n[[File:Flintlock ignition movie.gif|thumb|right|Sparks generated by a flintlock mechanism]]\n\n* A cock tightly holding a sharp piece of [[flint]] is rotated to [[half-cock]], where the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] falls into a [[Safety (firearms)|safety notch]] on the tumbler, preventing an accidental discharge.\n* The operator loads the gun, usually from the muzzle end, with [[black powder]] from a [[powder flask]], followed by [[lead shot]], a round lead ball, usually wrapped in a piece of paper or a cloth patch, all rammed down with a [[ramrod]] that is usually stored on the underside of the barrel. Wadding between the charge and the ball was often used in earlier guns.\n* The flash pan is primed with a small amount of very finely ground gunpowder, and the flashpan lid or frizzen is closed.\n\nThe gun is now in a \"primed and loaded\" state, and this is how it would typically be carried while [[hunting]] or if going into battle.\n\nTo fire:\n\n* The cock is further rotated from [[half-cock]] to full-cock, releasing the [[Safety (firearms)|safety lock]] on the cock.\n* The gun is leveled and the trigger is pulled, releasing the cock holding the flint.\n* The flint strikes the [[frizzen]], a piece of steel on the priming pan lid, opening it and exposing the priming powder.\n* The contact between flint and frizzen produces a shower of sparks (burning pieces of the metal) that is directed into the gunpowder in the flashpan.\n* The powder ignites, and the flash passes through a small hole in the barrel (called a vent or [[touchhole]]) that leads to the combustion chamber where it ignites the main powder charge, and the gun discharges.\n\nThe British Army and the Continental Army, both used [[paper cartridge]]s to load their weapons.<ref>Day of Concord and Lexington (French, 1925) p. 25 note 1. See also pp. 27-36.</ref> The powder charge and ball were instantly available to the soldier inside this small paper envelope. To load a flintlock weapon using a paper cartridge, a soldier would\n\n* move the cock to the half-cock position;\n* tear the cartridge open with his teeth;\n* fill the flashpan half-full with powder, directing it toward the vent;\n* close the frizzen to keep the priming charge in the pan;\n* pour the rest of the powder down the muzzle and stuff the cartridge in after it;\n* take out the ramrod and ram the ball and cartridge all the way to the breech;\n* replace the ramrod;\n* shoulder the weapon.\n\nThe weapon can then be fully cocked and fired.\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nFirearms using some form of flintlock mechanism were the main form of firearm for over 200 years. It was not until [[Alexander John Forsyth|Reverend Alexander John Forsyth]]  invented a rudimentary [[percussion cap]] system in 1807 that the flintlock system began to decline in popularity. The percussion ignition system was more weatherproof and reliable than the flintlock, but the transition from flintlock to percussion cap was a slow one, and the percussion system was not widely used until around 1830. The [[Springfield Model 1840 Flintlock Musket|Model 1840 U.S. musket]] was the last flintlock firearm produced for the U.S. military.<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref> However, obsolete flintlocks saw action in the earliest days of the [[American Civil War]]. For example, in 1861, the Army of Tennessee had over 2,000 flintlock muskets in service.\n\nAs a result of the flintlock's long active life, it left lasting marks on the language and on drill and [[parade]]. Terms such as: \"[[Wiktionary:lock, stock and barrel|lock, stock and barrel]]\", \"[[Wiktionary:go off half-cocked|going off half-cocked]]\" and \"[[Wiktionary:flash in the pan|flash in the pan]]\" remain current in English. In addition, the weapon positions and [[drill commands]] that were originally devised to standardize carrying, loading and firing a flintlock weapon remain the standard for drill and display (see [[manual of arms]]).\n\n<gallery>\nImage:FlintlockFiring.jpg|A flintlock [[musket]] being fired\nImage:Musket.jpg|Reproduction flintlock musket detail\nImage:Flintlock5892.jpg|Flintlock firearm ignition sequence\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Matchlock]]\n*[[Wheellock]]\n*[[Caplock]]\n*[[Snaplock]]\n*[[Snaphance]]\n*[[Miquelet]]\n*[[Doglock]]\n*[[Blunderbuss]]\n*[[Queen Anne pistol]]\n*[[Boyer Rifle]]\n*[[Hand cannon]]\n*[[Dane gun]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Flayderman's Guide to Antique Firearms and Their Values'' 7th Edition, by Norm Flayderman 1998 Krause Publications {{ISBN|0-87349-313-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87349-313-0}}\n* Blackmore, Howard L., Guns and Rifles of the World.

Tabarca is largest island in the [[Valencian Community]] and the smallest permanently inhabited islet in Spain. It is known for its [[marine reserve]].\n\n==Geography==\nDespite being much more socially and economically related to the fishing port of Santa Pola, the tiny island of Tabarca is a part of the city of [[Alicante]]. Administratively, it is managed as a rural district of Alicante, jointly with el Palmeral, Aiguamarga and Urbanova.\n\nThe local census (2011) counted 68 inhabitants and its postal code is 03138.\n\nThe islet is {{convert|1750|m|0|abbr=on}} long, with a maximum breadth of {{convert|300|m|0|abbr=on}} and absolutely flat.

There are several boats connecting Tabarca with [[Alicante]], [[Santa Pola]] and [[Torrevieja]], with higher frequencies during summer time.\n\n== History==\nBefore 1700, the island was known as ''Illa de Sant Pau'' ('Saint Paul's Island') or ''Illa Plana'' ('Flat Island'). Believed to be the island that [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] disembarked on, the island was a refuge for [[Barbary pirates]] up to the end of the 18th century.\n\nIts Tunisian fellow islet off the town of [[Tabarka]]  was a part of the [[Republic of Genoa]] till 1741 when it was conquered by the [[Bey]] of Tunis.  In 1760, [[Charles III of Spain]] ordered the fortification and repopulation of the Spanish island. A group of Genoese sailors shipwrecked near the coast of Tunisia, mostly coming from the islet off Tunisian Tabarka, were rescued and settled here. The islet was renamed Nova Tabarca (\"New Tabarca\" in both Valencian and Latin). Thus a settlement was created by royal edict on this uninhabited island which the North African corsaries had previously used as a platform for raids on the [[Levante, Spain|Levantine]] coast.\n[[File:Tabarca. Pl\u00e0nol de la ciutat.png|thumb|300px|Plan of the city.]]\nOn their arrival, the Genoese were first moved to [[Alicante]], where they lived temporarily in the Jesuit School, empty after the  [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus#Spanish Empire and Naples|expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain]]. Finally, the Genoese were moved to the island together with a Spanish garrison. The military engineer Fernando M\u00e9ndez Ras planned a fortified town and walls, bulwarks, warehouses and barracks were built. From 1770, the island was known as Nueva Tabarca ('New Tabarca').\n\nAlthough the Genoese assimilated,  abandoning [[Genoese language|their language]] in favour first of [[Valencian]] and, later on, of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (both languages are currently spoken on the islet), the Genoese descent of the settlers can still be noticed today in the surnames of Italian origin common on the islet.\n\nThe island is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with [[Carloforte]], in the [[Sardinia]]n [[San Pietro Island]], which was also populated with Genoese from Tunisian Tabarka.\n\nThe gateways are still visible and so are the Governor's House (currently a hotel) and the church of St Peter and St Paul, concluded in 1779.\n\nIn 1850 the governor and the garrison were removed. At the end of the 19th century, the island had a population of around 1,000 people mainly devoted to fishing. Nowadays, the permanent population is around 50, making Tabarca the smallest permanently inhabited Spanish island, although this number is multiplied by ten during the tourist season in summer.\n\nThe main activity of the local population is fishing, with the catch brought to Santa Pola's fish market, but tourism becomes the most important resource during summer, specially in July and August.\n\n== Ecology==\n[[File:Playa Tabarca.jpg|thumb|A view of Tabarca beach.]]\nTabarca is a protected marine reserve called ''Reserva marina de la Isla de Tabarca'', declared a Zone of Special Protection for Birds by the EU, with a varied marine fauna (sea bass, grouper, conger eel, gilthead etc.). It is surrounded by very clear and unpolluted waters. The island is formed by materials of volcanic origin on top of which limestone and quaternary deposits have settled.\n\nTabarca was the last Spanish Mediterranean location where the critically endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]] successfully bred before it became extinct in this part of its range in the 1960s. This proves the high quality of the waters around the island in terms of marine ecology. Therefore, waters around Tabarca were declared a [[Marine reserve]] in 1986, the first of its kind in Spain. This status was mainly granted due to its submarine [[posidonia]] prairie, which is the largest in the Spanish Mediterranean and has an extraordinary ecological value in terms of marine fauna and flora.\n\nIn order to both enhance the marine biodiversity and protect it from fishing, an [[artificial reef]] was laid near the island by the Marine Reserve authorities.\n\n==See also==\n* Genoese-Tabarka diaspora\n** [[Tabarka]]\n** [[Calasetta]]\n** [[San Pietro Island]]\n** [[Carloforte]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikivoyage|Tabarca}}\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.164255,-0.475159&spn=0.063725,0.120352&t=k&hl=en Tabarca en Google Maps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061103114215/http://www.mapa.es/rmarinas/index_rm.htm Official site of the Spanish Marine Reservations, including Tabarca (in Spanish)].\n* [http://www.alicante-spain.com/tabarca-island.html Tabarca] insights, including details about the local food.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050613003553/http://www.alicante-ayto.es/medioambiente/rmtabarca.html Detailed site from the Alicante city council about Tabarca (in Spanish)].\n\n[[Category:Province of Alicante]]\n[[Category:Islands of Spain|Tabarca, island of]]\n[[Category:Marine reserves]]\n[[Category:Utopian communities]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1760]]\n[[Category:Landforms of the Valencian Community]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=June 2013}}\n{{distinguish|text=the Tunisian coastal town of [[Tabarka]]}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name          = Tabarca\n|native_name            = \n|image_skyline          = File:Localitzaci\u00f3 de Santa Pola respecte el Baix Vinalop\u00f3.png\n|imagesize              =\n|image_caption          = In this map of Santa Pola (dark red), Tabarca is on the right and Alicante on the right upper corner\n|pushpin_map            = Spain Province of Alicante#Spain Valencia#Spain\n|pushpin_mapsize        = 250\n|subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = {{ESP}}\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Autonomous Community]]\n|subdivision_name1      = {{nowrap|{{flag|Valencian Community}}}}\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Provinces of Spain|Province]]\n|subdivision_name2      = [[Province of Alicante]]\n|subdivision_type3      = [[Comarca]]\n|subdivision_name3      = [[Alacant\u00ed]]\n|settlement_type        = \n|government_type        =\n|leader_title           = \n|leader_name            = \n|established_title      =  <!-- Settled -->\n|established_date       =\n|established_title2     =  <!-- Incorporated (town) -->\n|established_date2      =\n|established_title3     =  <!-- Incorporated (city) -->\n|established_date3      =\n|area_magnitude         =\n|unit_pref              = Metric <!--Enter: Imperial, if Imperial (metric) is desired-->\n|area_footnotes         =\n|area_total_km2             =\n|area_land_km2              =\n|area_water_km2             =\n|area_total_sq_mi        =\n|area_land_sq_mi         =\n|area_water_sq_mi        =\n|area_water_percent     =\n|area_urban_km2             =\n|area_urban_sq_mi        =\n|area_metro_km2             =\n|area_metro_sq_mi        =\n|population_as_of       = \n|population_note        =\n|population_total       = \n|population_footnotes   = \n|timezone = \n|utc_offset = \n|timezone_DST = \n|utc_offset_DST = \n|coordinates            = {{coord|38|09|59|N|0|28|56|W|region:ES|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    =  <!--for references: use <ref> </ref> tags-->\n|elevation_m              = \n|postal_code_type       =  <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              = \n|website                =\n|footnotes              =\n}}\n'''Tabarca''' ({{IPA-va|ta\u02c8ba\u027eka|lang}}, {{IPA-es|ta\u02c8\u03b2a\u027eka|lang}}) also known in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] as ''Nova Tabarca'' and ''Illa Plana'', and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as ''Nueva Tabarca'' and ''Isla Plana'', is an [[islet]] located in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], close to the town of [[Santa Pola]], in the [[province of Alicante]], [[Valencian community]], [[Spain]].

This status was mainly granted due to its submarine [[posidonia]] prairie, which is the largest in the Spanish Mediterranean and has an extraordinary ecological value in terms of marine fauna and flora.\n\nIn order to both enhance the marine biodiversity and protect it from fishing, an [[artificial reef]] was laid near the island by the Marine Reserve authorities.\n\n==See also==\n* Genoese-Tabarka diaspora\n** [[Tabarka]]\n** [[Calasetta]]\n** [[San Pietro Island]]\n** [[Carloforte]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikivoyage|Tabarca}}\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.164255,-0.475159&spn=0.063725,0.120352&t=k&hl=en Tabarca en Google Maps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061103114215/http://www.mapa.es/rmarinas/index_rm.htm Official site of the Spanish Marine Reservations, including Tabarca (in Spanish)].\n* [http://www.alicante-spain.com/tabarca-island.html Tabarca] insights, including details about the local food.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050613003553/http://www.alicante-ayto.es/medioambiente/rmtabarca.html Detailed site from the Alicante city council about Tabarca (in Spanish)].\n\n[[Category:Province of Alicante]]\n[[Category:Islands of Spain|Tabarca, island of]]\n[[Category:Marine reserves]]\n[[Category:Utopian communities]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1760]]\n[[Category:Landforms of the Valencian Community]]\n", "name_user": "T\u00faria", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabarca"}

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.
