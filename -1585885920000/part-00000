It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a variety of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands. It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s, such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light, shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry, open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], and between a line from [[Charters Towers]] south to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

It is one of two [[Talk radio]] stations in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] owned by [[Cumulus Media]].  The other is 560 [[KSFO]]. While KSFO airs mostly [[Radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] talk hosts, KGO runs mostly local hosts on weekdays. KGO operates with 50,000 [[watt]]s, the highest power permitted AM radio stations by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].  But it uses a [[directional antenna]] to protect the other [[List of North American broadcast station classes|Class A]] station on 810&nbsp;kHz, [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]].\n\nMost nights, using a good radio, KGO can be heard throughout the [[Western United States]] east to the [[Rocky Mountains]], and in Northern [[Mexico]], Western [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]]. KGO operated as the West Coast [[Flagship (radio)|flagship radio station]] of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) until the radio group was purchased by [[Citadel Broadcasting]] in 2007.

KGO was first known as the \"Sunset Station\"; at that time it operated with a then-impressive 1000 watts.<ref>\"Open Station KGO at Oakland.\"  Decatur IL Review, February 9, 1924, p.&nbsp;23; also, \"New KGO Will Open Tomorrow.\"  Oakland Tribune, January 8, 1924, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> As was the custom with early radio stations, the programming consisted of performances by local talent, including the KGO [[Orchestra]] which provided some of the music; and a dramatic group known as the KGO Players, which performed weekly plays and short skits, often under the direction of Bay-area drama instructor Wilda Wilson Church. The station's music, which was also performed by other local orchestras and vocalists, would include [[Classical music|classical]] selections as well as popular dance music the next night.  Due to GE's involvement in [[RCA]] and RCA's launch of the [[NBC]] radio network, KGO was soon operated by NBC management out of studio facilities in San Francisco as part of the NBC network. See the [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] entry for a fuller discussion of NBC's San Francisco radio operations.\n\nIn order to obtain a [[clear-channel|clear channel]] in Schenectady, New York, for what would become the present-day WGY, GE effected a breakdown of 790&nbsp;kHz{{when|date=June 2017}}. WGY would assume the maximum permissible power, and KGO would be lowered in power to 7.5&nbsp;kW. That was then lower than the minimum permissible power for a clear channel station (10&nbsp;kW){{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, and also was then higher than the then maximum permissible power for a regional channel station (5&nbsp;kW). Both stations retained omnidirectional antennas. Therefore, GE effectively removed from the West one of its eight clear channels and added another clear channel to the East, thereby giving the East nine cleared channels and the West only seven. The other \"regions\" in the Band Plan all retained their allotted eight cleared channels.\n\nIn 1941, stations on 790, including WGY and KGO, were moved to 810 to comply with the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] also known as NARBA. \nOn December 1, 1947, KGO was directionalized and its power was increased to 50&nbsp;kW, the new minimum (and maximum) power for a U.S. [[clear-channel|clear channel]]. An article in [[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]] magazine noted that the increase \"retired the nation's oldest regularly operating transmitter-a 7,500-watter ... in use since Jan. 8, 1924.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=KGO Increases Power to 50 kw Today With Governor Warren Giving Signal|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-12-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=25 October 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=December 1, 1947}}</ref>\n\n===1940s\u20131950s===\nWhen the [[Federal Communications Commission]] forced NBC to sell one of its two networks (and that network's owned-and-operated stations), KGO's license switched from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc., effective January 23, 1942.<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC Okays Transfer of WJZ, KGO, WENR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=30 October 2014|agency=Billboard|date=January 31, 1942}}</ref> The [[NBC Blue Network]] simply dropped \"NBC\" from its name to become the \"Blue Network,\" then in June 1945 re-branded itself the [[American Broadcasting Company]]. KGO would become a founding station of the nascent [[ABC Radio Network]] as a result.\n\nIn the postwar period, KGO produced many live music programs, including that of [[Western Swing]] bandleader [[Bob Wills]], whose music was a staple of the time period. KGO was instrumental in bringing the first exercise show to broadcasting, hosted by [[Jack LaLanne]], a fitness instructor and gym operator in nearby Oakland. LaLanne conducted his radio fitness show for many years on KGO, moving in the late 1950s to [[KGO-TV]] and a successful TV syndication career.\n\nBy the late 1950s, KGO had suffered poor ratings. In 1962, ABC management brought in new management including program director [[Jim Dunbar]], who revamped the station into one of the country's first news/talk stations. While the new format was initially unsuccessful, Dunbar stressed the \"live and local\" aspect of the programming by running the talk shows every day from locations such as [[Johnny Kan]]'s Chinese restaurant, Se\u00f1or Pico's Restaurant, and the legendary [[hungry i]] nightclub. This higher profile caused KGO's ratings to begin a steady climb. Among KGO's personalities during this period was future [[Radio Hall of Fame]] member [[J.P. McCarthy]], the station's morning host in the early 1960s.\n\n===1960s\u20131980s===\nAfter trying various formats, KGO eventually shifted to news and talk programming, relying heavily on the ABC radio network for its news programs. KGO started carrying [[Paul Harvey]]'s twice-daily programs but also began to develop a strong local news staff that produced extended morning and afternoon newscasts. The local talk show hosts included [[Les Crane]], Owen Spann and [[Jim Eason]], who often interviewed visiting celebrities in the KGO studios. Owen Spann also originated special broadcasts from Europe and Africa, interviewing government officials from those countries. Local director-actor Jack Brooks hosted a Saturday-morning entertainment program until his sudden death in June 1984, after directing a production of ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'' for the Capuchino Community Theatre that featured Jim Eason as the poet [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]. Dr. [[Dean Edell]] began his regular medical programs at KGO,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} leading to nationally syndicated broadcasts.\n\n===Ratings and signal strength===\n[[file:KGO 810 logo 2000-2011.png|thumb|right|KGO logo from 2000 to 2011.]]\nFor more than 27 years (as rated quarterly by [[Arbitron]]), KGO was the number-one station in the Bay Area. According to the 2010 Arbitron ratings, however, KGO had lost its lead to KCBS, with [[KOIT-FM]] as a close second, and KGO listing at third.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} When KGO switched to all-news in December 2011, it fell further behind in the local ratings. As of Spring 2013, KGO placed 16th in the market, with approximately half of their listenership when they were number one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/bottomline/article/KGO-Radio-reshuffles-as-ratings-decline-4356439.php|title=KGO Radio reshuffles as ratings decline|author=|date=|website=sfgate.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe KGO signal also registers with Arbitron as a station listened to in surrounding metropolitan areas. Due to the nature of its signal and antenna placement, KGO broadcasts on a north-to-south axis, keeping itself from interfering with [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] (Schenectady, New York) during the night-time and overnight hours when the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts. KGO's signal is received essentially free of static at night in locations such as [[Vancouver, Washington]], [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], but is difficult to receive in [[Reno, Nevada]], and other points east of the Sierra Nevada mountains due to its signal directionality. That said, its overall reach is greater than any FM signal in the Bay Area (according to radio-locator.com map referenced below).\n\n===1990s-2010s===\n[[Image:Kgocopter03162006.jpg|252px|thumb|right|KGO Helicopter.]]  \nUntil December 5, 2011, KGO created nearly all of its own local programming, with very limited syndicated content. The majority of its programs were hosted by [[San Francisco Bay Area]] broadcasters{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The daily schedule included many issues-oriented talk shows, with weekday hosts that included [[Gene Burns]], [[Gil Gross]], [[Ronn Owens]], [[John Rothmann]] and lawyer [[Len Tillem]]. The station also carried a variety of specialty programs, particularly on weekends, with [[John Hamilton (broadcaster)|John Hamilton]] discussing travel and leisure, [[Gene Burns]] covering fine food and dining (on a show separate from his weekday program), [[Joanie Greggains]] hosting a health-and-fitness program, and Brent Walters, who teaches \"Comparative Religions\" at [[San Jose State University]], hosting the early Sunday morning show, ''God Talk.'' In 2014, KGO brought in John Batchelor at midnight.

It is one of two [[Talk radio]] stations in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] owned by [[Cumulus Media]].  The other is 560 [[KSFO]]. While KSFO airs mostly [[Radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] talk hosts, KGO runs mostly local hosts on weekdays. KGO operates with 50,000 [[watt]]s, the highest power permitted AM radio stations by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].  But it uses a [[directional antenna]] to protect the other [[List of North American broadcast station classes|Class A]] station on 810&nbsp;kHz, [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]].\n\nMost nights, using a good radio, KGO can be heard throughout the [[Western United States]] east to the [[Rocky Mountains]], and in Northern [[Mexico]], Western [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]]. KGO operated as the West Coast [[Flagship (radio)|flagship radio station]] of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) until the radio group was purchased by [[Citadel Broadcasting]] in 2007. The station became part of Cumulus Media, following its 2011 merger with Citadel.<ref name=abj-citadelcumulus>{{cite news|title=Cumulus now owns Citadel Broadcasting|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/09/16/cumulus-now-owns-citadel-broadcasting.html|accessdate=September 16, 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Business Journal|date=September 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nKGO has its studios in the [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] portion of San Francisco's [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]].  Before Cumulus took over the station, it was based in the same building as its former television partner [[KGO-TV]] at the ABC Broadcast Center.  Its [[transmitter]] site is based in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] near the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]]. Two of KGO's three towers partially collapsed during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] on October 17, 1989. All three were replaced.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bayarearadio.org/schneider/kgotwr.shtml |title=KGO Radio Tower Collapse 1989 |work=The Bay Area Radio Museum |last=Schneider |first=John |accessdate=May 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter several late-night test broadcasts, using the experimental call letters '''6XG''', radio station KGO signed on the air on January 8, 1924, from [[General Electric]]'s [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] [[transformer]] manufacturing plant (the original two-story brick building, constructed specifically for the station on East 14th Street, was demolished sometime in the 1980s<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/04/22/historic-but-toxic-brick-buildings-defy-attempts-to-level-them/|title=Historic but toxic Oakland brick buildings defy attempts to level them|last=Hedin|first=Mark|date=2017-04-22|work=East Bay Times|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}</ref>), as part of a planned three-station network comprising [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], and [[KOA (AM)|KOA]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. KGO was first known as the \"Sunset Station\"; at that time it operated with a then-impressive 1000 watts.<ref>\"Open Station KGO at Oakland.\"  Decatur IL Review, February 9, 1924, p.&nbsp;23; also, \"New KGO Will Open Tomorrow.\"  Oakland Tribune, January 8, 1924, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> As was the custom with early radio stations, the programming consisted of performances by local talent, including the KGO [[Orchestra]] which provided some of the music; and a dramatic group known as the KGO Players, which performed weekly plays and short skits, often under the direction of Bay-area drama instructor Wilda Wilson Church. The station's music, which was also performed by other local orchestras and vocalists, would include [[Classical music|classical]] selections as well as popular dance music the next night.  Due to GE's involvement in [[RCA]] and RCA's launch of the [[NBC]] radio network, KGO was soon operated by NBC management out of studio facilities in San Francisco as part of the NBC network. See the [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] entry for a fuller discussion of NBC's San Francisco radio operations.\n\nIn order to obtain a [[clear-channel|clear channel]] in Schenectady, New York, for what would become the present-day WGY, GE effected a breakdown of 790&nbsp;kHz{{when|date=June 2017}}. WGY would assume the maximum permissible power, and KGO would be lowered in power to 7.5&nbsp;kW. That was then lower than the minimum permissible power for a clear channel station (10&nbsp;kW){{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, and also was then higher than the then maximum permissible power for a regional channel station (5&nbsp;kW). Both stations retained omnidirectional antennas. Therefore, GE effectively removed from the West one of its eight clear channels and added another clear channel to the East, thereby giving the East nine cleared channels and the West only seven. The other \"regions\" in the Band Plan all retained their allotted eight cleared channels.\n\nIn 1941, stations on 790, including WGY and KGO, were moved to 810 to comply with the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] also known as NARBA. \nOn December 1, 1947, KGO was directionalized and its power was increased to 50&nbsp;kW, the new minimum (and maximum) power for a U.S. [[clear-channel|clear channel]]. An article in [[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]] magazine noted that the increase \"retired the nation's oldest regularly operating transmitter-a 7,500-watter ... in use since Jan. 8, 1924.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=KGO Increases Power to 50 kw Today With Governor Warren Giving Signal|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-12-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=25 October 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=December 1, 1947}}</ref>\n\n===1940s\u20131950s===\nWhen the [[Federal Communications Commission]] forced NBC to sell one of its two networks (and that network's owned-and-operated stations), KGO's license switched from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc., effective January 23, 1942.<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC Okays Transfer of WJZ, KGO, WENR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=30 October 2014|agency=Billboard|date=January 31, 1942}}</ref> The [[NBC Blue Network]] simply dropped \"NBC\" from its name to become the \"Blue Network,\" then in June 1945 re-branded itself the [[American Broadcasting Company]]. KGO would become a founding station of the nascent [[ABC Radio Network]] as a result.\n\nIn the postwar period, KGO produced many live music programs, including that of [[Western Swing]] bandleader [[Bob Wills]], whose music was a staple of the time period. KGO was instrumental in bringing the first exercise show to broadcasting, hosted by [[Jack LaLanne]], a fitness instructor and gym operator in nearby Oakland. LaLanne conducted his radio fitness show for many years on KGO, moving in the late 1950s to [[KGO-TV]] and a successful TV syndication career.\n\nBy the late 1950s, KGO had suffered poor ratings. In 1962, ABC management brought in new management including program director [[Jim Dunbar]], who revamped the station into one of the country's first news/talk stations. While the new format was initially unsuccessful, Dunbar stressed the \"live and local\" aspect of the programming by running the talk shows every day from locations such as [[Johnny Kan]]'s Chinese restaurant, Se\u00f1or Pico's Restaurant, and the legendary [[hungry i]] nightclub. This higher profile caused KGO's ratings to begin a steady climb. Among KGO's personalities during this period was future [[Radio Hall of Fame]] member [[J.P. McCarthy]], the station's morning host in the early 1960s.\n\n===1960s\u20131980s===\nAfter trying various formats, KGO eventually shifted to news and talk programming, relying heavily on the ABC radio network for its news programs. KGO started carrying [[Paul Harvey]]'s twice-daily programs but also began to develop a strong local news staff that produced extended morning and afternoon newscasts. The local talk show hosts included [[Les Crane]], Owen Spann and [[Jim Eason]], who often interviewed visiting celebrities in the KGO studios. Owen Spann also originated special broadcasts from Europe and Africa, interviewing government officials from those countries. Local director-actor Jack Brooks hosted a Saturday-morning entertainment program until his sudden death in June 1984, after directing a production of ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'' for the Capuchino Community Theatre that featured Jim Eason as the poet [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]]. Dr. [[Dean Edell]] began his regular medical programs at KGO,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} leading to nationally syndicated broadcasts.\n\n===Ratings and signal strength===\n[[file:KGO 810 logo 2000-2011.png|thumb|right|KGO logo from 2000 to 2011.]]\nFor more than 27 years (as rated quarterly by [[Arbitron]]), KGO was the number-one station in the Bay Area. According to the 2010 Arbitron ratings, however, KGO had lost its lead to KCBS, with [[KOIT-FM]] as a close second, and KGO listing at third.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} When KGO switched to all-news in December 2011, it fell further behind in the local ratings. As of Spring 2013, KGO placed 16th in the market, with approximately half of their listenership when they were number one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/bottomline/article/KGO-Radio-reshuffles-as-ratings-decline-4356439.php|title=KGO Radio reshuffles as ratings decline|author=|date=|website=sfgate.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe KGO signal also registers with Arbitron as a station listened to in surrounding metropolitan areas. Due to the nature of its signal and antenna placement, KGO broadcasts on a north-to-south axis, keeping itself from interfering with [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] (Schenectady, New York) during the night-time and overnight hours when the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts. KGO's signal is received essentially free of static at night in locations such as [[Vancouver, Washington]], [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], but is difficult to receive in [[Reno, Nevada]], and other points east of the Sierra Nevada mountains due to its signal directionality. That said, its overall reach is greater than any FM signal in the Bay Area (according to radio-locator.com map referenced below).\n\n===1990s-2010s===\n[[Image:Kgocopter03162006.jpg|252px|thumb|right|KGO Helicopter.]]  \nUntil December 5, 2011, KGO created nearly all of its own local programming, with very limited syndicated content. The majority of its programs were hosted by [[San Francisco Bay Area]] broadcasters{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The daily schedule included many issues-oriented talk shows, with weekday hosts that included [[Gene Burns]], [[Gil Gross]], [[Ronn Owens]], [[John Rothmann]] and lawyer [[Len Tillem]]. The station also carried a variety of specialty programs, particularly on weekends, with [[John Hamilton (broadcaster)|John Hamilton]] discussing travel and leisure, [[Gene Burns]] covering fine food and dining (on a show separate from his weekday program), [[Joanie Greggains]] hosting a health-and-fitness program, and Brent Walters, who teaches \"Comparative Religions\" at [[San Jose State University]], hosting the early Sunday morning show, ''God Talk.'' In 2014, KGO brought in John Batchelor at midnight.  News/talk weekend hosts now include [[Brian Copeland]], \"Karel\" [[Charles Karel Bouley]], and Pat Thurston.\n\nThe weekday morning news (from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m.) is currently co-anchored by Jon Bristow and Jennifer Jones-Lee.<ref name=\"Morn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kgoam810.com/showdj.asp?DJID=3616 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213095033/http://www.kgoam810.com/showdj.asp?djid=3616 |archivedate=December 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The afternoon news (from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m.) currently features veteran reporter Chris Brecher and award-winning reporter/anchor Bret Burkhart.<ref name=\"drive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kgoam810.com/showdj.asp?DJID=3617 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923183421/http://www.kgoam810.com/showdj.asp?DJID=3617 |archivedate=September 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn Friday, December 2, 2011, new owner Cumulus Media announced that KGO was rebranding itself as \"news and information,\" moving to an [[All-news radio|all-news]] format from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. (in addition to the existing morning-drive, noon-hour and afternoon-drive news blocks) on December 5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kgoam810.com/Article.asp?id=2346801 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415014855/http://www.kgoam810.com/Article.asp?id=2346801 |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/54596/major-shakeup-at-kgo-san-francisco/|title=Major Shakeup At KGO San Francisco - RadioInsight|author=|date=December 5, 2011|website=radioinsight.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> This had resulted in the abrupt termination, on December 1, of most of the talk hosts (including [[Gene Burns]], [[Gil Gross]], [[John Rothmann]], [[Ray Taliaferro]], [[Len Tillem]], and Dr. [[Bill Wattenburg]]).
