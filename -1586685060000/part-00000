After that, PewDiePie held the lead for 2 weeks, before T-Series passed him permanently, reaching 100 million subscribers on 29 May 2019.\n\nMany [[YouTuber]]s voiced their support for PewDiePie, including [[MrBeast]], [[Markiplier]], [[Jacksepticeye]], [[Captain Sparklez]], [[KSI (entertainer)|KSI]] and [[Logan Paul]]. Many of PewDiePie's fans made efforts to gain subscribers for his channel through numerous methods such as through organised marches and supportive YouTube videos. Supporters of PewDiePie often used the slogan \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\". The activism of some PewDiePie supporters extended beyond legal grounds; vandalism, hackings of websites, social media accounts, personal devices and the creation of [[malware]] have taken place in order to tell people to subscribe. \"[[Bitch Lasagna]]\", a [[diss track]] by PewDiePie, and use of [[Anti-Indian sentiment|anti-Indian]] remarks by fans of PewDiePie led to several prominent Indian YouTubers to publicly oppose PewDiePie and back T-Series with YouTube videos and response diss tracks. On 28 April, PewDiePie released a video calling for his supporters to end their efforts to keep him as the most subscribed channel, and with the significant lead now held by T-Series, along with both channels surpassing 100 million subscribers, the competition is generally presumed to have ended with T-Series winning.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg]], known online as PewDiePie, is a Swedish YouTuber who makes comedy and video commentary videos. He has previously been known for his [[Let's Play]] videos. PewDiePie's channel had the most subscribers from 2013 until 22 February 2019, when he was finally surpassed by T-Series, although PewDiePie took back the top spot shortly after approximately 8 minutes.<ref name=\"dethroned1\" /><ref name=\"dethroned2\" /> He refers to his fan base as the \"9-year-old army\"<!--Please discuss on the talk page before adding other nicknames; this is just a summary about PewDiePie.-->.{{r|Alexander2018b}}\n\n[[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] is an Indian music record label and film production company. On YouTube, it has a [[multi-channel network]] consisting of 29 channels (excluding Lahari music),{{r|bloomberg}} run by a team of 13 people.{{r|biswas}} The main T-Series channel primarily contains Indian music videos ([[Bollywood music]] and [[Indi-pop]]) as well as [[Bollywood]] film trailers, and uploads several videos every day, and has uploaded 13.7 thousand videos as of August 2019.{{r|biswas|cnbc}}\n\n== Activism ==\n=== Support of PewDiePie ===\n==== By YouTubers ====\nThe first prominent YouTuber to support PewDiePie was [[MrBeast]] (Jimmy Donaldson), who bought billboards and radio advertisements in [[North Carolina]] urging people to subscribe to PewDiePie's channel.{{r|indArt}} He also created a video of himself saying \"PewDiePie\" 100,000 times in a period of over 12 hours.{{r|varTodd0320}} MrBeast and his friends attended [[Super Bowl LIII]], wearing T-shirts reading \"Sub 2 PewDiePie\". The group was prominently displayed in an ESPN tweet after [[Stephen Gostkowski]] had missed a field goal during the 1st quarter.{{r|sbliii|cnetFeb}}\n\nOther prominent [[YouTuber]]s have publicly campaigned for subscribing to PewDiePie, while others such as [[Markiplier]], [[Jacksepticeye]] and [[Logan Paul]] have made videos or [[Tweets (Twitter)|tweets]] announcing their support for PewDiePie in the competition, often under the [[slogan]], \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\".{{r|LP|charity|sbliii|polygonGrats}} YouTuber Justin Roberts, a member of the group [[Team 10 (YouTube group)|Team 10]], bought a billboard in [[New York City|New York's]] [[Times Square]] saying the same.{{r|varBL|guardian}} Markiplier made a tongue-in-cheek [[Live streaming|live stream]] titled \"I literally won't shut up until you subscribe to PewDiePie\" telling his viewers to subscribe to PewDiePie's channel.{{r|charity|varBL|guardian}} Jacksepticeye did a live stream telling his viewers to subscribe to PewDiePie's channel and jokingly threatened to delete his channel if T-Series surpasses PewDiePie.{{r|cnetFeb}}\n\nSmaller YouTubers have also promoted PewDiePie. In reaction to MrBeast's advertising campaign, Saimandar Waghdhare, an independent Indian YouTuber with the channel \"Saiman Says\", responded to MrBeast's advertising campaign by posting a sarcastic video in which he pretends to support T-Series. However, he later released a video in which he declares his support to PewDiePie.{{r|Midday}} Musician [[Davie504]] flew from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Noida]] and played \"[[Bitch Lasagna]]\", PewDiePie's satirical [[Diss (music)|diss track]] against T-Series, outside their headquarters on a [[bass guitar]].{{r|HongKong}}\n\n''[[YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind]]'', the 2018 video edition of [[YouTube Rewind|the annual YouTube recap]], became [[List of most-disliked YouTube videos|the most-disliked video]] on the platform after a heavy backlash. One of the cited reasons for the criticism was the lack of coverage of the competition between PewDiePie and T-Series.{{r|rewind}} YouTuber Jaiden Animations, however, had contributed to the video, and her animation includes several hidden icons and objects related to PewDiePie.{{r|jaiden}}\n\n==== Hackings ====\nA [[Security hacker|hacker]] under the pseudonym \"HackerGiraffe\" sent print jobs to around 50,000 vulnerable printers in November, and another hacker under the pseudonym \"j3ws3r\" did the same to around 80,000 printers in December.{{r|BBC1|BBC2|Wired}} Messages were printed out saying \"PewDiePie is in trouble and he needs your help to defeat T-Series!\" and urging printer users to subscribe to PewDiePie, unsubscribe from T-Series, and fix their printer. HackerGiraffe claimed that he had discovered more than 800,000 vulnerable printers using the search engine [[Shodan (website)|Shodan]] used for finding vulnerable devices.{{r|guardian|indHack}} In January 2019, more than 65,000 of [[Google]]\u2019s [[Chromecast]] streaming dongles were hacked by HackerGiraffe and j3ws3r, displaying a message on [[smart TV]]s urging people to subscribe to PewDiePie and adjust their security settings.{{r|cnet|Forbes hack}} However, despite positive feedback from some people, one of the hackers anonymously revealed to the [[BBC]] that he suffered a breakdown due to the prospect of facing jail time and angry messages urging him to commit suicide. Both hackers are in hiding, but do not regret their decisions due to a lower number of vulnerable printers which they believe is due to their hack.{{r|BBC3}} Also in January, dozens of [[Google Nest|Nest]] cameras were compromised by a hacker under the pseudonym \"SydeFX\" using [[credential stuffing]], who spoke to victims through the cameras, demanding they subscribe to PewDiePie.{{r|ViceMotherboard}}\n\nHacking was not limited to hardware. In December 2018, one of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''{{'s}} websites was hacked to display a message apologising for articles accusing PewDiePie of anti-Semitism and to tell readers to subscribe to his channel.{{r|guardian|indHack}} The hacker j3ws3r also took down T-Series' website with a [[denial-of-service attack]].{{r|Wired}} In February 2019, [[Bob Buckhorn]], the mayor of [[Tampa, Florida]], had his [[Twitter]] account hacked to post many malicious tweets one of these being to encourage users to subscribe to PewDiePie.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/5534489/tampa-mayor-twitter-hacked/ |title=A Hacker Took Over the Tampa Mayor's Twitter and Sent a Fake Ballistic Missile Warning and Bomb Threat |last=Steer |first=George |date=21 February 2019 |publisher=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321000048/http://time.com/5534489/tampa-mayor-twitter-hacked/ |archive-date=21 March 2019 |access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> On 22 March 2019, a user on the PewDiePie [[subreddit]] developed ransomware by the name PewCrypt that encrypted files on [[Microsoft Windows]] machines. The attacker claimed he would release an encryption key when PewDiePie hit the 100 million Subscriber milestone, however, the author claimed that if T-Series claims that goal first, the encryption tool would be deleted permanently.{{r|cryptInd}}\n\n==== Other activism ====\nThe [[UK Independence Party]] announced their support for PewDiePie in a tweet.{{r|cnetD3|masihFeb}}\n\nOn 27 February 2019, [[BC \u017dalgiris|Basketball Club \u017dalgiris]] based in [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, had cheerleaders performing to \"Bitch Lasagna\" during a time-out.{{r|zalgiris}}\n\nSeveral marches were held in support of PewDiePie. On 27 February 2019, a parade was held in [[Tallinn, Estonia]] in support of PewDiePie.

As a result, PewDiePie lost over 40,000 subscribers and T-Series lost more than 200,000 subscribers from its main channel.{{r|crackdown}}\n\n=== Media analysis ===\nAnthony Cuthbertson of ''[[The Independent]]'' has described the rivalry as a shift in how established media companies viewed YouTube in 2018.{{r|indOct}} Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Nosheen Iqbal described T-Series as \"a challenger from the streets of Delhi\", in reference to the origins of its founder [[Gulshan Kumar]], who was a fruit juice seller when he founded the company.{{r|guardian}}\n\n[[Vox Media|Vox]]'s Aja Romano says that this competition represents the growing divide of subcultures on YouTube\u2014on one side are the creators who have developed their own channels over the course of YouTube's history, and on the other side sit corporations who use YouTube as a platform to advertise their shows from external platforms.{{r|VoxBeingGood}}\n\nPatricia Hernandez of ''[[The Verge]]'' compared the rivalry to the [[KSI vs Logan Paul]] YouTube boxing match. She described PewDiePie's antagonism as \"all for show\" and stated that \"rivalries play a huge role on YouTube because they give viewers narratives where pseudo-heroes and villains exist with low (if any) stakes.\"{{r|hernandezAug}}\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' has reported that the success of T-Series represents the fast growth of [[Internet in India]] with an increase from 20 million Indians with Internet access in 2000 to 560 million in 2018.{{r|masihFeb}} ''The Post'' noted that India became the second-largest mobile phone market in 2018. It also highlighted mobile data plans in India and noted the importance of voice technology because of the low rate of [[literacy in India]]. Journalist [[Ravi Agrawal]] said that India quickly progressed to cheap mobile phones by skipping slower initial technological advances in the west.{{r|masihFeb}} ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' reported that T-Series' success lies in focusing on regional audiences and that T-Series does not have competitors in online music in India.{{r|WapoDethrone}}\n\n=== Subscriber count live streams ===\nIn September 2018, the YouTube channel FlareTV started a popular [[live stream]] showing the live subscriber counts of both channels, as well as the subscriber difference between the two channels.{{r|flare}} In October 2018, social media statistics and analytics website [[Social Blade]] started a live stream showing similar information,{{r|WapoDethrone}} while including more in-depth statistics such as average subscribers-per-minute for both channels.<ref name=\"walkerRace\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/04/the-dumbest-race-on-the-internet-is-finally-over/ |title=The Dumbest Race On The Internet Is Finally Over |last=Walker |first=Alex |date=1 April 2019 |website=Kotaku Australia |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414142206/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/04/the-dumbest-race-on-the-internet-is-finally-over/ |archive-date=14 April 2019 |access-date=12 April 2019}}</ref> The Social Blade stream concluded on 13 June 2019, and the FlareTV stream concluded on 10 September 2019.<ref>{{Citation |title=PEWDIEPIE VS T-SERIES LIVE SUB COUNT: CELEBRATING 100 MILLION |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVxU2HzPGug |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801212630/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVxU2HzPGug |language=en |access-date=2019-08-03 |archive-date=1 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"wnbc\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subscribers-of-YouTuber-PewDiePie-Felix-Kjellberg-Deface-Brooklyn-WWII-Memorial-506782531.html |title=Brooklyn WWII Memorial Defaced With Call to 'Subscribe' to Controversial Youtuber PewDiePie |last=Chinn |first=Natalie |website=NBC New York |publisher=WNBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308113655/https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subscribers-of-YouTuber-PewDiePie-Felix-Kjellberg-Deface-Brooklyn-WWII-Memorial-506782531.html |archive-date=8 March 2019 |access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cnbc\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/youtube-pewdiepie-set-to-be-overtaken-by-bollywood-channel-t-series.html |title=YouTube's PewDiePie set to be overtaken by Bollywood channel T-Series |last=Browne |first=Ryan |date=26 October 2018 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228035514/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/youtube-pewdiepie-set-to-be-overtaken-by-bollywood-channel-t-series.html |archive-date=28 December 2018 |access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"charity\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124332/pewdiepie-fans-charity-donation-t-series-battle |title=PewDiePie urges his fans to donate to charity as T-Series battle rages on |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |date=3 December 2018 |website=The Verge |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204123521/https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124332/pewdiepie-fans-charity-donation-t-series-battle |archive-date=4 December 2018 |access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WapoDethrone\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/26/pewdiepie-is-youtubes-most-subscribed-channel-hes-about-be-dethroned/ |title=PewDiePie is YouTube\u2019s most-subscribed channel.

T-Series had temporarily overtaken PewDiePie on numerous occasions in 2019, and on 27 March 2019,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/pewdiepie-most-popular-youtube-channel-t-series-sub-count-a8819806.html |title=PewDiePie finally loses world's most popular YouTube channel to Indian music label |date=18 March 2019 |website=The Independent |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329185338/https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/pewdiepie-most-popular-youtube-channel-t-series-sub-count-a8819806.html |archive-date=29 March 2019 |access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> it became the most subscribed channel for five consecutive days before PewDiePie retook the lead. After that, PewDiePie held the lead for 2 weeks, before T-Series passed him permanently, reaching 100 million subscribers on 29 May 2019.\n\nMany [[YouTuber]]s voiced their support for PewDiePie, including [[MrBeast]], [[Markiplier]], [[Jacksepticeye]], [[Captain Sparklez]], [[KSI (entertainer)|KSI]] and [[Logan Paul]]. Many of PewDiePie's fans made efforts to gain subscribers for his channel through numerous methods such as through organised marches and supportive YouTube videos. Supporters of PewDiePie often used the slogan \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\". The activism of some PewDiePie supporters extended beyond legal grounds; vandalism, hackings of websites, social media accounts, personal devices and the creation of [[malware]] have taken place in order to tell people to subscribe. \"[[Bitch Lasagna]]\", a [[diss track]] by PewDiePie, and use of [[Anti-Indian sentiment|anti-Indian]] remarks by fans of PewDiePie led to several prominent Indian YouTubers to publicly oppose PewDiePie and back T-Series with YouTube videos and response diss tracks. On 28 April, PewDiePie released a video calling for his supporters to end their efforts to keep him as the most subscribed channel, and with the significant lead now held by T-Series, along with both channels surpassing 100 million subscribers, the competition is generally presumed to have ended with T-Series winning.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg]], known online as PewDiePie, is a Swedish YouTuber who makes comedy and video commentary videos. He has previously been known for his [[Let's Play]] videos. PewDiePie's channel had the most subscribers from 2013 until 22 February 2019, when he was finally surpassed by T-Series, although PewDiePie took back the top spot shortly after approximately 8 minutes.<ref name=\"dethroned1\" /><ref name=\"dethroned2\" /> He refers to his fan base as the \"9-year-old army\"<!--Please discuss on the talk page before adding other nicknames; this is just a summary about PewDiePie.-->.{{r|Alexander2018b}}\n\n[[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] is an Indian music record label and film production company. On YouTube, it has a [[multi-channel network]] consisting of 29 channels (excluding Lahari music),{{r|bloomberg}} run by a team of 13 people.{{r|biswas}} The main T-Series channel primarily contains Indian music videos ([[Bollywood music]] and [[Indi-pop]]) as well as [[Bollywood]] film trailers, and uploads several videos every day, and has uploaded 13.7 thousand videos as of August 2019.{{r|biswas|cnbc}}\n\n== Activism ==\n=== Support of PewDiePie ===\n==== By YouTubers ====\nThe first prominent YouTuber to support PewDiePie was [[MrBeast]] (Jimmy Donaldson), who bought billboards and radio advertisements in [[North Carolina]] urging people to subscribe to PewDiePie's channel.{{r|indArt}} He also created a video of himself saying \"PewDiePie\" 100,000 times in a period of over 12 hours.{{r|varTodd0320}} MrBeast and his friends attended [[Super Bowl LIII]], wearing T-shirts reading \"Sub 2 PewDiePie\". The group was prominently displayed in an ESPN tweet after [[Stephen Gostkowski]] had missed a field goal during the 1st quarter.{{r|sbliii|cnetFeb}}\n\nOther prominent [[YouTuber]]s have publicly campaigned for subscribing to PewDiePie, while others such as [[Markiplier]], [[Jacksepticeye]] and [[Logan Paul]] have made videos or [[Tweets (Twitter)|tweets]] announcing their support for PewDiePie in the competition, often under the [[slogan]], \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\".{{r|LP|charity|sbliii|polygonGrats}} YouTuber Justin Roberts, a member of the group [[Team 10 (YouTube group)|Team 10]], bought a billboard in [[New York City|New York's]] [[Times Square]] saying the same.{{r|varBL|guardian}} Markiplier made a tongue-in-cheek [[Live streaming|live stream]] titled \"I literally won't shut up until you subscribe to PewDiePie\" telling his viewers to subscribe to PewDiePie's channel.{{r|charity|varBL|guardian}} Jacksepticeye did a live stream telling his viewers to subscribe to PewDiePie's channel and jokingly threatened to delete his channel if T-Series surpasses PewDiePie.{{r|cnetFeb}}\n\nSmaller YouTubers have also promoted PewDiePie. In reaction to MrBeast's advertising campaign, Saimandar Waghdhare, an independent Indian YouTuber with the channel \"Saiman Says\", responded to MrBeast's advertising campaign by posting a sarcastic video in which he pretends to support T-Series. However, he later released a video in which he declares his support to PewDiePie.{{r|Midday}} Musician Davie504 flew from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Noida]] and played \"[[Bitch Lasagna]]\", PewDiePie's satirical [[Diss (music)|diss track]] against T-Series, outside their headquarters on a [[bass guitar]].{{r|HongKong}}\n\n''[[YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind]]'', the 2018 video edition of [[YouTube Rewind|the annual YouTube recap]], became [[List of most-disliked YouTube videos|the most-disliked video]] on the platform after a heavy backlash. One of the cited reasons for the criticism was the lack of coverage of the competition between PewDiePie and T-Series.{{r|rewind}} YouTuber Jaiden Animations, however, had contributed to the video, and her animation includes several hidden icons and objects related to PewDiePie.{{r|jaiden}}\n\n==== Hackings ====\nA [[Security hacker|hacker]] under the pseudonym \"HackerGiraffe\" sent print jobs to around 50,000 vulnerable printers in November, and another hacker under the pseudonym \"j3ws3r\" did the same to around 80,000 printers in December.{{r|BBC1|BBC2|Wired}} Messages were printed out saying \"PewDiePie is in trouble and he needs your help to defeat T-Series!\" and urging printer users to subscribe to PewDiePie, unsubscribe from T-Series, and fix their printer. HackerGiraffe claimed that he had discovered more than 800,000 vulnerable printers using the search engine [[Shodan (website)|Shodan]] used for finding vulnerable devices.{{r|guardian|indHack}} In January 2019, more than 65,000 of [[Google]]\u2019s [[Chromecast]] streaming dongles were hacked by HackerGiraffe and j3ws3r, displaying a message on [[smart TV]]s urging people to subscribe to PewDiePie and adjust their security settings.{{r|cnet|Forbes hack}} However, despite positive feedback from some people, one of the hackers anonymously revealed to the [[BBC]] that he suffered a breakdown due to the prospect of facing jail time and angry messages urging him to commit suicide. Both hackers are in hiding, but do not regret their decisions due to a lower number of vulnerable printers which they believe is due to their hack.{{r|BBC3}} Also in January, dozens of [[Google Nest|Nest]] cameras were compromised by a hacker under the pseudonym \"SydeFX\" using [[credential stuffing]], who spoke to victims through the cameras, demanding they subscribe to PewDiePie.{{r|ViceMotherboard}}\n\nHacking was not limited to hardware. In December 2018, one of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''{{'s}} websites was hacked to display a message apologising for articles accusing PewDiePie of anti-Semitism and to tell readers to subscribe to his channel.{{r|guardian|indHack}} The hacker j3ws3r also took down T-Series' website with a [[denial-of-service attack]].{{r|Wired}} In February 2019, [[Bob Buckhorn]], the mayor of [[Tampa, Florida]], had his [[Twitter]] account hacked to post many malicious tweets one of these being to encourage users to subscribe to PewDiePie.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/5534489/tampa-mayor-twitter-hacked/ |title=A Hacker Took Over the Tampa Mayor's Twitter and Sent a Fake Ballistic Missile Warning and Bomb Threat |last=Steer |first=George |date=21 February 2019 |publisher=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321000048/http://time.com/5534489/tampa-mayor-twitter-hacked/ |archive-date=21 March 2019 |access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> On 22 March 2019, a user on the PewDiePie [[subreddit]] developed ransomware by the name PewCrypt that encrypted files on [[Microsoft Windows]] machines. The attacker claimed he would release an encryption key when PewDiePie hit the 100 million Subscriber milestone, however, the author claimed that if T-Series claims that goal first, the encryption tool would be deleted permanently.{{r|cryptInd}}\n\n==== Other activism ====\nThe [[UK Independence Party]] announced their support for PewDiePie in a tweet.{{r|cnetD3|masihFeb}}\n\nOn 27 February 2019, [[BC \u017dalgiris|Basketball Club \u017dalgiris]] based in [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, had cheerleaders performing to \"Bitch Lasagna\" during a time-out.{{r|zalgiris}}\n\nSeveral marches were held in support of PewDiePie. On 27 February 2019, a parade was held in [[Tallinn, Estonia]] in support of PewDiePie. Up to several hundreds of people took part in the march, which went through [[Vanalinn|Tallinn's Old Town]] and other busy areas of the city centre.{{r|Tallinn2|brooklyn}} During the [[2019 India\u2013Pakistan standoff]], T-Series removed the music of [[Pakistani pop]] artists from its channel. In response, there was a march in [[Pakistan]] where protesters held signs reading \"Unsubscribe T-Series\" and expressed support for PewDiePie.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://zeenews.india.com/viral/pewdiepie-under-fire-for-india-pakistan-comments-amid-youtube-supremacy-race-with-t-series-2187254.html |title=PewDiePie under fire for India-Pakistan comments amid YouTube supremacy race with T-Series |date=13 March 2019 |website=[[Zee News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321163331/https://zeenews.india.com/viral/pewdiepie-under-fire-for-india-pakistan-comments-amid-youtube-supremacy-race-with-t-series-2187254.html |archive-date=21 March 2019 |access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> On 10 March 2019, a rally was held in [[Moscow]] for [[internet freedom]], coordinated by the [[Libertarian Party of Russia]].

PewDiePie's \"Bitch Lasagna\" diss track contained some derogatory lyrics about Indian people that some Indians found offensive. Many of PewDiePie's fans have engaged in negatively spamming and [[trolling]] the T-Series channel,{{r|DNAIndia}} which included swarming T-Series' videos with PewDiePie-related comments, disliking videos, and flagging their videos with false reports.{{r|hernandezAug}} A number of PewDiePie's fans and supporters have also been making [[anti-Indian]] remarks and using [[racial slur]]s.{{r|Quint|Scroll}} This has led to several independent Indian YouTubers announcing their opposition to PewDiePie and support for T-Series.{{r|Scroll|Quint}}\nIn November 2018, [[Indian-Canadian]] comedian and YouTuber [[Jus Reign]] uploaded a video called \"In Defense of T-Series\", where he talks about T-Series, mentions his childhood listening to their music, and shows a short music video at the end celebrating T-Series.{{r|Pinkvilla}}\nIn response to PewDiePie's \"Bitch Lasagna\" diss track, several Indian YouTubers responded with their own [[Hindi]]-language diss tracks against PewDiePie. Tatva K released his diss track \"Pew Ki Pie\" in November 2018, followed by Asif Bantaye releasing his diss track \"PENDUBHAI\" in December 2018. On 1 January 2019, [[CarryMinati]], a [[PUBG]] player and one of India's top ten YouTubers, released a diss track called \"Bye PewDiePie\", which garnered nearly 5{{nbsp}}million views within 24 hours.{{r|Scroll|Quint}}\n\n== Responses ==\n=== PewDiePie ===\nIn August 2018, PewDiePie posted a video titled \"this channel will overtake PewDiePie\" in which he jokingly rallied his fans against T-Series.

I think people enjoy this connection so much, I think something else will just show up, if it feels too corporate.\"{{r|indOct}} He also blamed YouTube for a lack of support toward individual YouTubers.{{r|indArt}} Speaking to ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' in November 2018, PewDiePie said that he was, \"surprised no one has stepped up sooner\", referring to T-Series competing for the most-subscribed spot.{{r|MetroInterview}}\n\nIn December 2018, as the gap between the numbers of subscribers rapidly shrank, multiple high-profile YouTubers posted videos supporting him. PewDiePie made a video the next day calling for his viewers to support the Indian non-governmental organization [[Child Rights and You]], in response to some of his fans' [[anti-Indian sentiment]]. He raised {{currency|173682|GBP}}, including a donation by ''[[Minecraft]]'' creator [[Markus Persson]], and also ran a charity live stream the next day.{{r|charity|sekhoseC}}\n\nOn 3 February 2019, PewDiePie live-streamed himself playing [[Fortnite Battle Royale|''Fortnite'']] on YouTube to try and stop T-Series from surpassing him.{{r|Fortnite}} A week later, PewDiePie did another live stream in an attempt to stay ahead of T-Series, this time playing ''[[Roblox]]''.

These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.<ref name=\"mba.ufm.edu.gt\">Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ib\u00e1rg\u00fcen Snr.: \"A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies\" (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn]], March 2006) p. 41, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084545/http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf UFM.edu.gt]</ref>\n\nThe [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new [[regulations]] to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.<ref name=\"mba.ufm.edu.gt\"/>\n\nIn addition to being the largest [[bankruptcy]] reorganization in American history, the [[Enron scandal]] undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure.<ref>Bratton, William W. \"Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value\" ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61</ref> It involved a [[Accounting scandals|financial scandal]] of [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] and their auditors [[Arthur Andersen]], which was revealed in late 2001. The scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.<ref>{{cite news | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | work = BBC News | date = 2001-12-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | accessdate = 15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOne consequence of these events was the passage of [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] in the [[United States]] 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.<ref>Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z.

As part of the Queen's Campus historic district, Geology Hall was included on the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973. When Rutgers was selected as New Jersey's only [[Land-grant university|land grant college]] in 1864, the college began to expand its curriculum to include instruction in science and agriculture.

The museum, the oldest collegiate geology museum in the United States, was founded by state geologist and Rutgers professor [[George Hammell Cook]] in 1872. Its exhibits showcase the [[natural history]] of New Jersey; focusing [[geology]], [[paleontology]], and [[anthropology]]. Exhibits include fluorescent zinc minerals from [[Franklin, New Jersey|Franklin]] and [[Ogdensburg, New Jersey|Ogdensburg]], a [[mastodon]] from [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]], a dinosaur trackway discovered in [[Towaco, New Jersey|Towaco]], and a [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic era]] Egyptian [[mummy]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Rutgers University}}\n[[File:Geology Hall, 1910.png|thumb|Geology Hall in 1910.]]\nIn 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College as their sole [[Land-grant university|land grant college]].
