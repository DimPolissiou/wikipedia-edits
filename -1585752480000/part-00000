Resistance continued until the last independent sultan, [['Asil Kolak]], was captured in 1912 bringing the independence of the sultanate to an end.\n\nThe Wadai Sultanate was reconstituted under French suzerainty in 1935, with [[Muhammad Urada ibn Ibrahim]] becoming Kolak, or sultan. The sultanate continues under the suzerainty of the Republic of Chad and its current Kolak since 1977 is [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad Urada]].\n\nIt became part of the independent Republic of [[Chad]] on that country's independence in 1960. The [[Ouadda\u00ef Region]] of modern Chad covers part of the area of the old kingdom.

Resistance continued until the last independent sultan, [['Asil Kolak]], was captured in 1912 bringing the independence of the sultanate to an end.\n\nThe Wadai Sultanate was reconstituted under French suzerainty in 1935, with [[Muhammad Urada ibn Ibrahim]] becoming Kolak, or sultan. The sultanate continues under the suzerainty of the Republic of Chad and its current Kolak since 1977 is [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad Urada]].\n\nIt became part of the independent Republic of [[Chad]] on that country's independence in 1960. The [[Ouadda\u00ef Region]] of modern Chad covers part of the area of the old kingdom.

Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under [[open source license]]s that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular [[toolchain|software tool chain]]s. \n\nRISC-V has features to increase computer speed, yet reduce cost and power use. These include a [[load\u2013store architecture]], bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, simplified standards-based floating-point, a design that is architecturally neutral, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed [[sign extension]]. Sign extension is said to often be on the critical timing path.<ref name=\"isa\" />\nThe instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. It is variable-width and extensible so that more encoding bits can always be added. It supports three word-widths, 32, 64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets. The definitions of each subset vary slightly for the three word-widths. The subsets support small [[embedded system]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[supercomputer]]s with vector processors, and warehouse-scale rack-mounted [[Parallel computing|parallel computers]]. \n\nThe instruction set space for the 128-bit stretched version of the ISA was reserved because 60 years of industry experience has shown that the most unrecoverable error in instruction set design is a lack of memory address space. {{As of|2016}}, the 128-bit ISA remains undefined intentionally, because there is yet so little practical experience with such large memory systems.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are proposals to implement variable-width instructions up to 864-bits.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolf |first1=Clifford |title=Alternative proposal for instruction length encoding |url=http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2019/rvlonginsn/proposal_1.txt |website=Cliffords Subversion Servier |publisher=Clifford Wolf |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe project began in 2010 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but many contributors are volunteers not affiliated with the university.<ref name=\"contributors\" /> Unlike other academic designs which are typically optimized only for simplicity of exposition, the designers intended that the RISC-V instruction set be useable for practical computers. \n\nAs of June 2019, version 2.2 of the user-space ISA<ref name=\"isa\" /> and version 1.11 of the privileged ISA<ref name=priv-isa/> are [[Freeze (software engineering)|frozen]], permitting software and hardware development to proceed.

To cover the costs of such a team, commercial vendors of computer designs, such as [[ARM Holdings]] and [[MIPS Technologies]] charge [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for the use of their designs, [[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/07/a-long-look-at-how-arm-licenses-chips/ |title=A long look at how ARM licenses chips: Part 1 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/08/how-arm-licenses-its-ip-for-production/ |title=How ARM licenses its IP for production: Part 2 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 8, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackster.io/news/wave-computing-closes-its-mips-open-initiative-with-immediate-effect-zero-warning-e88b0df9acd0|title=Wave Computing Closes Its MIPS Open Initiative with Immediate Effect, Zero Warning|date=2019-11-15}}</ref> They also often require [[non-disclosure agreement]]s before releasing documents that describe their designs' detailed advantages. In many cases, they never describe the reasons for their design choices.\n\nRISC-V was started to solve these problems. The goal was to make a practical ISA that was open-sourced, usable academically and in any hardware or software design without royalties.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" /> Also, the rationales for every part of the project are explained, at least broadly. The RISC-V authors are academic but have substantial experience in computer design. The RISC-V ISA is a direct development from a series of academic computer-design projects. It was originated in part to aid such projects.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nIn order to build a large, continuing community of users and therefore accumulate designs and software, the RISC-V ISA designers planned to support a wide variety of practical uses: Small, fast, and low-power real-world implementations,<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"rocketsspeed\" /> without over-architecting for a particular [[microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=sodor>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |last2=Love |first2=Eric |title=ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |url=https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |website=GitHub Inc. |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"shakti\" /><ref name=boom>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |title=CS 152 Laboratory Exercise 3 |url=http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp14/handouts/lab3.pdf |website=UC Berkeley |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref> A need for a large base of contributors is part of the reason why RISC-V was engineered to fit so many uses.\n\nThe designers say that the instruction set is the main interface in a computer because it lies between the hardware and the software. If a good instruction set was open, available for use by all, it should dramatically reduce the cost of software by permitting far more reuse. It should also increase competition among hardware providers, who can use more resources for design and less for software support.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nThe designers assert that new principles are becoming rare in instruction set design, as the most successful designs of the last forty years have become increasingly similar. Of those that failed, most did so because their sponsoring companies failed commercially, not because the instruction sets were poor technically. So, a well-designed open instruction set designed using well-established principles should attract long-term support by many vendors.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nRISC-V also supports the designers' academic uses. The simplicity of the integer subset permits basic student exercises. The integer subset is a simple ISA enabling software to control research machines. The variable-length ISA enables extensions for both student exercises and research.<ref name=\"isa\" /> The separated privileged instruction set permits research in operating system support, without redesigning compilers.<ref name=\"isapriv\" /> RISC-V's open intellectual property allows its designs to be published, reused, and modified.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n==History==\nThe term ''[[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]'' dates from about 1980.<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> Before this, there was some knowledge that simpler computers could be effective, but the design principles were not widely described. Simple, effective computers have always been of academic interest. Academics created the RISC instruction set [[DLX]] for the first edition of ''Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1990. [[David Patterson (computer scientist)|David Patterson]] was an author, and later assisted RISC-V. DLX was intended for educational use; academics and hobbyists implemented it using [[field-programmable gate array]]s, but it was not a commercial success. ARM CPUs, versions 2 and earlier, had a public-domain instruction set, and it is still supported by the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), a popular free-software compiler. Three open-source [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|cores]] exist for this ISA, but they have not been manufactured.<ref name=\"amber\" /><ref name=\"arm4u\" /> [[OpenRISC]] is an open-source ISA based on DLX, with associated RISC designs. It is fully supported with GCC and [[Linux]] implementations. However, it has few commercial implementations.\n\n[[Krste Asanovi\u0107]] at the University of California, Berkeley, found many uses for an open-source computer system. In 2010, he decided to develop and publish one in a \"short, three-month project over the summer\". The plan was to help both academic and industrial users.<ref name=\"isasbfree\">{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-146.pdf |title=Instruction Sets Should be Free |last=Asanovi\u0107 |first=Krste |author-link=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=U.C.

He originally identified the properties of [[Berkeley RISC]],<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> and RISC-V is one of his long series of cooperative RISC research projects. At this stage, students inexpensively provided initial software, simulations, and CPU designs.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe RISC-V authors and their institution originally provided the ISA documents and several CPU designs under [[BSD licenses]], which allow derivative works\u2014such as RISC-V chip designs\u2014to be either open and free, or closed and proprietary. The ISA specification itself (i.e., the encoding of the instruction set) was effectively put into the public domain when the ISA tech reports were published, though the actual tech report text (an expression of the specification) was later put under a Creative Commons license to allow it to be improved by external contributors including the RISC-V Foundation.\n\nA full history of RISC-V has been published on the RISC-V Foundation website.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Foundation===\nCommercial users require an ISA to be stable before they can utilize it in a product that might last many years. To address this issue, the RISC-V Foundation was formed to own, maintain and publish intellectual property related to RISC-V's definition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/10/03/a-new-blueprint-for-microprocessors-challenges-the-industrys-giants|title=A new blueprint for microprocessors challenges the industry's giants|date=2019-10-03|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-11-10|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The original authors and owners have surrendered their rights to the foundation.<ref name=\"rv5_found\">{{cite web |title=RISC-V Foundation |url=https://riscv.org/risc-v-foundation/ |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, the RISC-V Foundation announced that it would re-locate to [[Switzerland]], citing concerns over U.S. trade regulations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-semiconductors-insight-idUSKBN1XZ16L|title=U.S.-based chip-tech group moving to Switzerland over trade curb fears|date=2019-11-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the foundation freely publishes the documents defining RISC-V and permits unrestricted utilization of the ISA for both software and hardware design.

The ISA base and its extensions are developed in a collective effort between industry, the research community and educational institutions. The base specifies instructions (and their encoding), control flow, registers (and their sizes), memory and addressing, logic (i.e., integer) manipulation, and ancillaries. The base alone can implement a simplified general-purpose computer, with full software support, including a general-purpose compiler.\n\nThe standard extensions are specified to work with all of the standard bases, and with each other without conflict.\n\nMany RISC-V computers might implement the compact extension to reduce power consumption, code size, and memory use.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are also future plans to support [[hypervisor]]s and [[virtualization]].<ref name=\"isapriv\">\n{{cite web\n | last         = Waterman\n | first        = Andrew\n | last2        = Lee\n | first2       = Yunsup\n | last3        = Avizienas\n | first3       = Rimas\n | last4        = Patterson\n | first4       = David\n | author-link4 = David Patterson (computer scientist)\n | last5        = Asanovi\u0107\n | first5       = Krste\n | author-link5 = Krste Asanovi\u0107\n | title        = Draft Privileged ISA Specification 1.9\n | url          = https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/\n | website      = RISC-V\n | publisher    = RISC-V Foundation\n | access-date  = 30 August 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nTogether with a supervisor instruction set extension, S, an RVGC defines all instructions needed to conveniently support a general purpose [[operating system]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ ISA base and extensions\n|-\n!

Except for memory access instructions, instructions address only registers.\n\nThe first integer register is a zero register, and the remainder are general-purpose registers. A store to the zero register has no effect, and a read always provides 0. Using the zero register as a placeholder makes for a simpler instruction set.\n\n{{code|move rx to ry}} becomes {{code|add r0 to rx and store in ry}}.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nControl and status registers exist, but user-mode programs can access only those used for performance measurement and floating-point management.\n\nNo instructions exist to save and restore multiple registers. Those were thought to be needless, too complex, and perhaps too slow.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Memory access===\nLike many RISC designs, RISC-V is a [[load\u2013store architecture]]: instructions address only registers, with load and store instructions conveying to and from memory.\n\nMost load and store instructions include a 12-bit offset and two register identifiers. One register is the base register. The other register is the source (for a store) or destination (for a load.)\n\nThe offset is added to a base register to get the address. Forming the address as a base register plus offset allows single instructions to access data structures. For example, if the base register points to the top of a stack, single instructions can access a subroutine's local variables in the stack. Likewise the load and store instructions can access a record-style structure or a memory-mapped I/O device. Using the constant zero register as a base address allows single instructions to access memory near address zero.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nMemory is addressed as 8-bit bytes, with words being in [[little-endian]] order.<ref name=\"isa\" /> Words, up to the register size, can be accessed with the load and store instructions.\n\nAccessed memory addresses need not be aligned to their word-width, but accesses to aligned addresses may be faster; for example, simple CPUs may implement unaligned accesses with slow software emulation driven from an alignment failure interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nLike many RISC instruction sets (and some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) instruction sets, such as [[x86]] and [[IBM System/360]] families), RISC-V lacks address-modes that write back to the registers. For example, it does not auto-increment.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V manages memory systems that are shared between CPUs or [[thread (computing)|threads]] by ensuring a thread of execution always sees its memory operations in the programmed order. But between threads and I/O devices, RISC-V is simplified: It doesn't guarantee the order of memory operations, except by specific instructions, such as {{code|fence}}.\n\nA {{code|fence}} instruction guarantees that the results of predecessor operations are visible to successor operations of other threads or I/O devices. {{code|fence}} can guarantee the order of combinations of both memory and memory-mapped I/O operations. E.g. it can separate memory read and write operations, without affecting I/O operations. Or, if a system can operate I/O devices in parallel with memory, {{code|fence}} doesn't force them to wait for each other. One CPU with one thread may decode {{code|fence}} as {{code|nop}}.\n\nRISC-V is little-endian to resemble other familiar, successful computers, for example, [[x86]]. This also reduces a CPU's complexity and costs slightly because it reads all sizes of words in the same order. For example, the RISC-V instruction set decodes starting at the lowest-addressed byte of the instruction. The specification leaves open the possibility of non-standard big-endian or bi-endian systems.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome RISC CPUs (such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[DLX]], and Berkeley's RISC-I) place 16 bits of offset in the loads and stores. They set the upper 16 bits by a ''load upper word'' instruction. This permits upper-halfword values to be set easily, without shifting bits. However, most use of the upper half-word instruction makes 32-bit constants, like addresses. RISC-V uses a [[SPARC]]-like combination of 12-bit offsets and 20-bit ''set upper'' instructions. The smaller 12-bit offset helps compact, 32-bit load and store instructions select two of 32 registers yet still have enough bits to support RISC-V's variable-length instruction coding.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Immediates===\nRISC-V handles 32-bit constants and addresses with instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit register. Load upper immediate {{code|lui}} loads 20 bits into bits 31 through 12. Then a second instruction such as {{code|addi}} can set the bottom 12 bits.\n\nThis method is extended to permit [[position-independent code]] by adding an instruction, {{code|auipc}} that generates 20 upper address bits by adding an offset to the program counter and storing the result into a base register. This permits a program to generate 32-bit addresses that are relative to the program counter.\n\nThe base register can often be used as-is with the 12-bit offsets of the loads and stores. If needed, {{code|addi}} can set the lower 12-bits of a register. In 64-bit and 128-bit ISAs,{{code|lui}} and {{code|auipc}} sign-extend the result to get the larger address.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome fast CPUs may interpret combinations of instructions as single ''fused'' instructions. {{code|lui}} or {{code|auipc}} may be good candidates to fuse with {{code|addi}}, loads or stores.\n\n===Subroutine calls, jumps, and branches===\nRISC-V's subroutine call {{code|jal}} (jump and link) places its return address in a register. This is faster in many computer designs, because it saves a memory access compared to systems that push a return address directly on a stack in memory. {{code|jal}} has a 20-bit signed (2's complement) offset. The offset is multiplied by 2, then added to the PC to generate a relative address to a 32-bit instruction. If the result is not at a 32-bit address (i.e., evenly divisible by 4), the CPU may force an [[Exception handling|exception]].<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V CPUs jump to calculated addresses using a ''jump and link-register'', {{code|jalr}} instruction. {{code|jalr}} is similar to {{code|jal}}, but gets its destination address by adding a 12-bit offset to a base register. (In contrast,{{code|jal}} adds a larger 20-bit offset to the PC.)\n\n{{code|jalr}}'s bit format is like the register-relative loads and stores. Like them, {{code|jalr}} can be used with the instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a base register to make 32-bit branches, either to an absolute address (using {{code|lui}}) or a PC-relative one (using {{code|auipc}} for [[position-independent code]]). (Using a constant zero base address allows single-instruction calls to a small (the offset), fixed positive or negative address.)\n\nRISC-V recycles {{code|jal}} and {{code|jalr}} to get unconditional 20-bit PC-relative jumps and unconditional register-based 12-bit jumps. Jumps just make the linkage register 0 so that no return address is saved.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V also recycles {{code|jalr}} to return from a subroutine: To do this, {{code|jalr}}'s base register is set to be the linkage register saved by {{code|jal}} or {{code|jalr}}. {{code|jalr}}'s offset is zero and the linkage register is zero, so that there is no offset, and no return address is saved.\n\nLike many RISC designs, in a subroutine call, a RISC-V compiler must use individual instructions to save registers to the stack at the start, and then restore these from the stack on exit. RISC-V has no ''save multiple'' or ''restore multiple'' register instructions. These were thought to make the CPU too complex, and possibly slow.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> This can take more code space. Designers planned to reduce code size with library routines to save and restore registers.<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nRISC-V has no [[condition code register]] or [[carry bit]]. The designers believed that condition codes make fast CPUs more complex by forcing interactions between instructions in different stages of execution. This choice makes multiple-precision arithmetic more complex. Also, a few numerical tasks need more energy. As a result, [[Branch predication|predication]] (the conditional execution of instructions) is not supported. The designers claim that very fast, out-of-order CPU designs do predication anyway, by doing the comparison branch and conditional code in parallel, then discarding the unused path's effects. They also claim that even in simpler CPUs, predication is less valuable than [[branch prediction]], which can prevent most stalls associated with conditional branches. Code without predication is larger, with more branches, but they also claim that a compressed instruction set (such as RISC-V's set ''C'') solves that problem in most cases.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nInstead, RISC-V has short branches that perform comparisons: equal, not-equal, less-than, unsigned less-than, greater-than or equal and unsigned greater-than or equal. Ten comparison-branch operations are implemented with only six instructions, by reversing the order of operands in the [[Assembly language|assembler]]. For example, ''branch if greater than'' can be done by ''less-than'' with a reversed order of operands.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe comparing branches have a twelve-bit signed range, and jump relative to the PC.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nUnlike some RISC architectures, RISC-V does not include a [[branch delay slot]], a position after a branch instruction that can be filled with an instruction that is executed whether or not the branch is taken. RISC-V omits a branch delay slot because it complicates multicycle CPUs, superscalar CPUs, and long pipelines. Dynamic [[branch predictor]]s have succeeded well enough to reduce the need for delayed branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nOn the first encounter with a branch, RISC-V CPUs should assume that a negative relative branch (i.e. the sign bit of the offset is \"1\") will be taken.<ref name=\"isa\" /> This assumes that a backward branch is a loop, and provides a default direction so that simple pipelined CPUs can fill their pipeline of instructions. Other than this, RISC-V does not require [[branch prediction]], but core implementations are allowed to add it. RV32I reserves a \"HINT\" instruction space that presently does not contain any hints on branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Arithmetic and logic sets===\nRISC-V segregates math into a minimal set of [[integer]] instructions (set ''I'') with [[Arithmetic logic unit|add, subtract, shift, bit-wise logic]] and comparing-branches. These can simulate most of the other RISC-V instruction sets with software. (The atomic instructions are a notable exception.) RISC-V currently lacks the ''count leading zero'' and bit-field operations normally used to speed software floating-point in a pure-integer processor.\n\nThe integer multiplication instructions (set ''M'') includes signed and unsigned multiply and divide. Double-precision integer multiplies and divides are included, as multiplies and divides that produce the ''high word'' of the result. The ISA document recommends that implementors of CPUs and compilers ''fuse'' a standardized sequence of high and low multiply and divide instructions to one operation if possible.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[floating-point]] instructions (set ''F'') includes single-precision arithmetic and also comparison-branches similar to the integer arithmetic. It requires an additional set of 32 floating-point registers. These are separate from the integer registers. The double-precision floating point instructions (set ''D'') generally assume that the floating-point registers are 64-bit (i.e., double-width), and the ''F'' subset is coordinated with the ''D'' set. A quad-precision 128-bit floating-point ISA (''Q'') is also defined. RISC-V computers without floating-point can use a floating-point software library.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V does not cause [[Exception handling|exceptions]] on arithmetic errors, including [[Overflow flag|overflow]], underflow, subnormal, and divide by zero. Instead, both integer and floating-point arithmetic produce reasonable default values and set status bits. Divide-by-zero can be discovered by one branch after the division. The status bits can be tested by an operating system or periodic interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Atomic memory operations===\nRISC-V supports computers that share memory between multiple CPUs and [[Thread (computing)|threads]]. RISC-V's standard memory consistency model is [[release consistency]]. That is, loads and stores may generally be reordered, but some loads may be designated as ''acquire'' operations which must precede later memory accesses, and some stores may be designated as ''release'' operations which must follow earlier memory accesses.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe base instruction set includes minimal support in the form of a [[Fence instruction|{{code|fence}} instruction]] to enforce memory ordering. Although this is sufficient ({{code|fence r, rw}} provides ''acquire'' and {{code|fence rw, w}} provides ''release''), combined operations can be more efficient.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe atomic memory operation extension supports two types of atomic memory operations for release consistency. First, it provides general purpose [[Load-link/store-conditional|''load-reserved'' {{code|lr}} and ''store-conditional'' {{code|sc}}]] instructions. {{code|lr}} performs a load, and tries to reserve that address for its thread. A later store-conditional {{code|sc}} to the reserved address will be performed only if the reservation is not broken by an intervening store from another source. If the store succeeds, a zero is placed in a register. If it failed, a non-zero value indicates that software needs to retry the operation. In either case, the reservation is released.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe second group of atomic instructions perform [[read-modify-write]] sequences: a load (which is optionally a load-acquire) to a destination register, then an operation between the loaded value and a source register, then a store of the result (which may optionally be a store-release). Making the memory barriers optional permits combining the operations. The optional operations are enabled by ''acquire'' and ''release'' bits which are present in every atomic instruction. RISC-V defines nine possible operations: swap (use source register value directly); add; bitwise and, or, and exclusive-or; and signed and unsigned minimum and maximum.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nA system design may optimize these combined operations more than {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. For example, if the destination register for a swap is the constant zero, the load may be skipped. If the value stored is unmodified since the load, the store may be skipped.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[IBM System/370]] and its successors including [[z/Architecture]], and [[x86]], both implement a [[compare-and-swap]] ({{code|cas}}) instruction, which tests and conditionally updates a location in memory: if the location contains an expected old value, {{code|cas}} replaces it with a given new value; it then returns an indication of whether it made the change. However, a simple load-type instruction is usually performed before the {{code|cas}} to fetch the old value. The classic problem is that if a thread reads (loads) a value ''A'', calculates a new value ''C'', and then uses ({{code|cas}}) to replace ''A'' with ''C'', it has no way to know whether concurrent activity in another thread has replaced ''A'' with some other value ''B'' and then restored the ''A'' in between. In some algorithms (e.g., ones in which the values in memory are pointers to dynamically allocated blocks), this [[ABA problem]] can lead to incorrect results. The most common solution employs a ''double-wide {{code|cas}}'' instruction to update both the pointer and an adjacent counter; unfortunately, such an instruction requires a special instruction format to specify multiple registers, performs several reads and writes, and can have complex bus operation.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe {{code|lr}}/{{code|sc}} alternative is more efficient. It usually requires only one memory load, and minimizing slow memory operations is desirable. It's also exact: it controls all accesses to the memory cell, rather than just assuring a bit pattern. However, unlike {{code|cas}}, it can permit [[livelock]], in which two or more threads repeatedly cause each other's instructions to fail. RISC-V guarantees forward progress (no livelock) if the code follows rules on the timing and sequence of instructions: 1) It must use only the ''I'' subset. 2) To prevent repetitive cache misses, the code (including the retry loop) must occupy no more than 16 consecutive instructions. 3) It must include no system or fence instructions, or taken backward branches between the {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. 4) The backward branch to the retry loop must be to the original sequence.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe specification gives examples of how to use this subset to lock a data structure.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Compressed subset===\nThe standard RISC-V ISA specifies that all instructions are 32 bits. This makes for a particularly simple implementation, but like other RISC processors with such an instruction encoding, results in larger code size than in other instruction sets.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" />\nTo compensate, RISC-V's ''32-bit'' instructions are actually 30 bits; {{frac|3|4}} of the [[opcode]] space is reserved for an optional (but recommended) variable-length ''compressed'' instruction set, RVC, that includes 16-bit instructions. Like ARM's Thumb and the MIPS16, the compressed instructions are simply aliases for a subset of the larger instructions. Unlike ARM's Thumb or the MIPS compressed set, space was reserved from the beginning so there is no separate operating mode. Standard and compressed instructions may be intermixed freely.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" /> (letter ''C'')<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nBecause (like Thumb-1 and MIPS16) the compressed instructions are simply alternate encodings (aliases) for a selected subset of larger instructions, the compression can be implemented in the assembler, and it is not essential for the compiler to even know about it.\n\nA prototype of RVC was tested in 2011.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The prototype code was 20% smaller than an [[x86]] PC and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] compressed code, and 2% larger than [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Thumb-2]] code.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> It also substantially reduced both the needed cache memory and the estimated power use of the memory system.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nThe researcher intended to reduce the code's binary size for small computers, especially [[embedded computer]] systems. The prototype included 33 of the most frequently used instructions, recoded as compact 16-bit formats using operation codes previously reserved for the compressed set.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The compression was done in the [[Assembly language|assembler]], with no changes to the compiler. Compressed instructions omitted fields that are often zero, used small immediate values or accessed subsets (16 or 8) of the registers. {{code|addi}} is very common and often compressible.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nMuch of the difference in size compared to Arm's Thumb set occurred because RISC-V, and the prototype, have no instructions to save and restore multiple registers. Instead, the compiler generated conventional instructions that access the stack. The prototype RVC assembler then often converted these to compressed forms that were half the size. However, this still took more code space than the ARM instructions that save and restore multiple registers. The researcher proposed to modify the compiler to call library routines to save and restore registers. These routines would tend to remain in a code cache and thus run fast, though probably not as fast as a save-multiple instruction.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nStandard RVC requires occasional use of 32-bit instructions. Several nonstandard RVC proposals are complete, requiring no 32-bit instructions, and are said to have higher densities than standard RVC.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |last1=Brussee |first1=Rogier |title=A Complete 16-bit RVC |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SrujNcNc8RA/0mA-dATSBwAJ |website=Google Groups |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Brussee\">{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!searchin/isa-dev/16-bit/isa-dev/iK3enKGb5bw/cuVAq0J8EAAJ |title=Proposal: Xcondensed, [a] ...

Each layer also is expected to have a thin layer of standardized supporting software that communicates to a more-privileged layer, or hardware.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe overall plan for this ISA is to make the hypervisor mode [[orthogonal]] to the user and supervisor modes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SfEDPLU0NU4/WpAE_A4OBQAJ |title=Proposal for Virtualization without H mode |last=Bonzini |first=Paolo |last2=Waterman |first2=Andrew |website=Google Groups, RISC-V ISA Dev. |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> The basic feature is a configuration bit that either permits supervisor-level code to access hypervisor registers, or causes an interrupt on accesses. This bit lets supervisor mode directly handle the hardware needed by a hypervisor. This simplifies a type 2 hypervisor, hosted by an operating system. This is a popular mode to run warehouse-scale computers. To support type 1, unhosted hypervisors, the bit can cause these accesses to interrupt to a hypervisor. The bit simplifies nesting of hypervisors, in which a hypervisor runs under a hypervisor. It's also said to simplify supervisor code by letting the kernel use its own hypervisor features with its own kernel code. As a result, the hypervisor form of the ISA supports five modes: machine, supervisor, user, supervisor-under-hypervisor and user-under-hypervisor.\n\nThe privileged instruction set specification explicitly defines ''hardware [[Thread (computing)|threads]]'', or ''harts''. Multiple hardware threads are a common practice in more-capable computers. When one thread is stalled, waiting for memory, others can often proceed. Hardware threads can help make better use of the large number of registers and execution units in fast out-of-order CPUs. Finally, hardware threads can be a simple, powerful way to handle [[interrupt]]s: No saving or restoring of registers is required, simply executing a different hardware thread. However, the only hardware thread required in a RISC-V computer is thread zero.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe existing control and status register definitions support RISC-V's error and memory exceptions, and a small number of interrupts. For systems with more interrupts, the specification also defines an interrupt controller. Interrupts always start at the highest-privileged machine level, and the control registers of each level have explicit ''forwarding'' bits to route interrupts to less-privileged code. For example, the hypervisor need not include software that executes on each interrupt to forward an interrupt to an operating system. Instead, on set-up, it can set bits to forward the interrupt.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nSeveral memory systems are supported in the specification. Physical-only is suited to the simplest [[embedded system]]s. There are also three [[UNIX]]-style [[virtual memory]] systems for memory cached in mass-storage systems. The virtual memory systems have three sizes, with addresses sized 32, 39 and 48-bits. All virtual memory systems support 4&nbsp;KiB pages, multilevel page-table trees and use very similar algorithms to walk the page table trees. All are designed for either hardware or software page-table walking. To optionally reduce the cost of page table walks, super-sized pages may be leaf pages in higher levels of a system's page table tree. SV32 has a two layer page table tree and supports 4&nbsp;MiB superpages. SV39 has a three level page table, and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages and 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages. SV48 is required to support SV39. It also has a 4-level page table and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages, 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages, and 512&nbsp;GiB terapages. Superpages are aligned on the page boundaries for the next-lowest size of page.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\n===Bit manipulation===\nAn unapproved bit-manipulation (B) ISA for RISC-V was under review in January 2020.{{clarify|reason=Was under review and was accepted, was under review but was rejected, or still is under review?|date=January 2020}} Done well, a bit-manipulation subset can aid cryptographic, graphic, and mathematical operations.

The proposal lacked instruction formats and a license assignment to the foundation, but it was reviewed by the mailing list.<ref name=\"andes_simd\" /> Some unpopular parts of this proposal were that it added a condition code, the first in a RISC-V design, linked adjacent registers (also a first), and has a loop counter that could be difficult to implement in some microarchitectures.\n\nA previous, well-regarded implementation for a 64-bit CPU was PA-RISC's multimedia instructions: [[Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions]]. It increased the CPU's performance on digital signal processing tasks by 48-fold or more, enabling practical real-time video [[codec]]s in 1995.<ref name=lee64bit>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Ruby |author-link=Ruby B.

It also could move subwords to different positions. PA-RISC's MAX2 was intentionally simplified. It lacked support for 8-bit or 32-bit subwords. The 16-bit subword size was chosen to support most digital signal processing tasks. These instructions were inexpensive to design and build.\n\n===Vector set===\nThe proposed vector-processing instruction set may make the packed SIMD set obsolete. The designers hope to have enough flexibility that a CPU can implement vector instructions in a standard processor's registers. This would enable minimal implementations with similar performance to a multimedia ISA, as above. However, a true [[vector processors|vector coprocessor]] could execute the same code with higher performance.<ref name=\"vect\">{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/riscv-vector-workshop-june2015.pdf |title=RISC-V Vector Extension Proposal |last=Schmidt |first=Colin |last2=Ou |first2=Albert |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=RISC-V |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|06|29}}, the vector-processing proposal is a conservative, flexible design of a general-purpose mixed-precision [[vector processor]], suitable to execute [[compute kernel]]s. Code would port easily to CPUs with differing vector lengths, ideally without recompiling.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nIn contrast, short-vector SIMD extensions are less convenient. These are used in [[x86]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and [[PA-RISC]]. In these, a change in word-width forces a change to the instruction set to expand the vector registers (in the case of x86, from 64-bit [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] registers to 128-bit [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE), to 256-bit [[Advanced Vector Extensions]] (AVX), and [[AVX-512]]). The result is a growing instruction set, and a need to port working code to the new instructions.\n\nIn the RISC-V vector ISA, rather than fix the vector length in the architecture, an instruction ({{code|setvl}}) is available which takes a requested size and sets the vector length to the minimum of the hardware limit and the requested size. So, the RISC-V proposal is more like a [[Cray-1|Cray]]'s long-vector design or ARM's Scalable Vector Extension. That is, each vector in up to 32 vectors is the same length.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe application specifies the total vector width it requires, and the processor determines the vector length it can provide with available on-chip resources. This takes the form of an instruction ({{code|vsetcfg}}) with four immediate operands, specifying the number of vector registers of each available width needed. The total must be no more than the addressable limit of 32, but may be less if the application does not require them all. The vector length is limited by the available on-chip storage divided by the number of bytes of storage needed for each entry. (Added hardware limits may also exist, which in turn may permit SIMD-style implementations.)<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nOutside of vector loops, the application can request zero-vector registers, saving the operating system the work of preserving them on [[context switch]]es.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe vector length is not only architecturally variable, but designed to vary at run time also. To achieve this flexibility, the instruction set is likely to use variable-width data paths and variable-type operations using polymorphic overloading.<ref name=\"vect\" /> The plan is that these can reduce the size and complexity of the ISA and compiler.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nRecent experimental vector processors with variable-width data paths also show profitable increases in operations per: second (speed), area (lower cost), and watt (longer battery life).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/papers/hwacha-mvp-prism2014.pdf |title=A Case for MVPs: Mixed-Precision Vector Processors |last=Ou |first=Albert |last2=Nguyen |first2=Quan |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=UC Berkeley EECS |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike a typical modern [[graphics processing unit]], there are no plans to provide special hardware to support [[branch predication]].

The debugger will use a transport system such as Joint Test Action Group ([[JTAG]]) or Universal Serial Bus ([[USB]]) to access debug registers. A standard hardware debug interface may support either a ''standardized abstract interface'' or ''instruction feeding''.<ref name=\"debug\">{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x53gVvPrDWEYq3omqLUpJBHU594zidDvoIg42mUzHvM/edit#slide=id.p |title=RISC-V Run Control Debug |last=Bradbury |first=Alex |last2=Wallentowitz |first2=Stefan |website=Google Docs |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/debug/FDmZUk7YCNw |title=RISC-V Debug Group > poll results |last=Newsome |first=Tim |website=Google Groups, RISC-V Debug Group |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|01}}, the exact form of the ''abstract interface'' remains undefined, but proposals include a memory mapped system with standardized addresses for the registers of debug devices or a command register and a data register accessible to the communication system.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents claim that similar systems are used by [[Freescale]]'s [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM) for some CPUs, [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[OpenRISC]], and [[Aeroflex]]'s [[LEON]].<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nIn ''instruction feeding'', the CPU will process a debug exception to execute individual instructions written to a register. This may be supplemented with a data-passing register and a module to directly access the memory. Instruction feeding lets the debugger access the computer exactly as software would. It also minimizes changes in the CPU, and adapts to many types of CPU. This was said to be especially apt for RISC-V because it is designed explicitly for many types of computers. The data-passing register allows a debugger to write a data-movement loop to RAM, and then execute the loop to move data into or out of the computer at a speed near the maximum speed of the debug system's data channel.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents say that similar systems are used by [[MIPS Technologies]] [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[Intel Quark]], [[Tensilica]]'s [[Xtensa]], and for [[Freescale]] [[Power ISA]] CPUs' [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM).<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nA vendor proposed a hardware trace subsystem for standardization, donated a conforming design, and initiated a review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGooganus |title=riscv-trace-spec |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-trace-spec |website=GitHub |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dahad |first1=Nitin |title=UltraSoC Tackles RISC-V Support Challenge by Donating Trace Encoder |url=https://www.eetimes.com/ultrasoc-tackles-risc-v-support-challenge-by-donating-trace-encoder/# |website=EE Times |publisher=Aspencore |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> The proposal is for a hardware module that can trace code execution on most RV5 CPUs. To reduce the data rate, and permit simpler or less-expensive paths for the trace data, the proposal does not generate trace data that could be calculated from a binary image of the code. It sends only data that indicates \"uninferrable\" paths through the program, such as which conditional branches are taken. To reduce the data rates, branches that can be calculated, such as unconditional branches, are not traced. The proposed interface between the module and the control unit is a logic signal for each uninferrable type of instruction. Addresses and other data are to be provided in a specialized bus attached to appropriate data sources in a CPU. The data structure sent to an external trace unit is a series of short messages with the needed data. The details of the data channel are intentionally not described in the proposal, because several are likely to make sense.\n\n==Implementations==\nThe RISC-V organization maintains a list of RISC-V CPU and SoC implementations.<ref>{{cite web |title=RISC-V Cores and SoC Overview |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cores-list |publisher=RISC-V |accessdate=5 October 2019 |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Existing===\nExisting commercial implementations include:\n* [[Alibaba Group]], in July 2019 announced the 2.5&nbsp;GHz 16-core 64bit (RV64GCV) XuanTie 910 [[Out-of-order_execution#Out-of-order_processors|out-of-order]] processor, the fastest RISC-V processor to date<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html|title=China's Alibaba is making a 16-core, 2.5 GHz RISC-V processor|website=www.techspot.com|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n* [[Andes Technology|Andes Technology Corporation]], a founding member of the RISC-V Foundation<ref>{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/membership/1581/andes-technology/ |title=Andes Technology |website=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> which joined the consortium in 2016, released its first two RISC-V cores in 2017.

architecture]] (ISA) based on established [[reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under [[open source license]]s that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular [[toolchain|software tool chain]]s. \n\nRISC-V has features to increase computer speed, yet reduce cost and power use. These include a [[load\u2013store architecture]], bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, simplified standards-based floating-point, a design that is architecturally neutral, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed [[sign extension]]. Sign extension is said to often be on the critical timing path.<ref name=\"isa\" />\nThe instruction set is designed for a wide range of uses. It is variable-width and extensible so that more encoding bits can always be added. It supports three word-widths, 32, 64, and 128 bits, and a variety of subsets. The definitions of each subset vary slightly for the three word-widths. The subsets support small [[embedded system]]s, [[personal computer]]s, [[supercomputer]]s with vector processors, and warehouse-scale rack-mounted [[Parallel computing|parallel computers]]. \n\nThe instruction set space for the 128-bit stretched version of the ISA was reserved because 60 years of industry experience has shown that the most unrecoverable error in instruction set design is a lack of memory address space. {{As of|2016}}, the 128-bit ISA remains undefined intentionally, because there is yet so little practical experience with such large memory systems.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are proposals to implement variable-width instructions up to 864-bits.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolf |first1=Clifford |title=Alternative proposal for instruction length encoding |url=http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2019/rvlonginsn/proposal_1.txt |website=Cliffords Subversion Servier |publisher=Clifford Wolf |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe project began in 2010 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but many contributors are volunteers not affiliated with the university.<ref name=\"contributors\" /> Unlike other academic designs which are typically optimized only for simplicity of exposition, the designers intended that the RISC-V instruction set be useable for practical computers. \n\nAs of June 2019, version 2.2 of the user-space ISA<ref name=\"isa\" /> and version 1.11 of the privileged ISA<ref name=priv-isa/> are [[Freeze (software engineering)|frozen]], permitting software and hardware development to proceed. A debug specification is available as a draft, version 0.3.<ref name=priv-isa>{{Cite web|url=https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/|title=Privileged ISA Specification|website=RISC-V Foundation}}</ref>\n\n==Rationale==\n[[File:Yunsup Lee holding RISC V prototype chip.jpg|thumb|RISC-V processor prototype, January 2013]]\n\n[[CPU design]] requires design expertise in several specialties: electronic [[Logic gate|digital logic]], [[compiler]]s, and [[operating system]]s. To cover the costs of such a team, commercial vendors of computer designs, such as [[ARM Holdings]] and [[MIPS Technologies]] charge [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for the use of their designs, [[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/07/a-long-look-at-how-arm-licenses-chips/ |title=A long look at how ARM licenses chips: Part 1 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://semiaccurate.com/2013/08/08/how-arm-licenses-its-ip-for-production/ |title=How ARM licenses its IP for production: Part 2 |last=Demerjian |first=Chuck |date=August 8, 2013 |publisher=SemiAccurate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackster.io/news/wave-computing-closes-its-mips-open-initiative-with-immediate-effect-zero-warning-e88b0df9acd0|title=Wave Computing Closes Its MIPS Open Initiative with Immediate Effect, Zero Warning|date=2019-11-15}}</ref> They also often require [[non-disclosure agreement]]s before releasing documents that describe their designs' detailed advantages. In many cases, they never describe the reasons for their design choices.\n\nRISC-V was started to solve these problems. The goal was to make a practical ISA that was open-sourced, usable academically and in any hardware or software design without royalties.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" /> Also, the rationales for every part of the project are explained, at least broadly. The RISC-V authors are academic but have substantial experience in computer design. The RISC-V ISA is a direct development from a series of academic computer-design projects. It was originated in part to aid such projects.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nIn order to build a large, continuing community of users and therefore accumulate designs and software, the RISC-V ISA designers planned to support a wide variety of practical uses: Small, fast, and low-power real-world implementations,<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"rocketsspeed\" /> without over-architecting for a particular [[microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=sodor>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |last2=Love |first2=Eric |title=ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |url=https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor |website=GitHub Inc. |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"shakti\" /><ref name=boom>{{cite web |last=Celio |first=Christopher |title=CS 152 Laboratory Exercise 3 |url=http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs152/sp14/handouts/lab3.pdf |website=UC Berkeley |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=12 February 2015}}</ref> A need for a large base of contributors is part of the reason why RISC-V was engineered to fit so many uses.\n\nThe designers say that the instruction set is the main interface in a computer because it lies between the hardware and the software. If a good instruction set was open, available for use by all, it should dramatically reduce the cost of software by permitting far more reuse. It should also increase competition among hardware providers, who can use more resources for design and less for software support.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nThe designers assert that new principles are becoming rare in instruction set design, as the most successful designs of the last forty years have become increasingly similar. Of those that failed, most did so because their sponsoring companies failed commercially, not because the instruction sets were poor technically. So, a well-designed open instruction set designed using well-established principles should attract long-term support by many vendors.<ref name=\"isasbfree\" />\n\nRISC-V also supports the designers' academic uses. The simplicity of the integer subset permits basic student exercises. The integer subset is a simple ISA enabling software to control research machines. The variable-length ISA enables extensions for both student exercises and research.<ref name=\"isa\" /> The separated privileged instruction set permits research in operating system support, without redesigning compilers.<ref name=\"isapriv\" /> RISC-V's open intellectual property allows its designs to be published, reused, and modified.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n==History==\nThe term ''[[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]'' dates from about 1980.<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> Before this, there was some knowledge that simpler computers could be effective, but the design principles were not widely described. Simple, effective computers have always been of academic interest. Academics created the RISC instruction set [[DLX]] for the first edition of ''Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach'' in 1990. [[David Patterson (computer scientist)|David Patterson]] was an author, and later assisted RISC-V. DLX was intended for educational use; academics and hobbyists implemented it using [[field-programmable gate array]]s, but it was not a commercial success. ARM CPUs, versions 2 and earlier, had a public-domain instruction set, and it is still supported by the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), a popular free-software compiler. Three open-source [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|cores]] exist for this ISA, but they have not been manufactured.<ref name=\"amber\" /><ref name=\"arm4u\" /> [[OpenRISC]] is an open-source ISA based on DLX, with associated RISC designs. It is fully supported with GCC and [[Linux]] implementations. However, it has few commercial implementations.\n\n[[Krste Asanovi\u0107]] at the University of California, Berkeley, found many uses for an open-source computer system. In 2010, he decided to develop and publish one in a \"short, three-month project over the summer\". The plan was to help both academic and industrial users.<ref name=\"isasbfree\">{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-146.pdf |title=Instruction Sets Should be Free |last=Asanovi\u0107 |first=Krste |author-link=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=U.C. Berkeley Technical Reports |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> [[David Patterson (computer scientist)|David Patterson]] at Berkeley also aided the effort. He originally identified the properties of [[Berkeley RISC]],<ref name=\"riscstart\" /> and RISC-V is one of his long series of cooperative RISC research projects. At this stage, students inexpensively provided initial software, simulations, and CPU designs.<ref name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThe RISC-V authors and their institution originally provided the ISA documents and several CPU designs under [[BSD licenses]], which allow derivative works\u2014such as RISC-V chip designs\u2014to be either open and free, or closed and proprietary. The ISA specification itself (i.e., the encoding of the instruction set) was effectively put into the public domain when the ISA tech reports were published, though the actual tech report text (an expression of the specification) was later put under a Creative Commons license to allow it to be improved by external contributors including the RISC-V Foundation.\n\nA full history of RISC-V has been published on the RISC-V Foundation website.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Foundation===\nCommercial users require an ISA to be stable before they can utilize it in a product that might last many years. To address this issue, the RISC-V Foundation was formed to own, maintain and publish intellectual property related to RISC-V's definition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/10/03/a-new-blueprint-for-microprocessors-challenges-the-industrys-giants|title=A new blueprint for microprocessors challenges the industry's giants|date=2019-10-03|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-11-10|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> The original authors and owners have surrendered their rights to the foundation.<ref name=\"rv5_found\">{{cite web |title=RISC-V Foundation |url=https://riscv.org/risc-v-foundation/ |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=15 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2019, the RISC-V Foundation announced that it would re-locate to [[Switzerland]], citing concerns over U.S. trade regulations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-semiconductors-insight-idUSKBN1XZ16L|title=U.S.-based chip-tech group moving to Switzerland over trade curb fears|date=2019-11-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the foundation freely publishes the documents defining RISC-V and permits unrestricted utilization of the ISA for both software and hardware design.

The ISA base and its extensions are developed in a collective effort between industry, the research community and educational institutions. The base specifies instructions (and their encoding), control flow, registers (and their sizes), memory and addressing, logic (i.e., integer) manipulation, and ancillaries. The base alone can implement a simplified general-purpose computer, with full software support, including a general-purpose compiler.\n\nThe standard extensions are specified to work with all of the standard bases, and with each other without conflict.\n\nMany RISC-V computers might implement the compact extension to reduce power consumption, code size, and memory use.<ref name=\"isa\" /> There are also future plans to support [[hypervisor]]s and [[virtualization]].<ref name=\"isapriv\">\n{{cite web\n | last         = Waterman\n | first        = Andrew\n | last2        = Lee\n | first2       = Yunsup\n | last3        = Avizienas\n | first3       = Rimas\n | last4        = Patterson\n | first4       = David\n | author-link4 = David Patterson (computer scientist)\n | last5        = Asanovi\u0107\n | first5       = Krste\n | author-link5 = Krste Asanovi\u0107\n | title        = Draft Privileged ISA Specification 1.9\n | url          = https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/\n | website      = RISC-V\n | publisher    = RISC-V Foundation\n | access-date  = 30 August 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nTogether with a supervisor instruction set extension, S, an RVGC defines all instructions needed to conveniently support a general purpose [[operating system]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ ISA base and extensions\n|-\n!

A large 64-bit computer might be RV64GC; i.e., shorthand for RV64IMAFDC.\n\nA naming scheme with Zxxx for standard extensions and Yxxx for non-standard (vendor-specific) extensions has been proposed.

Except for memory access instructions, instructions address only registers.\n\nThe first integer register is a zero register, and the remainder are general-purpose registers. A store to the zero register has no effect, and a read always provides 0. Using the zero register as a placeholder makes for a simpler instruction set.\n\n{{code|move rx to ry}} becomes {{code|add r0 to rx and store in ry}}.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nControl and status registers exist, but user-mode programs can access only those used for performance measurement and floating-point management.\n\nNo instructions exist to save and restore multiple registers. Those were thought to be needless, too complex, and perhaps too slow.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Memory access===\nLike many RISC designs, RISC-V is a [[load\u2013store architecture]]: instructions address only registers, with load and store instructions conveying to and from memory.\n\nMost load and store instructions include a 12-bit offset and two register identifiers. One register is the base register. The other register is the source (for a store) or destination (for a load.)\n\nThe offset is added to a base register to get the address. Forming the address as a base register plus offset allows single instructions to access data structures. For example, if the base register points to the top of a stack, single instructions can access a subroutine's local variables in the stack. Likewise the load and store instructions can access a record-style structure or a memory-mapped I/O device. Using the constant zero register as a base address allows single instructions to access memory near address zero.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nMemory is addressed as 8-bit bytes, with words being in [[little-endian]] order.<ref name=\"isa\" /> Words, up to the register size, can be accessed with the load and store instructions.\n\nAccessed memory addresses need not be aligned to their word-width, but accesses to aligned addresses may be faster; for example, simple CPUs may implement unaligned accesses with slow software emulation driven from an alignment failure interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nLike many RISC instruction sets (and some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) instruction sets, such as [[x86]] and [[IBM System/360]] families), RISC-V lacks address-modes that write back to the registers. For example, it does not auto-increment.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V manages memory systems that are shared between CPUs or [[thread (computing)|threads]] by ensuring a thread of execution always sees its memory operations in the programmed order. But between threads and I/O devices, RISC-V is simplified: It doesn't guarantee the order of memory operations, except by specific instructions, such as {{code|fence}}.\n\nA {{code|fence}} instruction guarantees that the results of predecessor operations are visible to successor operations of other threads or I/O devices. {{code|fence}} can guarantee the order of combinations of both memory and memory-mapped I/O operations. E.g. it can separate memory read and write operations, without affecting I/O operations. Or, if a system can operate I/O devices in parallel with memory, {{code|fence}} doesn't force them to wait for each other. One CPU with one thread may decode {{code|fence}} as {{code|nop}}.\n\nRISC-V is little-endian to resemble other familiar, successful computers, for example, [[x86]]. This also reduces a CPU's complexity and costs slightly because it reads all sizes of words in the same order. For example, the RISC-V instruction set decodes starting at the lowest-addressed byte of the instruction. The specification leaves open the possibility of non-standard big-endian or bi-endian systems.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome RISC CPUs (such as [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[DLX]], and Berkeley's RISC-I) place 16 bits of offset in the loads and stores. They set the upper 16 bits by a ''load upper word'' instruction. This permits upper-halfword values to be set easily, without shifting bits. However, most use of the upper half-word instruction makes 32-bit constants, like addresses. RISC-V uses a [[SPARC]]-like combination of 12-bit offsets and 20-bit ''set upper'' instructions. The smaller 12-bit offset helps compact, 32-bit load and store instructions select two of 32 registers yet still have enough bits to support RISC-V's variable-length instruction coding.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Immediates===\nRISC-V handles 32-bit constants and addresses with instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit register. Load upper immediate {{code|lui}} loads 20 bits into bits 31 through 12. Then a second instruction such as {{code|addi}} can set the bottom 12 bits.\n\nThis method is extended to permit [[position-independent code]] by adding an instruction, {{code|auipc}} that generates 20 upper address bits by adding an offset to the program counter and storing the result into a base register. This permits a program to generate 32-bit addresses that are relative to the program counter.\n\nThe base register can often be used as-is with the 12-bit offsets of the loads and stores. If needed, {{code|addi}} can set the lower 12-bits of a register. In 64-bit and 128-bit ISAs,{{code|lui}} and {{code|auipc}} sign-extend the result to get the larger address.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nSome fast CPUs may interpret combinations of instructions as single ''fused'' instructions. {{code|lui}} or {{code|auipc}} may be good candidates to fuse with {{code|addi}}, loads or stores.\n\n===Subroutine calls, jumps, and branches===\nRISC-V's subroutine call {{code|jal}} (jump and link) places its return address in a register. This is faster in many computer designs, because it saves a memory access compared to systems that push a return address directly on a stack in memory. {{code|jal}} has a 20-bit signed (2's complement) offset. The offset is multiplied by 2, then added to the PC to generate a relative address to a 32-bit instruction. If the result is not at a 32-bit address (i.e., evenly divisible by 4), the CPU may force an [[Exception handling|exception]].<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V CPUs jump to calculated addresses using a ''jump and link-register'', {{code|jalr}} instruction. {{code|jalr}} is similar to {{code|jal}}, but gets its destination address by adding a 12-bit offset to a base register. (In contrast,{{code|jal}} adds a larger 20-bit offset to the PC.)\n\n{{code|jalr}}'s bit format is like the register-relative loads and stores. Like them, {{code|jalr}} can be used with the instructions that set the upper 20 bits of a base register to make 32-bit branches, either to an absolute address (using {{code|lui}}) or a PC-relative one (using {{code|auipc}} for [[position-independent code]]). (Using a constant zero base address allows single-instruction calls to a small (the offset), fixed positive or negative address.)\n\nRISC-V recycles {{code|jal}} and {{code|jalr}} to get unconditional 20-bit PC-relative jumps and unconditional register-based 12-bit jumps. Jumps just make the linkage register 0 so that no return address is saved.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V also recycles {{code|jalr}} to return from a subroutine: To do this, {{code|jalr}}'s base register is set to be the linkage register saved by {{code|jal}} or {{code|jalr}}. {{code|jalr}}'s offset is zero and the linkage register is zero, so that there is no offset, and no return address is saved.\n\nLike many RISC designs, in a subroutine call, a RISC-V compiler must use individual instructions to save registers to the stack at the start, and then restore these from the stack on exit. RISC-V has no ''save multiple'' or ''restore multiple'' register instructions. These were thought to make the CPU too complex, and possibly slow.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> This can take more code space. Designers planned to reduce code size with library routines to save and restore registers.<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nRISC-V has no [[condition code register]] or [[carry bit]]. The designers believed that condition codes make fast CPUs more complex by forcing interactions between instructions in different stages of execution. This choice makes multiple-precision arithmetic more complex. Also, a few numerical tasks need more energy. As a result, [[Branch predication|predication]] (the conditional execution of instructions) is not supported. The designers claim that very fast, out-of-order CPU designs do predication anyway, by doing the comparison branch and conditional code in parallel, then discarding the unused path's effects. They also claim that even in simpler CPUs, predication is less valuable than [[branch prediction]], which can prevent most stalls associated with conditional branches. Code without predication is larger, with more branches, but they also claim that a compressed instruction set (such as RISC-V's set ''C'') solves that problem in most cases.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nInstead, RISC-V has short branches that perform comparisons: equal, not-equal, less-than, unsigned less-than, greater-than or equal and unsigned greater-than or equal. Ten comparison-branch operations are implemented with only six instructions, by reversing the order of operands in the [[Assembly language|assembler]]. For example, ''branch if greater than'' can be done by ''less-than'' with a reversed order of operands.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe comparing branches have a twelve-bit signed range, and jump relative to the PC.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nUnlike some RISC architectures, RISC-V does not include a [[branch delay slot]], a position after a branch instruction that can be filled with an instruction that is executed whether or not the branch is taken. RISC-V omits a branch delay slot because it complicates multicycle CPUs, superscalar CPUs, and long pipelines. Dynamic [[branch predictor]]s have succeeded well enough to reduce the need for delayed branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nOn the first encounter with a branch, RISC-V CPUs should assume that a negative relative branch (i.e. the sign bit of the offset is \"1\") will be taken.<ref name=\"isa\" /> This assumes that a backward branch is a loop, and provides a default direction so that simple pipelined CPUs can fill their pipeline of instructions. Other than this, RISC-V does not require [[branch prediction]], but core implementations are allowed to add it. RV32I reserves a \"HINT\" instruction space that presently does not contain any hints on branches.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Arithmetic and logic sets===\nRISC-V segregates math into a minimal set of [[integer]] instructions (set ''I'') with [[Arithmetic logic unit|add, subtract, shift, bit-wise logic]] and comparing-branches. These can simulate most of the other RISC-V instruction sets with software. (The atomic instructions are a notable exception.) RISC-V currently lacks the ''count leading zero'' and bit-field operations normally used to speed software floating-point in a pure-integer processor.\n\nThe integer multiplication instructions (set ''M'') includes signed and unsigned multiply and divide. Double-precision integer multiplies and divides are included, as multiplies and divides that produce the ''high word'' of the result. The ISA document recommends that implementors of CPUs and compilers ''fuse'' a standardized sequence of high and low multiply and divide instructions to one operation if possible.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[floating-point]] instructions (set ''F'') includes single-precision arithmetic and also comparison-branches similar to the integer arithmetic. It requires an additional set of 32 floating-point registers. These are separate from the integer registers. The double-precision floating point instructions (set ''D'') generally assume that the floating-point registers are 64-bit (i.e., double-width), and the ''F'' subset is coordinated with the ''D'' set. A quad-precision 128-bit floating-point ISA (''Q'') is also defined. RISC-V computers without floating-point can use a floating-point software library.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nRISC-V does not cause [[Exception handling|exceptions]] on arithmetic errors, including [[Overflow flag|overflow]], underflow, subnormal, and divide by zero. Instead, both integer and floating-point arithmetic produce reasonable default values and set status bits. Divide-by-zero can be discovered by one branch after the division. The status bits can be tested by an operating system or periodic interrupt.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Atomic memory operations===\nRISC-V supports computers that share memory between multiple CPUs and [[Thread (computing)|threads]]. RISC-V's standard memory consistency model is [[release consistency]]. That is, loads and stores may generally be reordered, but some loads may be designated as ''acquire'' operations which must precede later memory accesses, and some stores may be designated as ''release'' operations which must follow earlier memory accesses.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe base instruction set includes minimal support in the form of a [[Fence instruction|{{code|fence}} instruction]] to enforce memory ordering. Although this is sufficient ({{code|fence r, rw}} provides ''acquire'' and {{code|fence rw, w}} provides ''release''), combined operations can be more efficient.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe atomic memory operation extension supports two types of atomic memory operations for release consistency. First, it provides general purpose [[Load-link/store-conditional|''load-reserved'' {{code|lr}} and ''store-conditional'' {{code|sc}}]] instructions. {{code|lr}} performs a load, and tries to reserve that address for its thread. A later store-conditional {{code|sc}} to the reserved address will be performed only if the reservation is not broken by an intervening store from another source. If the store succeeds, a zero is placed in a register. If it failed, a non-zero value indicates that software needs to retry the operation. In either case, the reservation is released.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe second group of atomic instructions perform [[read-modify-write]] sequences: a load (which is optionally a load-acquire) to a destination register, then an operation between the loaded value and a source register, then a store of the result (which may optionally be a store-release). Making the memory barriers optional permits combining the operations. The optional operations are enabled by ''acquire'' and ''release'' bits which are present in every atomic instruction. RISC-V defines nine possible operations: swap (use source register value directly); add; bitwise and, or, and exclusive-or; and signed and unsigned minimum and maximum.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nA system design may optimize these combined operations more than {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. For example, if the destination register for a swap is the constant zero, the load may be skipped. If the value stored is unmodified since the load, the store may be skipped.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe [[IBM System/370]] and its successors including [[z/Architecture]], and [[x86]], both implement a [[compare-and-swap]] ({{code|cas}}) instruction, which tests and conditionally updates a location in memory: if the location contains an expected old value, {{code|cas}} replaces it with a given new value; it then returns an indication of whether it made the change. However, a simple load-type instruction is usually performed before the {{code|cas}} to fetch the old value. The classic problem is that if a thread reads (loads) a value ''A'', calculates a new value ''C'', and then uses ({{code|cas}}) to replace ''A'' with ''C'', it has no way to know whether concurrent activity in another thread has replaced ''A'' with some other value ''B'' and then restored the ''A'' in between. In some algorithms (e.g., ones in which the values in memory are pointers to dynamically allocated blocks), this [[ABA problem]] can lead to incorrect results. The most common solution employs a ''double-wide {{code|cas}}'' instruction to update both the pointer and an adjacent counter; unfortunately, such an instruction requires a special instruction format to specify multiple registers, performs several reads and writes, and can have complex bus operation.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe {{code|lr}}/{{code|sc}} alternative is more efficient. It usually requires only one memory load, and minimizing slow memory operations is desirable. It's also exact: it controls all accesses to the memory cell, rather than just assuring a bit pattern. However, unlike {{code|cas}}, it can permit [[livelock]], in which two or more threads repeatedly cause each other's instructions to fail. RISC-V guarantees forward progress (no livelock) if the code follows rules on the timing and sequence of instructions: 1) It must use only the ''I'' subset. 2) To prevent repetitive cache misses, the code (including the retry loop) must occupy no more than 16 consecutive instructions. 3) It must include no system or fence instructions, or taken backward branches between the {{code|lr}} and {{code|sc}}. 4) The backward branch to the retry loop must be to the original sequence.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\nThe specification gives examples of how to use this subset to lock a data structure.<ref name=\"isa\" />\n\n===Compressed subset===\nThe standard RISC-V ISA specifies that all instructions are 32 bits. This makes for a particularly simple implementation, but like other RISC processors with such an instruction encoding, results in larger code size than in other instruction sets.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" />\nTo compensate, RISC-V's ''32-bit'' instructions are actually 30 bits; {{frac|3|4}} of the [[opcode]] space is reserved for an optional (but recommended) variable-length ''compressed'' instruction set, RVC, that includes 16-bit instructions. Like ARM's Thumb and the MIPS16, the compressed instructions are simply aliases for a subset of the larger instructions. Unlike ARM's Thumb or the MIPS compressed set, space was reserved from the beginning so there is no separate operating mode. Standard and compressed instructions may be intermixed freely.<ref name=\"isa\" /><ref name=\"riscvc\" /> (letter ''C'')<ref name=\"isacompressed\" />\n\nBecause (like Thumb-1 and MIPS16) the compressed instructions are simply alternate encodings (aliases) for a selected subset of larger instructions, the compression can be implemented in the assembler, and it is not essential for the compiler to even know about it.\n\nA prototype of RVC was tested in 2011.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The prototype code was 20% smaller than an [[x86]] PC and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] compressed code, and 2% larger than [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Thumb-2]] code.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> It also substantially reduced both the needed cache memory and the estimated power use of the memory system.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nThe researcher intended to reduce the code's binary size for small computers, especially [[embedded computer]] systems. The prototype included 33 of the most frequently used instructions, recoded as compact 16-bit formats using operation codes previously reserved for the compressed set.<ref name=\"riscvc\" /> The compression was done in the [[Assembly language|assembler]], with no changes to the compiler. Compressed instructions omitted fields that are often zero, used small immediate values or accessed subsets (16 or 8) of the registers. {{code|addi}} is very common and often compressible.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nMuch of the difference in size compared to Arm's Thumb set occurred because RISC-V, and the prototype, have no instructions to save and restore multiple registers. Instead, the compiler generated conventional instructions that access the stack. The prototype RVC assembler then often converted these to compressed forms that were half the size. However, this still took more code space than the ARM instructions that save and restore multiple registers. The researcher proposed to modify the compiler to call library routines to save and restore registers. These routines would tend to remain in a code cache and thus run fast, though probably not as fast as a save-multiple instruction.<ref name=\"riscvc\" />\n\nStandard RVC requires occasional use of 32-bit instructions. Several nonstandard RVC proposals are complete, requiring no 32-bit instructions, and are said to have higher densities than standard RVC.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |last1=Brussee |first1=Rogier |title=A Complete 16-bit RVC |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SrujNcNc8RA/0mA-dATSBwAJ |website=Google Groups |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Brussee\">{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!searchin/isa-dev/16-bit/isa-dev/iK3enKGb5bw/cuVAq0J8EAAJ |title=Proposal: Xcondensed, [a] ...

Floating-point instructions should not be supported (the specification forbids it as uneconomical), so a floating-point software library must be used.<ref name=\"isa\" /> The compressed set ''C'' is recommended. The privileged instruction set supports only machine mode, user mode and memory schemes that use base-and-bound address relocation.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nDiscussion has occurred for a microcontroller profile for RISC-V, to ease development of deeply [[embedded system]]s. It centers on faster, simple C-language support for interrupts, simplified security modes and a simplified [[POSIX]] application binary interface.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/emb-riscv/specs-markdown/blob/master/README.md |title=The RISC-V Microcontroller Profile |last=Ionescu |first=Liviu |website=Github |access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nCorrespondents have also proposed smaller, non-standard, 16-bit ''RV16E'' ISAs: Several serious proposals would use the 16-bit ''C'' instructions with 8 \u00d7 16-bit registers.<ref name=\"Brussee\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/> An April fools' joke proposed a very practical arrangement: Utilize 16 \u00d7 16-bit integer registers, with the standard ''EIMC'' ISAs (including 32-bit instructions.)

Each layer also is expected to have a thin layer of standardized supporting software that communicates to a more-privileged layer, or hardware.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe overall plan for this ISA is to make the hypervisor mode [[orthogonal]] to the user and supervisor modes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!msg/isa-dev/SfEDPLU0NU4/WpAE_A4OBQAJ |title=Proposal for Virtualization without H mode |last=Bonzini |first=Paolo |last2=Waterman |first2=Andrew |website=Google Groups, RISC-V ISA Dev. |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref> The basic feature is a configuration bit that either permits supervisor-level code to access hypervisor registers, or causes an interrupt on accesses. This bit lets supervisor mode directly handle the hardware needed by a hypervisor. This simplifies a type 2 hypervisor, hosted by an operating system. This is a popular mode to run warehouse-scale computers. To support type 1, unhosted hypervisors, the bit can cause these accesses to interrupt to a hypervisor. The bit simplifies nesting of hypervisors, in which a hypervisor runs under a hypervisor. It's also said to simplify supervisor code by letting the kernel use its own hypervisor features with its own kernel code. As a result, the hypervisor form of the ISA supports five modes: machine, supervisor, user, supervisor-under-hypervisor and user-under-hypervisor.\n\nThe privileged instruction set specification explicitly defines ''hardware [[Thread (computing)|threads]]'', or ''harts''. Multiple hardware threads are a common practice in more-capable computers. When one thread is stalled, waiting for memory, others can often proceed. Hardware threads can help make better use of the large number of registers and execution units in fast out-of-order CPUs. Finally, hardware threads can be a simple, powerful way to handle [[interrupt]]s: No saving or restoring of registers is required, simply executing a different hardware thread. However, the only hardware thread required in a RISC-V computer is thread zero.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nThe existing control and status register definitions support RISC-V's error and memory exceptions, and a small number of interrupts. For systems with more interrupts, the specification also defines an interrupt controller. Interrupts always start at the highest-privileged machine level, and the control registers of each level have explicit ''forwarding'' bits to route interrupts to less-privileged code. For example, the hypervisor need not include software that executes on each interrupt to forward an interrupt to an operating system. Instead, on set-up, it can set bits to forward the interrupt.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\nSeveral memory systems are supported in the specification. Physical-only is suited to the simplest [[embedded system]]s. There are also three [[UNIX]]-style [[virtual memory]] systems for memory cached in mass-storage systems. The virtual memory systems have three sizes, with addresses sized 32, 39 and 48-bits. All virtual memory systems support 4&nbsp;KiB pages, multilevel page-table trees and use very similar algorithms to walk the page table trees. All are designed for either hardware or software page-table walking. To optionally reduce the cost of page table walks, super-sized pages may be leaf pages in higher levels of a system's page table tree. SV32 has a two layer page table tree and supports 4&nbsp;MiB superpages. SV39 has a three level page table, and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages and 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages. SV48 is required to support SV39. It also has a 4-level page table and supports 2&nbsp;MiB superpages, 1&nbsp;GiB gigapages, and 512&nbsp;GiB terapages. Superpages are aligned on the page boundaries for the next-lowest size of page.<ref name=\"isapriv\" />\n\n===Bit manipulation===\nAn unapproved bit-manipulation (B) ISA for RISC-V was under review in January 2020.{{clarify|reason=Was under review and was accepted, was under review but was rejected, or still is under review?|date=January 2020}} Done well, a bit-manipulation subset can aid cryptographic, graphic, and mathematical operations.

The 16-bit subword size was chosen to support most digital signal processing tasks.

The designers hope to have enough flexibility that a CPU can implement vector instructions in a standard processor's registers. This would enable minimal implementations with similar performance to a multimedia ISA, as above.

In these, a change in word-width forces a change to the instruction set to expand the vector registers (in the case of x86, from 64-bit [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] registers to 128-bit [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE), to 256-bit [[Advanced Vector Extensions]] (AVX), and [[AVX-512]]). The result is a growing instruction set, and a need to port working code to the new instructions.\n\nIn the RISC-V vector ISA, rather than fix the vector length in the architecture, an instruction ({{code|setvl}}) is available which takes a requested size and sets the vector length to the minimum of the hardware limit and the requested size. So, the RISC-V proposal is more like a [[Cray-1|Cray]]'s long-vector design or ARM's Scalable Vector Extension. That is, each vector in up to 32 vectors is the same length.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe application specifies the total vector width it requires, and the processor determines the vector length it can provide with available on-chip resources. This takes the form of an instruction ({{code|vsetcfg}}) with four immediate operands, specifying the number of vector registers of each available width needed. The total must be no more than the addressable limit of 32, but may be less if the application does not require them all. The vector length is limited by the available on-chip storage divided by the number of bytes of storage needed for each entry. (Added hardware limits may also exist, which in turn may permit SIMD-style implementations.)<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nOutside of vector loops, the application can request zero-vector registers, saving the operating system the work of preserving them on [[context switch]]es.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nThe vector length is not only architecturally variable, but designed to vary at run time also. To achieve this flexibility, the instruction set is likely to use variable-width data paths and variable-type operations using polymorphic overloading.<ref name=\"vect\" /> The plan is that these can reduce the size and complexity of the ISA and compiler.<ref name=\"vect\" />\n\nRecent experimental vector processors with variable-width data paths also show profitable increases in operations per: second (speed), area (lower cost), and watt (longer battery life).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/papers/hwacha-mvp-prism2014.pdf |title=A Case for MVPs: Mixed-Precision Vector Processors |last=Ou |first=Albert |last2=Nguyen |first2=Quan |last3=Lee |first3=Yunsup |last4=Asanovi\u0107 |first4=Krste |author-link4=Krste Asanovi\u0107 |website=UC Berkeley EECS |publisher=Regents of the University of California |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike a typical modern [[graphics processing unit]], there are no plans to provide special hardware to support [[branch predication]].

The debugger will use a transport system such as Joint Test Action Group ([[JTAG]]) or Universal Serial Bus ([[USB]]) to access debug registers. A standard hardware debug interface may support either a ''standardized abstract interface'' or ''instruction feeding''.<ref name=\"debug\">{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x53gVvPrDWEYq3omqLUpJBHU594zidDvoIg42mUzHvM/edit#slide=id.p |title=RISC-V Run Control Debug |last=Bradbury |first=Alex |last2=Wallentowitz |first2=Stefan |website=Google Docs |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!topic/debug/FDmZUk7YCNw |title=RISC-V Debug Group > poll results |last=Newsome |first=Tim |website=Google Groups, RISC-V Debug Group |publisher=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2017|01}}, the exact form of the ''abstract interface'' remains undefined, but proposals include a memory mapped system with standardized addresses for the registers of debug devices or a command register and a data register accessible to the communication system.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents claim that similar systems are used by [[Freescale]]'s [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM) for some CPUs, [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[OpenRISC]], and [[Aeroflex]]'s [[LEON]].<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nIn ''instruction feeding'', the CPU will process a debug exception to execute individual instructions written to a register. This may be supplemented with a data-passing register and a module to directly access the memory. Instruction feeding lets the debugger access the computer exactly as software would. It also minimizes changes in the CPU, and adapts to many types of CPU. This was said to be especially apt for RISC-V because it is designed explicitly for many types of computers. The data-passing register allows a debugger to write a data-movement loop to RAM, and then execute the loop to move data into or out of the computer at a speed near the maximum speed of the debug system's data channel.<ref name=\"debug\" /> Correspondents say that similar systems are used by [[MIPS Technologies]] [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[Intel Quark]], [[Tensilica]]'s [[Xtensa]], and for [[Freescale]] [[Power ISA]] CPUs' [[background debug mode interface]] (BDM).<ref name=\"debug\" />\n\nA vendor proposed a hardware trace subsystem for standardization, donated a conforming design, and initiated a review.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGooganus |title=riscv-trace-spec |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-trace-spec |website=GitHub |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dahad |first1=Nitin |title=UltraSoC Tackles RISC-V Support Challenge by Donating Trace Encoder |url=https://www.eetimes.com/ultrasoc-tackles-risc-v-support-challenge-by-donating-trace-encoder/# |website=EE Times |publisher=Aspencore |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> The proposal is for a hardware module that can trace code execution on most RV5 CPUs. To reduce the data rate, and permit simpler or less-expensive paths for the trace data, the proposal does not generate trace data that could be calculated from a binary image of the code. It sends only data that indicates \"uninferrable\" paths through the program, such as which conditional branches are taken. To reduce the data rates, branches that can be calculated, such as unconditional branches, are not traced. The proposed interface between the module and the control unit is a logic signal for each uninferrable type of instruction. Addresses and other data are to be provided in a specialized bus attached to appropriate data sources in a CPU. The data structure sent to an external trace unit is a series of short messages with the needed data. The details of the data channel are intentionally not described in the proposal, because several are likely to make sense.\n\n==Implementations==\nThe RISC-V organization maintains a list of RISC-V CPU and SoC implementations.<ref>{{cite web |title=RISC-V Cores and SoC Overview |url=https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cores-list |publisher=RISC-V |accessdate=5 October 2019 |date=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Existing===\nExisting commercial implementations include:\n* [[Alibaba Group]], in July 2019 announced the 2.5&nbsp;GHz 16-core 64bit (RV64GCV) XuanTie 910 [[Out-of-order_execution#Out-of-order_processors|out-of-order]] processor, the fastest RISC-V processor to date<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html|title=China's Alibaba is making a 16-core, 2.5 GHz RISC-V processor|website=www.techspot.com|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>\n* [[Andes Technology|Andes Technology Corporation]], a founding member of the RISC-V Foundation<ref>{{cite web |url=https://riscv.org/membership/1581/andes-technology/ |title=Andes Technology |website=RISC-V Foundation |access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> which joined the consortium in 2016, released its first two RISC-V cores in 2017.

It was written by [[Mike Bullen]], directed by [[Ciaran Donnelly (director)|Ciaran Donnelly]], and was first broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) travel to [[Sydney]], Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod ([[Gary Sweet]]) suspects that Pete is only marrying her to get access to his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets [[cold feet (metaphor)|cold feet]] and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark ([[Sean Pertwee]]) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.\n\nThe episode was conceived by Mike Bullen and ''Cold Feet''{{'}}s executive producer [[Andy Harries]] in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney and decided to contrive the main plot of the fourth series so the characters would end up in Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in [[Manchester]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], England. After [[location scouting]] and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]] for the wedding scenes, [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the [[Sydney Opera House|Opera House]]. The episode was watched by nearly nine&nbsp;million people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a \"pick of the day\". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role. The episode represented the series when it won the award for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2002]].\n\n==Plot==\nAdam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) arrive in Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) hastily arranged wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison ([[Gary Sweet]]) is surprised to learn that his daughter is marrying a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fianc\u00e9 Shawn ([[Sandy Winton]]), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.\n\nRachel, who is spending most of her time in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy ([[Susannah Doyle]]). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men in order to have a child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by [[Cold Feet (series 3)#ep20|his extramarital affair]] is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt ([[Sean Pertwee]]), a man ''she'' has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.\n\nPete and Adam make up after their row and Adam goes to Jo's to collect Pete's clothes. Her regret over her breakup with Pete leads Adam to convince Rod that he should give the wedding his blessing. He follows David to a business meeting with Rod, which David has arranged as a prelude to emigrating his family to Sydney, and with David's help changes Rod's mind about Pete. Rod later meets Jo and Pete to give them his blessing, and they reconcile. On the day of the wedding, David finally reveals his plans for the family to Karen, unaware that Mark is in the apartment. Karen is surprised that David has made the plans, including finding a house for them to live in. Mark is irritated by David's attitude and reveals the affair to him. Enraged, David lashes out at Mark and the two fight. Karen angrily tells Mark to leave. Outside the hotel, Rachel goes into premature labour. Adam rushes her to hospital, where she is taken into surgery. At the wedding venue, Pete asks David to take Adam's place as best man. As Adam has the rings, David volunteers his own wedding band to Pete, and Karen does the same for Jo. Pete and Jo exchange their wedding vows and are pronounced husband and wife. After the wedding, Karen tries to approach David but he just walks away, telling her \"no more\". Later, Pete, Jo and Karen join Adam and Rachel at the hospital, where they are introduced to the baby, Matthew Sydney Williams. David flies home alone in tears.\n\n==Production==\n=== Writing ===\nThe episode was devised following a lecture given by writer [[Mike Bullen]] and executive producer [[Andy Harries]] at the [[Screen Producers Association of Australia]] conference in November 2000.<ref name=deLisle>de Lisle, Rosanna (11 December 2000). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news001211_0480_2197 Manchester six go walkabout]\".

''Interview on bonus disc of \"Cold Feet: The Complete Story\" DVD'' [DVD]. Video Collection International.</ref> Bullen and Harries already knew that actress [[Fay Ripley]] did not want to renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted \"for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go\".<ref name=Harries/> The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1.<ref name=Campbell/> As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, \"One of them [the characters], whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters.\"<ref name=deLisle/> Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country.<ref name=deLisle/><ref>Courtis, Brian (26 April 2001). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE0104262ELDJ5DACMQ Cold Feet steps south]\".

The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as \"[[shrimp on the barbie|prawns on the barbie]]\", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue.<ref name=Campbell/> Bullen told the ''[[Sun Herald]]'', \"I really wanted to go beyond '[[no worries]]' and '[[she'll be right mate]]'. We've asked most of the local actors to improvise with their own sayings, to make sure we get it right.\"<ref name=Sams/> In 2003, Bullen recalled this episode's script as the most difficult he had ever written.<ref name=Bullen>Bullen, Mike (22 February 2003). \"And they all lived happily ever after...\". ''Western Mail'' (Western Mail & Echo): p.&nbsp;4.</ref> The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing.<ref name=Harries/> After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the ''Sun Herald'' that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet.<ref name=Sams>Sams, Christine (7 October 2001). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news011009_0472_8800 TV's coolest Brits warm their feet in Aussie sand]\". ''Herald Sun'' (The Herald and Weekly Times): p.&nbsp;45.</ref> Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of ''Cold Feet''; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles.

It was written by [[Mike Bullen]], directed by [[Ciaran Donnelly (director)|Ciaran Donnelly]], and was first broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) travel to [[Sydney]], Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod ([[Gary Sweet]]) suspects that Pete is only marrying her to get access to his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets [[cold feet (metaphor)|cold feet]] and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark ([[Sean Pertwee]]) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.\n\nThe episode was conceived by Mike Bullen and ''Cold Feet''{{'}}s executive producer [[Andy Harries]] in 2000. Both attended a television conference in Sydney and decided to contrive the main plot of the fourth series so the characters would end up in Australia. Helen Baxendale was pregnant and could not fly to Australia, so all scenes featuring Rachel were filmed in [[Manchester]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], England. After [[location scouting]] and casting around the Sydney area in May and July, production in Australia ran for 18 days in October 2001. Locations used included a heritage home in [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]] for the wedding scenes, [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] for a beach barbecue scene, and outside the [[Sydney Opera House|Opera House]]. The episode was watched by nearly nine&nbsp;million people on its original UK broadcast and received a mixed reaction from newspaper critics; some believed the trip to Sydney was an unnecessary jaunt for the cast and crew, others selected the episode as a \"pick of the day\". It also received mixed reviews in Australia and New Zealand. Kimberley Joseph's performance was praised, as was Gary Sweet's guest role. The episode represented the series when it won the award for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2002]].\n\n==Plot==\nAdam and Rachel ([[James Nesbitt]] and [[Helen Baxendale]]), and Karen and David ([[Hermione Norris]] and [[Robert Bathurst]]) arrive in Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's ([[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] and [[Kimberley Joseph]]) hastily arranged wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison ([[Gary Sweet]]) is surprised to learn that his daughter is marrying a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead for the wrong reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fianc\u00e9 Shawn ([[Sandy Winton]]), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.\n\nRachel, who is spending most of her time in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy ([[Susannah Doyle]]). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men in order to have a child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by [[Cold Feet (series 3)#ep20|his extramarital affair]] is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt ([[Sean Pertwee]]), a man ''she'' has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.\n\nPete and Adam make up after their row and Adam goes to Jo's to collect Pete's clothes. Her regret over her breakup with Pete leads Adam to convince Rod that he should give the wedding his blessing. He follows David to a business meeting with Rod, which David has arranged as a prelude to emigrating his family to Sydney, and with David's help changes Rod's mind about Pete. Rod later meets Jo and Pete to give them his blessing, and they reconcile. On the day of the wedding, David finally reveals his plans for the family to Karen, unaware that Mark is in the apartment. Karen is surprised that David has made the plans, including finding a house for them to live in. Mark is irritated by David's attitude and reveals the affair to him. Enraged, David lashes out at Mark and the two fight. Karen angrily tells Mark to leave. Outside the hotel, Rachel goes into premature labour. Adam rushes her to hospital, where she is taken into surgery. At the wedding venue, Pete asks David to take Adam's place as best man. As Adam has the rings, David volunteers his own wedding band to Pete, and Karen does the same for Jo. Pete and Jo exchange their wedding vows and are pronounced husband and wife. After the wedding, Karen tries to approach David but he just walks away, telling her \"no more\". Later, Pete, Jo and Karen join Adam and Rachel at the hospital, where they are introduced to the baby, Matthew Sydney Williams. David flies home alone in tears.\n\n==Production==\n=== Writing ===\nThe episode was devised following a lecture given by writer [[Mike Bullen]] and executive producer [[Andy Harries]] at the [[Screen Producers Association of Australia]] conference in November 2000.<ref name=deLisle>de Lisle, Rosanna (11 December 2000). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news001211_0480_2197 Manchester six go walkabout]\".

The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted \"for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go\".<ref name=Harries/> The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1.<ref name=Campbell/> As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, \"One of them [the characters], whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters.\"<ref name=deLisle/> Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country.<ref name=deLisle/><ref>Courtis, Brian (26 April 2001). \"[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE0104262ELDJ5DACMQ Cold Feet steps south]\".
