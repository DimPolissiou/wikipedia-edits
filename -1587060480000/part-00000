When Gempp became a general, he was promoted out of the job as chief, to be followed by Major G\u00fcnther Schwantes, whose term as the organization's leader was also brief.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=224\u2013225}} Many members of the ''Reichswehr'' (a significant portion of them Prussian) declined when asked to consider intelligence work, since for them, it was outside the realm of actual military service and the act of spying clashed with their Prussian military sensibilities of always showing themselves direct, loyal, and sincere.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=44}} By the 1920s, the slowly growing ''Abwehr'' was organised into three sections:\n\n{{ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|[[Reconnaissance]]\n|[[Cipher]] and Radio Monitoring\n|[[Counterintelligence|Counterespionage]]}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' intelligence staff merged with the ''Abwehr'' in 1928.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=225}} While the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from engaging in any form of espionage or spying, during the Nazi era the ''Abwehr'' disregarded this prohibition, as they saw it as hypocritical.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=573}}\n\nIn the 1930s, with the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement, the Ministry of Defence was reorganised; surprisingly, on 7 June 1932, a naval officer, Captain Konrad Patzig, was named chief of the ''Abwehr'', despite the fact that it was staffed largely by army officers.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=93}} Proving himself quite a capable chief, Patzig swiftly assured the military of his intentions and worked to earn their respect; he established good connections with the Lithuanian clandestine service against the Soviets, forged relations with other foreign agencies\u2014except for Italy, whose cipher he distrusted.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=94}} His successes did not stop the other branches of the military services from developing their own intelligence staffs.\n\nAfter the Nazis seized power, the ''Abwehr'' began sponsoring reconnaissance flights across the border with [[Poland]], under the direction of Patzig, but this led to confrontations with [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Army leaders also feared that the flights would endanger the secret plans for an attack on Poland. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the termination of the overflights in 1934 after he signed a [[German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact|nonaggression treaty with Poland]] since these reconnaissance missions might be discovered and jeopardize the treaty.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=96}} Patzig was fired in January 1935 as a result, and sent to command the new [[Deutschland-class cruiser|pocket battleship]] [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']]; he later became Chief of Naval Personnel. His replacement was another ''Reichsmarine'' captain, [[Wilhelm Canaris]].{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=97\u201399}}\n\n==Under Canaris==\n\n===Before World War II===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-013-43, Wilhelm Canaris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm Canaris]]]]\n\nBefore he took over the ''Abwehr'' on 1 January 1935, the soon-to-be Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris|Canaris]] was warned by Patzig of attempts by Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to take over all German intelligence organizations.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=96\u201399}} Heydrich, who headed the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) from 1931, had a negative attitude towards the ''Abwehr''\u2014shaped in part by his belief that Germany's defeat in the First World War was primarily attributable to failures of military intelligence,{{efn|A view Heydrich acquired from Walter Nicolai's 1923 book, ''Geheime M\u00e4chte'', in which the author argues that Imperial Germany lost the war as a result of not having a capable intelligence agency comparable to the ones operated by Britain and France.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=84}} }} and by his ambitions to control all political intelligence-gathering for Germany.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=85}}\n\nCanaris, a master of backroom dealings, thought he knew how to deal with Heydrich and Himmler. Though he tried to maintain a cordial relationship with them, the antagonism between the ''Abwehr'' and the SS did not stop when Canaris took over. Not only was competition with Heydrich and Himmler's intelligence operations a hindrance, so too were the redundant attempts by multiple organizations to control [[communications intelligence]] (COMINT) for the Reich. For instance, Canaris's Abwehr controlled the Armed Forces Deciphering operation, while the navy maintained its own listening service, known as the ''B-Dienst''. Further complicating COMINT matters, the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] also had its own communications security branch, the ''[[Pers Z S]]''.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=86}}\n\nMatters came to a head in 1937 when Hitler decided to help [[Joseph Stalin]] in the latter's [[Great Purge|purge]] of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]].  Hitler ordered that the German Army staff should be kept in the dark about Stalin's intentions, for fear that they would warn their Soviet counterparts due to their [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941#Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany|long-standing relations]]. Accordingly, special SS teams, accompanied by burglary experts from the [[Kriminalpolizei|criminal police]], broke into the secret files of the General Staff and the ''Abwehr'' and removed documents related to German-Soviet collaboration. To conceal the thefts, fires were started at the break-ins, which included ''Abwehr'' headquarters.{{sfn|Schellenberg|2000|pp=25\u201327}}\n\n===Canaris to Spain===\nUnaware that Canaris would eventually try to subvert his plans, Hitler sent him as a special envoy to Madrid during the early summer of 1940 to convince Spain to join in the coming fight against the Allies, for which Gibraltar could have strategic military value.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Instead of convincing [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] to assist the Nazi regime, Canaris advised him to stay out of the fight since he was certain the war was going to end in disaster for Germany.{{sfn|Goerlitz|1985|p=384}} Thus, instead of helping the Nazis elicit allies to their side, the ''Abwehr'' (by way of Canaris and others) was covertly undermining the regime under which they served.\n\n===1938 reorganisation===\nBefore the reorganization of the OKW in 1938, the ''Abwehr'' was merely a department within the ''Reichswehrministerium'' (Ministry of Armed Forces), and it was not until after Canaris was appointed chief that its numbers increased and it gained some independence.{{sfn|Blandford|2001|p=18}} Experiencing an explosion in personnel of sorts, the ''Abwehr'' went from fewer than 150 employees to nearly one-thousand between 1935 and 1937.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=114}} Canaris reorganized the agency in 1938, subdividing the ''Abwehr'' into three main sections:\n\n*'''The Central Division''' (also called Department Z\u2014''\"Abteilung Z\"'' or ''\"die Zentrale\"'' in German): acted as the controlling brain for the other two sections, as well as handling personnel and financial matters, including the payment of agents.  Throughout Canaris's tenure it was headed by ''Generalmajor'' [[Hans Oster]].\n*'''The Foreign Branch''', (''\"Amtsgruppe Ausland\"'' in German) (later known as '''Foreign Intelligence Group''') was the second subdivision of the Abwehr and had several functions:\n*#liaison with the OKW and the general staffs of the services,\n*#coordination with the German Foreign Ministry on military matters, and\n*#evaluation of captured documents and evaluation of foreign press and radio broadcasts.  This liaison with the OKW meant that the Foreign Branch was the appropriate channel to request ''Abwehr'' support for a particular mission.\n*'''Abwehr''' constituted the third division and was labeled \"counter-intelligence branches\" but in reality focused on intelligence gathering.  It was subdivided into the following areas and responsibilities:\n**'''I.''' Foreign Intelligence Collection (further subdivided by letter, e.g. ''Abwehr'' I-Ht)\n**: '''G''': false documents, photos, inks, passports, chemicals\n**: '''H West''': army west (Anglo-American Army intelligence)\n**: '''[[Foreign Armies East|H Ost]]''': army east (Soviet Army intelligence)\n**: '''Ht''': technical army intelligence\n**: '''I''': communications\u2014design of wireless sets, wireless operators\n**: '''K''': computer/cryptanalysis operations\n**: '''L''': air intelligence\n**: '''M''': naval intelligence\n**: '''T/lw''': technical air intelligence\n**: '''Wi''': economic intelligence\n**: Attached to ''Abwehr'' I. was Gruppe I-T for technical intelligence. Initially ''Abwehr'' I-K was a technical research unit, a small fraction the size of its British counterpart, Britain's [[Bletchley Park]]. Its importance later grew during the war to match its British counterpart in size and capability.\n**'''II.''' [[Sabotage]]: tasked with directing covert contact / exploitation of discontented minority groups in foreign countries for intelligence purposes.\n**:Attached to ''Abwehr'' II. was the [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburg Regiment]], an offshoot of Gruppe II-T (Technical Intelligence), and unconnected to any other branch outside of ''Abwehr'' II. Gruppe II-T.{{efn|Sometimes referred to as the 'Brandenburgers' of 'Brandenburger Regiment', the Brandenburg Regiment were the first German [[special forces]] unit similar to the British Commandos.}}\n**'''III.''' [[Counter-intelligence]] division: responsible for counter-intelligence operations in German industry, planting false information, penetration of foreign intelligence services and investigating acts of sabotage on German soil.  Attached to ''Abwehr'' III. were:\n::: '''IIIC''': Civilian Authority bureau\n::: '''IIIC-2''': Espionage cases bureau\n::: '''IIID''': Disinformation bureau\n::: '''IIIF''': Counter espionage agents bureau\n::: '''IIIN''': Postal bureau\n\n''Abwehr'' liaisons were also established with the army, navy and Luftwaffe High Commands, and these liaisons would pass on specific intelligence requests to the operational sections of the ''Abwehr''.\n\n''Abwehr'' I was commanded by Colonel Hans Pieckenbrock,{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=236}} ''Abwehr'' II was commanded by Colonel [[Erwin von Lahousen]] and ''Abwehr'' III was commanded by Colonel Egbert Bentivegni. These three officers formed the core of the Abwehr.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=115}}\n\n===''Ast / Abwehrstelle''===\nUnder the structure outlined above, the ''Abwehr'' placed a local station in each military district in Germany, (''\"Wehrkreis\"''), called ''''Abwehrstelle'''' or ''''Ast''''.  Following the German Table of Organisation and Equipment{{efn|TO&E being the exact listing of what was deemed necessary for any German military unit to be at full operational strength. An exception to this TO&E directive existed in Hamburg which had no permanent ''Abwehr'' II presence.}} model of ''Abwehr'' headquarters, each ''Ast'' was usually subdivided into sections for\n\n{{ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|espionage\n|sabotage\n|counter-intelligence}}\n\nTypically each ''Ast'' would be commanded by a senior army or naval officer and would be answerable to ''Abwehr'' HQ. in Berlin.  Operations carried out by each ''Ast'' would be in tandem with the overall strategic plan formulated by Admiral Canaris.  Canaris in turn would receive instructions on what intelligence gathering should take priority from the OKW or, increasingly after 1941, Hitler directly. In practice, each ''Ast'' was given considerable latitude in mission planning and execution\u2014a facet of the organisation which ultimately damaged its intelligence gathering capability.\n\nEach local ''Ast'' could recruit potential agents for missions and the ''Abwehr'' also employed freelance recruiters to groom and vet potential agents.  In most cases, the agents were recruited civilians, not officers/soldiers from the military.  The recruitment emphasis seems to have been very much on \"quantity\" not \"quality\".  The poor quality of recruits often led to the failure of ''Abwehr'' missions.{{efn|Evidence of the ''Abwehr's'' substandard performance related to recruiting is mentioned in once classified American military documents.

Such postings were referred to as \"War Organisations\" (''\"Kriegsorganisationen\"'' or ''\"KO's\"'' in German).{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=243}}  In neutral but friendly [[Spain]] for example, the ''Abwehr'' had both an ''Ast'' and a KO while [[Ireland]] had neither.  In friendly countries of interest, occupied countries, or in Germany, the intelligence service would normally organise \"Abwehr sub-stations\" (''\"Abwehrleitstellen\"'' in German or ''\"Alsts\"'' in German), or \"Abwehr adjoining posts\" (''\"Abwehrnebenstellen\"'' in German).  The ''\"Alsts\"'' would fall under the jurisdiction of the geographically appropriate ''Ast'', which in turn would be supervised by the Central division in Berlin. For a while, the KOs were tolerated by the neutral countries and those who feared Germany too much to protest but as the Allied powers waged war against Germany, many of the KOs were simply expelled at the host countries request\u2014due at least in part to pressure from the Allies.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=243\u2013248}}\n\n===Canaris and ''Die Schwarze Kapelle''===\nWhen the ''Abwehr'' was reorganized, Canaris took care to surround himself with a hand-picked staff, notably his second-in-command, Hans Oster and Section II Chief, [[Erwin Lahousen|Erwin von Lahousen]]. None were members of the Nazi Party except one. The exception was [[Rudolf Bamler]], who was appointed chief of Section III by Canaris to gain the trust of Himmler.  Canaris kept Bamler on a short leash and restricted his access to operational information.  Canaris had good reason to do this because, unknown to the High Command and Hitler, he had peppered his chief operational and administrative staff with men more loyal to him than to the Nazi Government.  While outwardly Canaris appeared to be the model of intelligence-gathering efficiency, evidence exists that he secretly opposed, and actively worked against the wishes of Hitler.  Canaris, Oster and the Chiefs of ''Abwehr'' sections I and II were all heavily involved in what the SD later dubbed \"[[Black Orchestra|The Black Orchestra]]\" (''\"Die Schwarze Kapelle\"'' in German), a plot to overthrow the Nazi regime from the inside.{{efn|The Black Orchestra being distinct from \"[[Red Orchestra (spy)|The Red Orchestra]]\" (''\"Die Rote Kapelle\"'' in German)- a largely communist organised plot to overthrow the Nazi Regime from the inside. See: ''Penguin Dictionary of the Third Reich'', London, 1997 for a listing of ''Abwehr'' officers involved in both.}}  Canaris's operational decisions, his choice of appointments and their decisions, and \u2013 crucially for the [[Third Reich]] \u2013 the input each plotter had into ''Abwehr'' operations, were all tainted by these secret dealings.{{efn|For more on the significance of the Canaris circle and how their actions were shaped in this regard, see: Olav Herfeldt's, ''Schwarze Kapelle. Spionage und Widerstand. Die Geschichte der Widerstansgruppe um Admiral Wilhelm Canaris''. Augsburg: Weltbild, 1990. {{ISBN|978-3-89350-077-2}} }}\n\n====Early Abwehr intrigue====\nBefore the war began, the ''Abwehr'' was fairly active and effective as it built a wide range of contacts; they developed links with the Ukrainians opposed to the Soviet regime, conducted meetings with Indian nationalists who were trying to free themselves from British imperialism, and established an information-sharing agreement with the Japanese.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|pp=64\u201366}} There was even some significant penetration into the extent of the United States industrial capacity and economic potential,{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=85\u201388}} and data was collected by the ''Abwehr'' concerning American military capacity and contingency planning.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|p=98}}\n\nSometime in March 1937, senior ''Abwehr'' officer [[Paul Th\u00fcmmel]] provided a vast array of significant information about the German intelligence services to Czech agents who in turn, forwarded the data to [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] London. Th\u00fcmmel also delivered details over \"military capabilities, and intentions\" as well as \"detailed information on the organization and structure of the ''Abwehr'' and SD along with \"the near-complete order of battle of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, and German mobilization plans\"; and, later \"he gave advanced warnings of the German annexation of the Sudetenland as well as the invasions of [[Czechoslovakia]] and Poland.\"{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=84}}\n\nAfter assumption of absolute control over the OKW in February 1938, Hitler declared that he did not want men of intelligence under his command, but men of brutality, an observation which did not sit well with Canaris.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=142\u2013143}} Whether he was deeply troubled by Hitler's comment or not, Canaris and the ''Abwehr'' still busied themselves preparing the ideological groundwork for the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] which occurred in March 1938.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nA month later, Canaris and the ''Abwehr'' were set to work subverting the Czechs as part of Hitler's strategy to acquire the [[Sudetenland]].{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=118\u2013119}} Before the spring of 1938 came to an end, the conservative members of the German Foreign Office and many ranking officers in the military began sharing their fears over an impending international disaster and the threat of another catastrophic European war based on Hitler's actions. A conspiratorial group formed around General [[Erwin von Witzleben]] and Admiral Canaris as a result.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1973|pp=70\u201371}} Throughout the process, Canaris and subordinates such as [[Helmuth Groscurth]] worked to prevent war to the extent feasible. Meanwhile, Canaris participated in the plots among the military leadership for a coup against Hitler and attempted to open up covert communication lines with the British, convinced that Hitler would push Europe to war.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=147\u2013164}}  Before the actual invasion of Poland occurred, the ''Abwehr'' went so far as to send a special emissary, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, to London in order to warn them.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=585}} Subverting the Nazi government with warnings to the Allies was but one part of the picture, as this move did not stop or deter Canaris from obeying Hitler's orders to provide 150 Polish army uniforms and small arms to Himmler and Heydrich for their [[Gleiwitz incident|staged attack on a German radio station by 'Polish' forces]]; one act which Hitler used to justify his assault on Poland.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=518}}\n\nIn December 1940, Hitler again sent Canaris to Spain to conclude an agreement (through strong coercion if necessary) with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] for Spanish support in the war against the Allies, but instead of prompting the Spaniard to acquiesce to Hitler's desire, Canaris reported that Franco would not commit Spanish forces until England collapsed.{{sfn|Rich|1973|pp=173\u2013174}} Conversations from this period between Franco and Admiral Canaris remain a mystery since none were recorded, but the Spanish government later expressed gratitude to the widow of Canaris at the conclusion of the Second World War by paying her a pension.{{sfn|Rich|1973|p=174}}\n\n==During World War II==\n\n===Early successes===\nUnder Canaris, the ''Abwehr'' expanded and proved to be efficient during the early years of the war. Its most notable success was [[Operation Nordpol]], which was an operation against the Dutch underground network, which at the time was supported by the [[Special Operations Executive]].{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=176\u2013177}} Concomitant to the period known as the [[Phoney War]], the ''Abwehr'' collected information on Denmark and Norway. Shipping in and out of Danish and Norwegian ports was placed under observation and over 150,000 tons of shipping was destroyed as a result. Agents in Norway and Denmark successfully penetrated their military thoroughly enough to determine the disposition and strength of land forces in both countries and deep-cover ''Abwehr'' operatives kept the German forces, particularly the Luftwaffe, intimately informed during the invasion of Norway. Against both of these nations, the ''Abwehr'' mounted what one would call a successful intelligence operation of some scale and proved itself critical to the success of German military endeavors there.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|pp=81\u201386}}\n\nFear over the drastically low levels of available petroleum at the beginning of 1940 prompted activity from the German Foreign Office and the ''Abwehr'' in an attempt to ameliorate the problem \"by concluding an unprecedented arms-for-oil\" deal, brokered so as to push back the \"Anglo-French dominance in the Ploie\u0219ti oilfield.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=381}} ''Abwehr'' operatives also played on Romanian fears, making them more amenable to Hitler's offer to shield them from the Soviets\u2014through which the Germans acquired cheap oil.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=381\u2013382}} In this regard, the ''Abwehr'' provided some semblance of economic utility for the Nazi regime.\n\nIn March 1941, the Germans forced a captured SOE radio operator to transmit messages to Britain in a code that the Germans had obtained. Even though the operator gave indications that he was compromised, the receiver in Britain did not notice. Thus the Germans were able to penetrate the Dutch operation and maintained this state of affairs for two years, capturing agents, and sending false intelligence and [[sabotage]] reports until the British caught on. In ''Bodyguard of Lies'' Anthony Brown suggests that the British were well aware that the radios were compromised and used this method to feed false information to the Germans regarding the site of the D-Day landings.{{sfn|Brown|1975|pp=464\u2013466}}\n\n===Underestimating the enemy and the Commissar Order===\nInitial estimates of the Soviet [[Red Army]]'s will and capability were low, a line of thinking shared by the Nazi hierarchy. A great deal has been made by historians over this fact, but some of the German General Staff's optimism was the result of estimates provided by the ''Abwehr'', whose assessments left the German General Staff believing that the Red Army only possessed ninety infantry divisions, twenty-three cavalry divisions, and a mere twenty-eight mechanized brigades.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|p=282}} By the time the reappraisal of the Red Army by German military intelligence occurred in mid-June 1941 (which was about 25 percent higher than previously reported), it was a foregone conclusion that Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union was going to take place.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|p=283}}\n\nLate assessments from the ''Abwehr'' contributed to military overconfidence and their reporting mechanism said nothing of the massive mobilization capability of the Soviet Union, an oversight that arguably contributed to the German defeat since time-tables were so important for German success. The German Army's failure to reach its objectives in short order proved pivotal; once winter came, improperly outfitted German forces suffered when supplies did not reach them.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|pp=283\u2013284}}{{efn|It is doubtful that more accurate reporting would have deterred Hitler since at one point during the planning phase of Operation Barbarossa, General [[Georg Thomas]], then head of the Defence Economy and Armament Office of the OKW, was scolded and patronized when he warned of insufficient fuel reserves for the attack, and voiced complaints about logistics due to the different gauges between German and Russian railways. See: Barnett (2003). ''Hitler's Generals'', p. 115.}}{{efn|Postwar historical analysis garnered from interviews with surviving members of the German General Staff make it appear as if they were completely informed and aware of the Soviet Union's true potential and fighting capacity.{{sfn|Goerlitz|1985|pp=387\u2013395}} Other sources seem to refute these claims as mere attempts to save face by the defeated German generals. For example, historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the common view among Germans was that the war with the Soviet Union would be quick and easy, and adds further evidence about the lack of any specialized weapon development for the coming conflict with the Red Army. Only after the Germans faced the T-34 did they modify and develop their tanks.{{sfn|Weinberg|1996|pp=155\u2013156}} }} Overestimating their capabilities and trusting their own assessments too much, as well as underestimating their enemies (especially the Soviets and the Americans),{{efn|When General Franz Halder informed Hitler in 1942 that the Russian factories were producing between 600-700 tanks per month, Hitler flew into a rage and refused to believe that such quantities were possible. See: Liddel-Hart (1979). ''The German Generals Talk'', p. 195.}} atop long-standing traditions of unconditional obedience, comprised a historically central weakness in the German system, according to historian Klaus Fischer.{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=445}}\n\nOn 8 September 1941, under the auspices of the [[Commissar Order]] (''Kommissarbefehl'') the OKW issued a decree concerning the ruthless ideological imperatives of the Nazi state against all semblance of Bolshevism, a provision that included executing Soviet [[commissar]]s and prisoners of war.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1968|pp=523\u2013525}} Admiral Canaris, the head of the ''OKW Ausland/Abwehr'', immediately expressed concern about the military and political ramifications of this order. Killing soldiers and even non-combatants in contravention of the [[Geneva Convention]] was not something the ''Abwehr'' leadership\u2014namely Canaris\u2014supported.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=223}}\n\n===North Africa and the Middle East===\nThe ''Abwehr'' was active in North Africa leading up to and during the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of 1941-42. North Africa, like other cases, proved disastrous for the ''Abwehr''.  The greatest failure occurred as a result of deception operations conducted by the British.  An Italian of Jewish ancestry was recruited in France sometime in 1940 by the ''Abwehr''. Unknown to the Germans, this individual was an agent codenamed \"Cheese\" who was already working for the British SIS before the war began. In February 1941, the ''Abwehr'' sent Cheese to Egypt to report on any British military operations; instead of providing his German handlers with accurate information, he passed strategic deception materials and hundreds of MI5 doctored messages to Nazi intelligence by way of a fictitious sub-agent named \u2018Paul Nicosoff\u2019, helping to ensure the success of [[Operation Torch]].{{sfn|Walton|2013|p=41}} Confirmation of this fact came when one of Hitler's most trusted military advisers, Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, General [[Alfred Jodl]], later informed his Allied interrogators that the Allied landings in North Africa came as a total surprise to the German general staff.{{sfn|Holt|2004|pp=218, 270}}{{efn|During the spring of 1941, the ''Abwehr'' dispatched a Palestine-born Jew named Ernst Paul Fackenheim (who had been in a concentration camp) back to his place of birth to apprise the Germans over British efforts to prevent General [[Erwin Rommel]] from seizing the Suez Canal. Instead of reporting information back to the Nazis, Fackenheim, who had been dropped by parachute into Palestine, promptly turned himself over to the Allies.{{sfn|Walton|2013|pp=48\u201349}} }}\n\nThe need for upwards of 500 more agents to supplement intelligence operations in North Africa prompted the ''Abwehr'' to get creative. Arab prisoners of war (POWs) languishing in French camps were offered a trip back to their homeland if they agreed to spy for the Germans in North Africa, as were Soviet POWs in the east.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=273}} Other intelligence collection efforts included working closely with the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' on aerial reconnaissance missions over North Africa. Previously, aerial reconnaissance was ordered by army intelligence officers of the Army Group HQ (part of the structure to which the ''Abwehr'' was assigned).{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=125\u2013130}} Major Witilo von Griesheim was sent to (Italian) Libya in early 1941 to set up AST Tripoli (code name WIDO). He soon set up a network of agents and wireless stations gathering information in Libya and in the surrounding French territories. In mid-July 1941, Admiral Canaris ordered ''Luftwaffe'' Major Nikolaus Ritter of ''Abwehr'' I to form a unit to infiltrate Egypt through the desert to make contact with the Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, el Masri Pasha, but this effort repeatedly failed.{{sfn|Molinari|2013|p=48}} Accompanying Ritter in Libya was the Hungarian [[desert exploration|desert explorer]] [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] with a mission to gather intelligence from British-occupied [[Egypt]]. After Ritter was injured and sent away, Alm\u00e1sy took over command, and organised the 1942 [[Operation Salaam|Operation Salam]], which succeeded in transporting two German agents across the [[Libyan Desert]] behind enemy lines to Egypt. In July 1942, Alm\u00e1sy and his agents were captured by British counterintelligence operatives.{{efn|One of the men taken into British custody (recruited to assist in communicating information between Egypt and Berlin) was a young Egyptian signals intelligence officer named [[Anwar Sadat]] (later President of Egypt).{{sfn|Walton|2013|p=50}} }}\n\nOther operations in North Africa were occurring concomitantly with those of Alm\u00e1sy and Ritter. During late January 1942 for instance, the OKW authorized the creation of a special unit, ''Sonderkommando Dora'', which was placed under the command of ''Abwehr'' officer, Oberstleutnant Walter Eichler (formerly a Panzer officer as well).{{sfn|Molinari|2013|p=48}}  The unit included geologists, cartographers, and mineralogists, who were sent into North Africa to study desert topography and assess the terrain for military use, but by November 1942\u2014following the Axis retreat from [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]\u2014''Sonderkommando Dora'' along with the [[Brandenburgers]] operating in the area, were withdrawn from the Sahara altogether.{{sfn|Molinari|2013|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nAn Iranian national recruited in Hamburg by the ''Abwehr'' before the war was converted into a double agent by British and Russian intelligence officers (working together in one of the few joint intelligence efforts of the war), who code-named him \"Kiss\". From late 1944 until the end of the war, Kiss, who was based out of the intelligence center in Baghdad, provided false information on Soviet and British troop movements in Iraq and Iran to the ''Abwehr''; as directed by his Allied controllers.{{sfn|Walton|2013|p=70}} On the Afghan border, the ''Abwehr'' sought to turn the [[Faqir of Ipi]] against British forces. They infiltrated the region using Manfred Oberdorffer, a physician, and [[Fred Hermann Brandt]], an entomologist under the guise of a medical mission to conduct research on leprosy.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\n===Questionable commitment and recruiting===\nJust how committed to German victory were typical members of the ''Abwehr'' is difficult to assess, but if its leadership tells a story, it is not one of conviction. For instance, during March 1942 when many Germans still had confidence in their F\u00fchrer and their army, Canaris saw things differently and told General [[Friedrich Fromm]] that there was no way Germany could win the war.{{efn|Diary of the Chief of Staff, Befehlhabers des Ersatzheeres, 20 March 1942, Imperial War Museum, MI 14/981/3.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=298}} }}\n\nCanaris had made the United States a primary target even before its entry into the conflict. By 1942, German agents were operating from within all of America's top armaments manufacturers. The ''Abwehr'' also suffered a very public debacle in [[Operation Pastorius]], which resulted in the executions of six ''Abwehr'' agents sent to the United States to sabotage the American aluminum industry. The ''Abwehr'' attempted use coercion as a means to infiltrate the United States when they 'recruited' a naturalized American citizen visiting Germany, William G. Sebold, by Gestapo threats and blackmail, code-naming him TRAMP, and assigning him the task of \"serving as radio and microfilm channel for Major Nikolaus Ritter, head of the ''Abwehr'' Hamburg post's air intelligence section\".{{sfn|Richelson|1995|pp=139\u2013140}} Unfortunately for the Germans, who used Sebold successfully for a short period, he was discovered, and became a counterspy, and his communications to Germany were screened by the FBI.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=141}} Not every spy the ''Abwehr'' sent was captured or converted in this manner, but the Americans, and especially the British, proved mostly successful in countering the efforts of the German ''Abwehr'' officers, and used them to their advantage.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|pp=140\u2013143}}\n\nThe ''Abwehr'' was impaired by agents who aided the Allies in whatever covert means were necessary. Canaris personally gave false information that discouraged Hitler from invading Switzerland ([[Operation Tannenbaum]]). He also persuaded [[Francisco Franco]] not to allow German forces to pass through Spain to invade [[Gibraltar]] ([[Operation Felix]]), but it may have been just as much the imposition of the SD. The SD was allegedly spreading rumors about the partition of Spain. SD operatives also established a station at the central post office in Madrid to police mail going through Spain, and even attempted to assassinate one of Franco's pro-Allied generals, which strengthened Franco's intransigence to Hitler and the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\n===Repression and complicity===\nStill, images of the ''Abwehr'' as a veritable organ of resistance inside the heart of the Third Reich are not an accurate reflection across the spectrum of its entire operations or its personnel. There were some committed Nazis in its ranks. Before the invasion of Poland for instance, the ''Abwehr'' and SiPo jointly drew up a list of over sixty-thousand names, people who were to be the targets of [[Operation Tannenberg]], an effort designed to systematically identify and liquidate the Polish elite.{{sfn|Burleigh|2010|p=125}} For several months before the invasion of the Soviet Union, the ''Abwehr'' was key in deception operations set up to convince the British and the Soviets that Great Britain was under threat of imminent invasion, an undertaking which helped soften the eastern territories for Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=93}} Before the commencement of the attack on the Soviet Union, the ''Abwehr'' also spread rumours that the British talk of an impending German attack was nothing more than disinformation.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|pp=576\u2013577}}\n\nDuring January 1942, partisan fighters at the port city of Eupatoria in the Crimea assisted a Red Army landing there and revolted against the German occupying forces. Reinforcements were sent in under General [[Erich von Manstein]] and the port city was retaken. Reprisals against the partisans were carried out under the direction of Major Riesen, an ''Abwehr'' officer on the Eleventh Army's staff, who oversaw the execution of 1200 civilians, the bulks of whom were Jews.{{sfn|Lemay|2013|p=282}} Additional evidence over the duties assigned to operatives in theater are revealing. Out in the field, the army group commander of the G-2 was provided assistance for the army group ''Abwehr'' officer (''Frontaufklaerungskommando'' III), with additional help coming available from the secret field police. ''Abwehr'' officers in this capacity were tasked with overseeing personnel in counterintelligence, the safeguarding of classified information, and preventive security. The ''Frontaufklaerungskommando'' III received instructions concerning the ''Abwehr'' from ''OKH/General z.b.V./Gruppe Abwehr'', and \"informed army group G-2 of all ''Abwehr'' matters in a monthly report or special reports.\"{{sfn|United States War Dept. General Staff|1984|p=46}} Security within army headquarters was another area of responsibility so detachments of the secret field police were placed at his disposal and he cooperated with particular departments of the SD, the SS, and the police in order to be well versed in all fields of counterintelligence and kept tabs on guards, checking their reliability against available personnel records. According to the United States War Dept. General Staff,\n::The ''Abwehr'' officer maintained close liaison with ''Frontaufklaerungskommando'' III in order to be well informed about counterintelligence conditions, especially as far as the non-German population was concerned. The net of agents produced a clear picture of the morale and attitude of the population within the sector of the army group and reported on all activities of the enemy intelligence service, on resistance movements and other illegal groups, and on guerrilla conditions.{{sfn|United States War Dept. General Staff|1984|p=46}}\n\nAccording to Bauer, the ''Abwehr'' was more interested in perpetuating its own interests than it was in saving Jews.{{sfn|Bauer|1996|p=126}} While there are accounts of the ''Abwehr'' assisting Jews to safety via clandestinely arranged emigration,{{sfn|Roseman|2000|pp=129\u2013145, 250\u2013253}} there are also cases of ''Abwehr'' operatives enriching themselves in the process through bribes and other monetary payoffs.{{sfn|Roseman|2000|pp=137\u2013138}}{{efn|For more on the depths of corruption in Nazi Germany, see: Frank Bajohr, ''Parven\u00fcs und Profiteure: Korruption in der NS-Zeit''. Frankfurt: Fischer Verlag, 2001.}}\n\n===Undermining the regime===\nSeveral examples demonstrate that some ''Abwehr'' members were opposed to the Nazi regime. In January 1944 for example, American statesman [[John Foster Dulles]] revealed his knowledge of a coalescing resistance against the Nazis, an assemblage of intellectuals from military and government circles; his main contact was ''Abwehr'' officer [[Hans Bernd Gisevius]], who was stationed in Zurich as the German Vice Consul.{{sfn|Peterson|2002|p=281}} Dulles communicated with the ''Abwehr'' concerning their intrigue against Hitler and even attempted discussions about a separate peace, but President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] would have none of it, preferring instead a policy of unconditional surrender for the Nazi government.{{sfn|Peterson|2002|p=281}} Machinations against the National Socialists by the ''Abwehr'' were considerable in terms of the chain of command. General Oster of the ''Abwehr'' remained in regular contact with Dulles. Foreknowledge and penetration of the Abwehr was such that Dulles reported later in February 1944 that the ''Abwehr'' was going to be absorbed by the SD.{{sfn|Peterson|2002|p=281}}{{efn|Dulles was not the only one receiving reports from resistance groups. Efforts by dissident Germans to contact the Allies in Switzerland and elsewhere during 1944 are also documented in ''U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States'' (FRUS), 1944, vol. 1, General (Washington, DC, 1966), pp. 484-579.}}\n\nThe SS continually undermined the ''Abwehr'' by putting its officers under investigation, believing them to be involved in anti-Hitler plots. Heydrich ensured that the ''Abwehr'' and Canaris were closely monitored.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|p=226}} The SS also accused Canaris of being defeatist in his intelligence assessments, especially on the Russian campaign and the ''Abwehr'' was under investigation for treason related to the earlier attack on Belgrade.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\n===Eastern Front=== \nFollowing the launch of [[Operation Barbarossa]], an NKVD Soviet agent named Alexander Demyanov penetrated the ''Abwehr'' in late 1941 by posing as a member of a pro-German underground resistance with alleged access to the Soviet military leadership\u2014this was a complete fabrication concocted by the GRU and NKVD, who used Demyanov as a double agent.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=646}} During the autumn of 1942, Demyanov informed his German handlers that he was working as a communications officer at the Soviet HQ in Moscow, which would give him access to important intelligence, a ruse that managed to fool the Nazi intelligence commander on the Russian front at the time, [[Reinhard Gehlen]].{{sfn|Andrew|2018|pp=646\u2013647}} Demyanov manipulated the military operations around Stalingrad, convincing Gehlen that Army Group Center would be unable to move west of Moscow to aide  General Friedrich Paulus and the Sixth Army, which was ultimately encircled by the Red Army.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=647}}\n\nLikewise, a group of White Russians under General Anton Turkul sought [[asylum in Germany]] and offered to provide radio intelligence for the Germans and worked with the ''Abwehr'' in getting the necessary communication links established. One of the primary radio links was code-named MAX, supposedly located near the Kremlin. MAX was not the intelligence mechanism the ''Abwehr'' believed it to be, instead, it was \"a creature of the [[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]]\" , through which information was regularly disseminated concerning Foreign Armies East and Foreign Air Forces East and troop movements. Careful message trafficking and deception operations by the Soviets allowed them to misdirect the Germans and aided in the strategic surprise they enjoyed against Army Group Center in June 1944.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|pp=143\u2013144}} Even though the ''Abwehr'' no longer existed at this point, the heritage operations connected to MAX gave the Soviet armies an advantage they would not have otherwise possessed and further prove the extent of damage attributable to the ''Abwehr's'' incompetence, as Moscow's disinformation repeatedly fooled the German high command.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|pp=234\u2013237}}\n\n==The Frau Solf Tea Party and the end of the Abwehr==\n{{Main|German Resistance|Frau Solf Tea Party|Erich Vermehren}}\nOn 10 September 1943, the incident which eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ''Abwehr'' occurred. The incident came to be known as the \"[[Frau Solf Tea Party]].\"\n\n[[Hanna Solf]] was the widow of Dr. [[Wilhelm Solf]], a former Colonial Minister under [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and ex-[[Ambassador]] to [[Japan]]. Frau Solf had long been involved in the [[German Resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi intellectual movement]] in Berlin.  Members of her group were known as members of the \"Solf Circle.\" At a tea party hosted by her on 10 September, a new member was included into the circle, a handsome young Swiss doctor named [[Paul Reckzeh]]. Dr. Reckzeh was an agent of the [[Gestapo]] (Secret State Police), to which he reported on the meeting, providing several incriminating documents. The members of the Solf Circle were all rounded up on 12 January 1944. Eventually everyone who was involved in the Solf Circle, except Frau Solf and her daughter (the Countess Lagi Gr\u00e4fin von Ballestrem), were executed.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1,025}}{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|pp=304\u2013306}}\n\nOne of those executed was [[Otto Kiep]], an official in the Foreign Office, who had friends in the ''Abwehr'', among whom were [[Erich Vermehren]] and his wife, the former Countess Elizabeth [[House of Plettenberg|von Plettenberg]], who were stationed as agents in [[Istanbul]]. Both were summoned to Berlin by the Gestapo in connection with the Kiep case. Fearing for their lives, they contacted the British and defected.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=306}}{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nHitler had long suspected that the ''Abwehr'' had been infiltrated by anti-Nazi defectors and Allied agents, and the defection of Vemehren after the Solf Circle arrests all but confirmed it. It was also mistakenly believed in Berlin that the Vermehrens absconded with the secret codes of the ''Abwehr'' and turned them over to the British. That proved to be the last straw for Hitler. Despite the efforts of the ''Abwehr'' to shift the blame to the SS or even to the Foreign Ministry, Hitler had had enough of Canaris and he told Himmler so twice. He summoned the chief of the Abwehr for a final interview and accused him of allowing the ''Abwehr'' to \"fall to bits\". Canaris quietly agreed that it was \"not surprising\", as Germany was losing the war.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=282}}\n\nHitler fired Canaris on the spot, and on 18 February 1944, Hitler signed a decree that abolished the ''Abwehr''.{{efn|For a long time, Hitler had found the ''Abwehr'' suspect in terms of performance; they had not apprised the German military with any intelligence on the North African landings nor much thereafter,  leading him to conclude that the ''Abwehr'' and its leadership were basically incompetent. See: Waller (1996). ''The Unseen War in Europe: Espionage and Conspiracy in the Second World War'', pp. 330-331.}} Its functions were taken over by the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' or RSHA (Reich Main Security Office) and SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' and ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [Brigadier General] of Police Walter Schellenberg replaced Canaris functionally within the RSHA.  This action deprived the German Armed Forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') and the anti-Nazi conspirators of an intelligence service of its own and strengthened Himmler's control over the military.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|p=537}}\n\nCanaris was [[Cashiering|cashiered]] and given the empty title of Chief of the Office of Commercial and Economic Warfare. He was arrested on 23 July 1944, in the aftermath of the \"[[20 July Plot|July 20 Plot]]\" against Hitler and executed shortly before the end of the war, along with Oster, his deputy.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=698}} The functions of the ''Abwehr'' were then fully absorbed by ''Amt'' VI, ''[[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|SD-Ausland]]'', a sub-office of the RSHA, which was part of the SS.{{sfn|United States War Dept. General Staff|1984|p=3}}\n\n===The Zossen documents===\nDuring the war, the ''Abwehr'' assembled a secret dossier detailing many of the crimes committed in Eastern Europe by the Nazis, known as the Zossen documents. These files were gathered together with the intention of exposing the regime's crimes at a future date.{{sfn|McDonough|2005|p=44}} The documents were kept in a safe at the [[Maybach I and II|Zossen military headquarters]] not far from Berlin and remained under ''Abwehr'' control. Some of the papers were allegedly buried\u2014but the individual responsible for this ended up implicated in the [[20 July plot]] against Hitler and was executed. Later, the documents were discovered by the Gestapo and under the personal supervision of then SD Chief [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], they were taken to the castle Schloss Mittersill in the Tyrol and burned. Supposedly amid the Zossen documents was nothing less than the personal diary of Admiral Canaris, as well as the Vatican and Fritsch papers.{{sfn|Dulles|2000|p=73}}\n\n==Effectiveness and legacy==\nMany historians agree that, generally speaking, the ''Abwehr'' had a poor reputation for the quality of its work and its unusually decentralized organization.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|p=37}}{{sfn|Howard|1990|p=49}} Some of the ''Abwehr's'' less than stellar image and performance was due to the intense rivalry it had with the SS, the RSHA and with the SD.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=251}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=2}} Other considerations for the failings of the ''Abwehr'' could have something to do with Allied success in deciphering the German [[Enigma machine]] ciphers, namely thanks to the code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]].{{sfn|Andrew|2018|pp=616\u2013617}} During the August and September 1942 engagements in North Africa against Rommel, this Allied capability was a crucial element to Montgomery's success, as British signals intelligence [[SIGINT]] was superior to that of the Germans.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=640, 644\u2013645}}\n\nAmerican historian [[Robin Winks]] says that the ''Abwehr'' was, \"an abysmal failure, failing to forecast [[Operation Torch|Torch]], or [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Husky]], or [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]].\"{{sfn|Winks|1996|p=281}} English historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] says it was, \"rotten with corruption, notoriously inefficient, [and] politically suspect.\" He adds that it was under the \"negligent rule\" of Admiral Canaris, who was \"more interested in anti-Nazi intrigue than in his official duties.\" Historian [[Norman Davies]] agrees with this observation and avows that Canaris \"was anything but a Nazi enthusiast\".{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=251}} According to Trevor-Roper, for the first two years of the war it was a \"happy parasite\" that was \"borne along...on the success of the German Army.\" When the tide turned against the Nazis and the ''Abwehr'' was unable to produce the intelligence the leadership demanded, it was merged into the SS in 1944.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1992|p=75}} Numerous intelligence failures and general incompetence led to catastrophic disasters in both the eastern and western campaigns for the German military.{{sfn|Archer|Ferris|Herwig|Travers|2002|pp=524\u2013525}}{{efn|One officer from the German General Staff during Operation Barbarossa described the ''Abwehr's'' intelligence contribution to the war effort as nothing more than ''Mist'', which is German for manure or dung.

Members of the ''Abwehr'' were important in helping lay the groundwork (along with the SD) for the ''Anschlu\u00df'' with Austria and during the annexation of Czechoslovakia, an ''Abwehr'' group also aided in the seizure of a strategically important railway tunnel in Polish-Silesia in the final week of August 1939.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=251}} Historian Walter Goerlitz claimed in his seminal work, ''History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945'', that Canaris and the ''Abwehr'' formed the \"real centre of military opposition to the regime\",{{sfn|Goerlitz|1985|p=295}} a view which many others do not share. Former OSS station chief and later director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Allen Dulles]], evaluated German intelligence officers from the ''Abwehr'' at the end of the war and concluded that only the upper echelons were active dissenters and part of the opposition movement. According to Dulles, the ''Abwehr'' participated in a lot more than just machinations against Hitler's regime and asserted that approximately 95 percent of the ''Abwehr'' actively worked \u201cagainst the Allies\u201d whereas only about 5 percent of them were anti-Nazi in disposition.{{sfn|Dulles|2000|pp=75\u201376}}  Military historian [[John Wheeler-Bennett]] wrote that the ''Abwehr'' \"failed conspicuously as a secret intelligence service\", that it was \"patently and incontestably inefficient\" and adds that members of the ''Abwehr'' \"displayed no great efficiency either as intelligence officers or as conspirators...\"{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1980|p=597}} Whatever successes the ''Abwehr'' enjoyed before the start of the Second World War, there were virtually none once the war began and worse, the British successfully ran 19 double agents through the Abwehr which fed them false information, duping the German intelligence service to the very end.{{sfn|Blandford|2001|pp=23\u201324}}{{efn|So thorough was the British penetration of German military intelligence, that not one single agent the ''Abwehr'' had in Great Britain was legitimate.

horse left by the departing Greeks.\"{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=367}}}}{{efn|Attempts by the ''Abwehr'' to cencourage anti-colonial rebellion against the British Empire in Ireland (through contacts with the

Seaton makes an important observation regarding the German Army's failures as a result of poor intelligence by asserting that all too often, decisions were made as a result of the opinion of Hitler and that he imposed ''his'' views on the military chain of command and therewith, the choice of actions taken during the war.{{sfn|Seaton|1982|p=221}} Max Hastings makes similar claims about the general nature of totalitarians systems, where in Nazi Germany, intelligence assessments had to be adjusted within the constraints of what Hitler would accept.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=65}} Nonetheless,

The OKW was part of the F\u00fchrer's personal \"working staff\" from June 1938 and the ''Abwehr'' became its intelligence agency under Vice-Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]].{{sfn|Taylor|1995|p=165}}{{efn|The OKW did not establish an Intelligence Branch in its Operations Staff until 1943, and, when it did, it only consisted of three officers.}} Its [[headquarters]] was located at 76/78 Tirpitzufer, [[Berlin]], adjacent to the offices of the OKW.{{efn|Despite the location of its HQ, in reality the power lay in the field via the \"''Abwehrstelle''\" or \"Ast\" of the ''Abwehr''\u2014see section titled 1938 reorganization.}}\n\n==Before Canaris==\nThe ''Abwehr'' was created in 1920 as part of the [[Ministry of the Reichswehr|German Ministry of Defence]] when the German government was allowed to form the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', the [[Armed Forces|military organization]] of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The first head of the ''Abwehr'' was Major [[Friedrich Gempp]], a former deputy to Colonel [[Walter Nicolai]], the head of German intelligence during [[World War I]], who proved mostly ineffectual.{{sfn|Paine|1984|p=7}} At that time it was composed of only three officers and seven former officers, plus a clerical staff. When Gempp became a general, he was promoted out of the job as chief, to be followed by Major G\u00fcnther Schwantes, whose term as the organization's leader was also brief.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=224\u2013225}} Many members of the ''Reichswehr'' (a significant portion of them Prussian) declined when asked to consider intelligence work, since for them, it was outside the realm of actual military service and the act of spying clashed with their Prussian military sensibilities of always showing themselves direct, loyal, and sincere.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=44}} By the 1920s, the slowly growing ''Abwehr'' was organised into three sections:\n\n{{ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|[[Reconnaissance]]\n|[[Cipher]] and Radio Monitoring\n|[[Counterintelligence|Counterespionage]]}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' intelligence staff merged with the ''Abwehr'' in 1928.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=225}} While the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from engaging in any form of espionage or spying, during the Nazi era the ''Abwehr'' disregarded this prohibition, as they saw it as hypocritical.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=573}}\n\nIn the 1930s, with the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement, the Ministry of Defence was reorganised; surprisingly, on 7 June 1932, a naval officer, Captain Konrad Patzig, was named chief of the ''Abwehr'', despite the fact that it was staffed largely by army officers.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=93}} Proving himself quite a capable chief, Patzig swiftly assured the military of his intentions and worked to earn their respect; he established good connections with the Lithuanian clandestine service against the Soviets, forged relations with other foreign agencies\u2014except for Italy, whose cipher he distrusted.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=94}} His successes did not stop the other branches of the military services from developing their own intelligence staffs.\n\nAfter the Nazis seized power, the ''Abwehr'' began sponsoring reconnaissance flights across the border with [[Poland]], under the direction of Patzig, but this led to confrontations with [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Army leaders also feared that the flights would endanger the secret plans for an attack on Poland. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the termination of the overflights in 1934 after he signed a [[German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact|nonaggression treaty with Poland]] since these reconnaissance missions might be discovered and jeopardize the treaty.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=96}} Patzig was fired in January 1935 as a result, and sent to command the new [[Deutschland-class cruiser|pocket battleship]] [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']]; he later became Chief of Naval Personnel. His replacement was another ''Reichsmarine'' captain, [[Wilhelm Canaris]].{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=97\u201399}}\n\n==Under Canaris==\n\n===Before World War II===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-013-43, Wilhelm Canaris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm Canaris]]]]\n\nBefore he took over the ''Abwehr'' on 1 January 1935, the soon-to-be Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris|Canaris]] was warned by Patzig of attempts by Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to take over all German intelligence organizations.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=96\u201399}} Heydrich, who headed the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) from 1931, had a negative attitude towards the ''Abwehr''\u2014shaped in part by his belief that Germany's defeat in the First World War was primarily attributable to failures of military intelligence,{{efn|A view Heydrich acquired from Walter Nicolai's 1923 book, ''Geheime M\u00e4chte'', in which the author argues that Imperial Germany lost the war as a result of not having a capable intelligence agency comparable to the ones operated by Britain and France.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=84}} }} and by his ambitions to control all political intelligence-gathering for Germany.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2012|p=85}}\n\nCanaris, a master of backroom dealings, thought he knew how to deal with Heydrich and Himmler. Though he tried to maintain a cordial relationship with them, the antagonism between the ''Abwehr'' and the SS did not stop when Canaris took over. Not only was competition with Heydrich and Himmler's intelligence operations a hindrance, so too were the redundant attempts by multiple organizations to control [[communications intelligence]] (COMINT) for the Reich. For instance, Canaris's Abwehr controlled the Armed Forces Deciphering operation, while the navy maintained its own listening service, known as the ''B-Dienst''. Further complicating COMINT matters, the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] also had its own communications security branch, the ''[[Pers Z S]]''.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=86}}\n\nMatters came to a head in 1937 when Hitler decided to help [[Joseph Stalin]] in the latter's [[Great Purge|purge]] of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]].  Hitler ordered that the German Army staff should be kept in the dark about Stalin's intentions, for fear that they would warn their Soviet counterparts due to their [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941#Soviet Russia and Weimar Germany|long-standing relations]]. Accordingly, special SS teams, accompanied by burglary experts from the [[Kriminalpolizei|criminal police]], broke into the secret files of the General Staff and the ''Abwehr'' and removed documents related to German-Soviet collaboration. To conceal the thefts, fires were started at the break-ins, which included ''Abwehr'' headquarters.{{sfn|Schellenberg|2000|pp=25\u201327}}\n\n===Canaris to Spain===\nUnaware that Canaris would eventually try to subvert his plans, Hitler sent him as a special envoy to Madrid during the early summer of 1940 to convince Spain to join in the coming fight against the Allies, for which Gibraltar could have strategic military value.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Instead of convincing [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] to assist the Nazi regime, Canaris advised him to stay out of the fight since he was certain the war was going to end in disaster for Germany.{{sfn|Goerlitz|1985|p=384}} Thus, instead of helping the Nazis elicit allies to their side, the ''Abwehr'' (by way of Canaris and others) was covertly undermining the regime under which they served.\n\n===1938 reorganisation===\nBefore the reorganization of the OKW in 1938, the ''Abwehr'' was merely a department within the ''Reichswehrministerium'' (Ministry of Armed Forces), and it was not until after Canaris was appointed chief that its numbers increased and it gained some independence.{{sfn|Blandford|2001|p=18}} Experiencing an explosion in personnel of sorts, the ''Abwehr'' went from fewer than 150 employees to nearly one-thousand between 1935 and 1937.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=114}} Canaris reorganized the agency in 1938, subdividing the ''Abwehr'' into three main sections:\n\n*'''The Central Division''' (also called Department Z\u2014''\"Abteilung Z\"'' or ''\"die Zentrale\"'' in German): acted as the controlling brain for the other two sections, as well as handling personnel and financial matters, including the payment of agents.  Throughout Canaris's tenure it was headed by ''Generalmajor'' [[Hans Oster]].\n*'''The Foreign Branch''', (''\"Amtsgruppe Ausland\"'' in German) (later known as '''Foreign Intelligence Group''') was the second subdivision of the Abwehr and had several functions:\n*#liaison with the OKW and the general staffs of the services,\n*#coordination with the German Foreign Ministry on military matters, and\n*#evaluation of captured documents and evaluation of foreign press and radio broadcasts.  This liaison with the OKW meant that the Foreign Branch was the appropriate channel to request ''Abwehr'' support for a particular mission.\n*'''Abwehr''' constituted the third division and was labeled \"counter-intelligence branches\" but in reality focused on intelligence gathering.  It was subdivided into the following areas and responsibilities:\n**'''I.''' Foreign Intelligence Collection (further subdivided by letter, e.g. ''Abwehr'' I-Ht)\n**: '''G''': false documents, photos, inks, passports, chemicals\n**: '''H West''': army west (Anglo-American Army intelligence)\n**: '''[[Foreign Armies East|H Ost]]''': army east (Soviet Army intelligence)\n**: '''Ht''': technical army intelligence\n**: '''I''': communications\u2014design of wireless sets, wireless operators\n**: '''K''': computer/cryptanalysis operations\n**: '''L''': air intelligence\n**: '''M''': naval intelligence\n**: '''T/lw''': technical air intelligence\n**: '''Wi''': economic intelligence\n**: Attached to ''Abwehr'' I. was Gruppe I-T for technical intelligence. Initially ''Abwehr'' I-K was a technical research unit, a small fraction the size of its British counterpart, Britain's [[Bletchley Park]]. Its importance later grew during the war to match its British counterpart in size and capability.\n**'''II.''' [[Sabotage]]: tasked with directing covert contact / exploitation of discontented minority groups in foreign countries for intelligence purposes.\n**:Attached to ''Abwehr'' II. was the [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburg Regiment]], an offshoot of Gruppe II-T (Technical Intelligence), and unconnected to any other branch outside of ''Abwehr'' II. Gruppe II-T.{{efn|Sometimes referred to as the 'Brandenburgers' of 'Brandenburger Regiment', the Brandenburg Regiment were the first German [[special forces]] unit similar to the British Commandos.}}\n**'''III.''' [[Counter-intelligence]] division: responsible for counter-intelligence operations in German industry, planting false information, penetration of foreign intelligence services and investigating acts of sabotage on German soil.  Attached to ''Abwehr'' III. were:\n::: '''IIIC''': Civilian Authority bureau\n::: '''IIIC-2''': Espionage cases bureau\n::: '''IIID''': Disinformation bureau\n::: '''IIIF''': Counter espionage agents bureau\n::: '''IIIN''': Postal bureau\n\n''Abwehr'' liaisons were also established with the army, navy and Luftwaffe High Commands, and these liaisons would pass on specific intelligence requests to the operational sections of the ''Abwehr''.\n\n''Abwehr'' I was commanded by Colonel Hans Pieckenbrock,{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=236}} ''Abwehr'' II was commanded by Colonel [[Erwin von Lahousen]] and ''Abwehr'' III was commanded by Colonel Egbert Bentivegni. These three officers formed the core of the Abwehr.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=115}}\n\n===''Ast / Abwehrstelle''===\nUnder the structure outlined above, the ''Abwehr'' placed a local station in each military district in Germany, (''\"Wehrkreis\"''), called ''''Abwehrstelle'''' or ''''Ast''''.  Following the German Table of Organisation and Equipment{{efn|TO&E being the exact listing of what was deemed necessary for any German military unit to be at full operational strength. An exception to this TO&E directive existed in Hamburg which had no permanent ''Abwehr'' II presence.}} model of ''Abwehr'' headquarters, each ''Ast'' was usually subdivided into sections for\n\n{{ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|espionage\n|sabotage\n|counter-intelligence}}\n\nTypically each ''Ast'' would be commanded by a senior army or naval officer and would be answerable to ''Abwehr'' HQ. in Berlin.  Operations carried out by each ''Ast'' would be in tandem with the overall strategic plan formulated by Admiral Canaris.  Canaris in turn would receive instructions on what intelligence gathering should take priority from the OKW or, increasingly after 1941, Hitler directly. In practice, each ''Ast'' was given considerable latitude in mission planning and execution\u2014a facet of the organisation which ultimately damaged its intelligence gathering capability.\n\nEach local ''Ast'' could recruit potential agents for missions and the ''Abwehr'' also employed freelance recruiters to groom and vet potential agents.  In most cases, the agents were recruited civilians, not officers/soldiers from the military.  The recruitment emphasis seems to have been very much on \"quantity\" not \"quality\".  The poor quality of recruits often led to the failure of ''Abwehr'' missions.{{efn|Evidence of the ''Abwehr's'' substandard performance related to recruiting is mentioned in once classified American military documents.

Such postings were referred to as \"War Organisations\" (''\"Kriegsorganisationen\"'' or ''\"KO's\"'' in German).{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=243}}  In neutral but friendly [[Spain]] for example, the ''Abwehr'' had both an ''Ast'' and a KO while [[Ireland]] had neither.  In friendly countries of interest, occupied countries, or in Germany, the intelligence service would normally organise \"Abwehr sub-stations\" (''\"Abwehrleitstellen\"'' in German or ''\"Alsts\"'' in German), or \"Abwehr adjoining posts\" (''\"Abwehrnebenstellen\"'' in German).  The ''\"Alsts\"'' would fall under the jurisdiction of the geographically appropriate ''Ast'', which in turn would be supervised by the Central division in Berlin. For a while, the KOs were tolerated by the neutral countries and those who feared Germany too much to protest but as the Allied powers waged war against Germany, many of the KOs were simply expelled at the host countries request\u2014due at least in part to pressure from the Allies.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=243\u2013248}}\n\n===Canaris and ''Die Schwarze Kapelle''===\nWhen the ''Abwehr'' was reorganized, Canaris took care to surround himself with a hand-picked staff, notably his second-in-command, Hans Oster and Section II Chief, [[Erwin Lahousen|Erwin von Lahousen]]. None were members of the Nazi Party except one. The exception was [[Rudolf Bamler]], who was appointed chief of Section III by Canaris to gain the trust of Himmler.  Canaris kept Bamler on a short leash and restricted his access to operational information.  Canaris had good reason to do this because, unknown to the High Command and Hitler, he had peppered his chief operational and administrative staff with men more loyal to him than to the Nazi Government.  While outwardly Canaris appeared to be the model of intelligence-gathering efficiency, evidence exists that he secretly opposed, and actively worked against the wishes of Hitler.  Canaris, Oster and the Chiefs of ''Abwehr'' sections I and II were all heavily involved in what the SD later dubbed \"[[Black Orchestra|The Black Orchestra]]\" (''\"Die Schwarze Kapelle\"'' in German), a plot to overthrow the Nazi regime from the inside.{{efn|The Black Orchestra being distinct from \"[[Red Orchestra (spy)|The Red Orchestra]]\" (''\"Die Rote Kapelle\"'' in German)- a largely communist organised plot to overthrow the Nazi Regime from the inside. See: ''Penguin Dictionary of the Third Reich'', London, 1997 for a listing of ''Abwehr'' officers involved in both.}}  Canaris's operational decisions, his choice of appointments and their decisions, and \u2013 crucially for the [[Third Reich]] \u2013 the input each plotter had into ''Abwehr'' operations, were all tainted by these secret dealings.{{efn|For more on the significance of the Canaris circle and how their actions were shaped in this regard, see: Olav Herfeldt's, ''Schwarze Kapelle. Spionage und Widerstand. Die Geschichte der Widerstansgruppe um Admiral Wilhelm Canaris''. Augsburg: Weltbild, 1990. {{ISBN|978-3-89350-077-2}} }}\n\n====Early Abwehr intrigue====\nBefore the war began, the ''Abwehr'' was fairly active and effective as it built a wide range of contacts; they developed links with the Ukrainians opposed to the Soviet regime, conducted meetings with Indian nationalists who were trying to free themselves from British imperialism, and established an information-sharing agreement with the Japanese.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|pp=64\u201366}} There was even some significant penetration into the extent of the United States industrial capacity and economic potential,{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=85\u201388}} and data was collected by the ''Abwehr'' concerning American military capacity and contingency planning.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|p=98}}\n\nSometime in March 1937, senior ''Abwehr'' officer [[Paul Th\u00fcmmel]] provided a vast array of significant information about the German intelligence services to Czech agents who in turn, forwarded the data to [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] London. Th\u00fcmmel also delivered details over \"military capabilities, and intentions\" as well as \"detailed information on the organization and structure of the ''Abwehr'' and SD along with \"the near-complete order of battle of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, and German mobilization plans\"; and, later \"he gave advanced warnings of the German annexation of the Sudetenland as well as the invasions of [[Czechoslovakia]] and Poland.\"{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=84}}\n\nAfter assumption of absolute control over the OKW in February 1938, Hitler declared that he did not want men of intelligence under his command, but men of brutality, an observation which did not sit well with Canaris.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=142\u2013143}} Whether he was deeply troubled by Hitler's comment or not, Canaris and the ''Abwehr'' still busied themselves preparing the ideological groundwork for the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] which occurred in March 1938.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nA month later, Canaris and the ''Abwehr'' were set to work subverting the Czechs as part of Hitler's strategy to acquire the [[Sudetenland]].{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=118\u2013119}} Before the spring of 1938 came to an end, the conservative members of the German Foreign Office and many ranking officers in the military began sharing their fears over an impending international disaster and the threat of another catastrophic European war based on Hitler's actions. A conspiratorial group formed around General [[Erwin von Witzleben]] and Admiral Canaris as a result.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1973|pp=70\u201371}} Throughout the process, Canaris and subordinates such as [[Helmuth Groscurth]] worked to prevent war to the extent feasible. Meanwhile, Canaris participated in the plots among the military leadership for a coup against Hitler and attempted to open up covert communication lines with the British, convinced that Hitler would push Europe to war.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=147\u2013164}}  Before the actual invasion of Poland occurred, the ''Abwehr'' went so far as to send a special emissary, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, to London in order to warn them.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=585}} Subverting the Nazi government with warnings to the Allies was but one part of the picture, as this move did not stop or deter Canaris from obeying Hitler's orders to provide 150 Polish army uniforms and small arms to Himmler and Heydrich for their [[Gleiwitz incident|staged attack on a German radio station by 'Polish' forces]]; one act which Hitler used to justify his assault on Poland.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=518}}\n\nIn December 1940, Hitler again sent Canaris to Spain to conclude an agreement (through strong coercion if necessary) with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] for Spanish support in the war against the Allies, but instead of prompting the Spaniard to acquiesce to Hitler's desire, Canaris reported that Franco would not commit Spanish forces until England collapsed.{{sfn|Rich|1973|pp=173\u2013174}} Conversations from this period between Franco and Admiral Canaris remain a mystery since none were recorded, but the Spanish government later expressed gratitude to the widow of Canaris at the conclusion of the Second World War by paying her a pension.{{sfn|Rich|1973|p=174}}\n\n==During World War II==\n\n===Early successes===\nUnder Canaris, the ''Abwehr'' expanded and proved to be efficient during the early years of the war. Its most notable success was [[Operation Nordpol]], which was an operation against the Dutch underground network, which at the time was supported by the [[Special Operations Executive]].{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=176\u2013177}} Concomitant to the period known as the [[Phoney War]], the ''Abwehr'' collected information on Denmark and Norway. Shipping in and out of Danish and Norwegian ports was placed under observation and over 150,000 tons of shipping was destroyed as a result. Agents in Norway and Denmark successfully penetrated their military thoroughly enough to determine the disposition and strength of land forces in both countries and deep-cover ''Abwehr'' operatives kept the German forces, particularly the Luftwaffe, intimately informed during the invasion of Norway. Against both of these nations, the ''Abwehr'' mounted what one would call a successful intelligence operation of some scale and proved itself critical to the success of German military endeavors there.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|pp=81\u201386}}\n\nFear over the drastically low levels of available petroleum at the beginning of 1940 prompted activity from the German Foreign Office and the ''Abwehr'' in an attempt to ameliorate the problem \"by concluding an unprecedented arms-for-oil\" deal, brokered so as to push back the \"Anglo-French dominance in the Ploie\u0219ti oilfield.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=381}} ''Abwehr'' operatives also played on Romanian fears, making them more amenable to Hitler's offer to shield them from the Soviets\u2014through which the Germans acquired cheap oil.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=381\u2013382}} In this regard, the ''Abwehr'' provided some semblance of economic utility for the Nazi regime.\n\nIn March 1941, the Germans forced a captured SOE radio operator to transmit messages to Britain in a code that the Germans had obtained. Even though the operator gave indications that he was compromised, the receiver in Britain did not notice. Thus the Germans were able to penetrate the Dutch operation and maintained this state of affairs for two years, capturing agents, and sending false intelligence and [[sabotage]] reports until the British caught on. In ''Bodyguard of Lies'' Anthony Brown suggests that the British were well aware that the radios were compromised and used this method to feed false information to the Germans regarding the site of the D-Day landings.{{sfn|Brown|1975|pp=464\u2013466}}\n\n===Underestimating the enemy and the Commissar Order===\nInitial estimates of the Soviet [[Red Army]]'s will and capability were low, a line of thinking shared by the Nazi hierarchy. A great deal has been made by historians over this fact, but some of the German General Staff's optimism was the result of estimates provided by the ''Abwehr'', whose assessments left the German General Staff believing that the Red Army only possessed ninety infantry divisions, twenty-three cavalry divisions, and a mere twenty-eight mechanized brigades.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|p=282}} By the time the reappraisal of the Red Army by German military intelligence occurred in mid-June 1941 (which was about 25 percent higher than previously reported), it was a foregone conclusion that Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union was going to take place.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|p=283}}\n\nLate assessments from the ''Abwehr'' contributed to military overconfidence and their reporting mechanism said nothing of the massive mobilization capability of the Soviet Union, an oversight that arguably contributed to the German defeat since time-tables were so important for German success. The German Army's failure to reach its objectives in short order proved pivotal; once winter came, improperly outfitted German forces suffered when supplies did not reach them.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|pp=283\u2013284}}{{efn|It is doubtful that more accurate reporting would have deterred Hitler since at one point during the planning phase of Operation Barbarossa, General [[Georg Thomas]], then head of the Defence Economy and Armament Office of the OKW, was scolded and patronized when he warned of insufficient fuel reserves for the attack, and voiced complaints about logistics due to the different gauges between German and Russian railways. See: Barnett (2003). ''Hitler's Generals'', p. 115.}}{{efn|Postwar historical analysis garnered from interviews with surviving members of the German General Staff make it appear as if they were completely informed and aware of the Soviet Union's true potential and fighting capacity.{{sfn|Goerlitz|1985|pp=387\u2013395}} Other sources seem to refute these claims as mere attempts to save face by the defeated German generals. For example, historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the common view among Germans was that the war with the Soviet Union would be quick and easy, and adds further evidence about the lack of any specialized weapon development for the coming conflict with the Red Army. Only after the Germans faced the T-34 did they modify and develop their tanks.{{sfn|Weinberg|1996|pp=155\u2013156}} }} Overestimating their capabilities and trusting their own assessments too much, as well as underestimating their enemies (especially the Soviets and the Americans),{{efn|When General Franz Halder informed Hitler in 1942 that the Russian factories were producing between 600-700 tanks per month, Hitler flew into a rage and refused to believe that such quantities were possible. See: Liddel-Hart (1979). ''The German Generals Talk'', p. 195.}} atop long-standing traditions of unconditional obedience, comprised a historically central weakness in the German system, according to historian Klaus Fischer.{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=445}}\n\nOn 8 September 1941, under the auspices of the [[Commissar Order]] (''Kommissarbefehl'') the OKW issued a decree concerning the ruthless ideological imperatives of the Nazi state against all semblance of Bolshevism, a provision that included executing Soviet [[commissar]]s and prisoners of war.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1968|pp=523\u2013525}} Admiral Canaris, the head of the ''OKW Ausland/Abwehr'', immediately expressed concern about the military and political ramifications of this order. Killing soldiers and even non-combatants in contravention of the [[Geneva Convention]] was not something the ''Abwehr'' leadership\u2014namely Canaris\u2014supported.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=223}}\n\n===North Africa and the Middle East===\nThe ''Abwehr'' was active in North Africa leading up to and during the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of 1941-42. North Africa, like other cases, proved disastrous for the ''Abwehr''.  The greatest failure occurred as a result of deception operations conducted by the British.  An Italian of Jewish ancestry was recruited in France sometime in 1940 by the ''Abwehr''. Unknown to the Germans, this individual was an agent codenamed \"Cheese\" who was already working for the British SIS before the war began. In February 1941, the ''Abwehr'' sent Cheese to Egypt to report on any British military operations; instead of providing his German handlers with accurate information, he passed strategic deception materials and hundreds of MI5 doctored messages to Nazi intelligence by way of a fictitious sub-agent named \u2018Paul Nicosoff\u2019, helping to ensure the success of [[Operation Torch]].{{sfn|Walton|2013|p=41}} Confirmation of this fact came when one of Hitler's most trusted military advisers, Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, General [[Alfred Jodl]], later informed his Allied interrogators that the Allied landings in North Africa came as a total surprise to the German general staff.{{sfn|Holt|2004|pp=218, 270}}{{efn|During the spring of 1941, the ''Abwehr'' dispatched a Palestine-born Jew named Ernst Paul Fackenheim (who had been in a concentration camp) back to his place of birth to apprise the Germans over British efforts to prevent General [[Erwin Rommel]] from seizing the Suez Canal. Instead of reporting information back to the Nazis, Fackenheim, who had been dropped by parachute into Palestine, promptly turned himself over to the Allies.{{sfn|Walton|2013|pp=48\u201349}} }}\n\nThe need for upwards of 500 more agents to supplement intelligence operations in North Africa prompted the ''Abwehr'' to get creative. Arab prisoners of war (POWs) languishing in French camps were offered a trip back to their homeland if they agreed to spy for the Germans in North Africa, as were Soviet POWs in the east.{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=273}} Other intelligence collection efforts included working closely with the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' on aerial reconnaissance missions over North Africa. Previously, aerial reconnaissance was ordered by army intelligence officers of the Army Group HQ (part of the structure to which the ''Abwehr'' was assigned).{{sfn|Kahn|1978|pp=125\u2013130}} Major Witilo von Griesheim was sent to (Italian) Libya in early 1941 to set up AST Tripoli (code name WIDO). He soon set up a network of agents and wireless stations gathering information in Libya and in the surrounding French territories. In mid-July 1941, Admiral Canaris ordered ''Luftwaffe'' Major Nikolaus Ritter of ''Abwehr'' I to form a unit to infiltrate Egypt through the desert to make contact with the Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, el Masri Pasha, but this effort repeatedly failed.{{sfn|Molinari|2013|p=48}} Accompanying Ritter in Libya was the Hungarian [[desert exploration|desert explorer]] [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] with a mission to gather intelligence from British-occupied [[Egypt]]. After Ritter was injured and sent away, Alm\u00e1sy took over command, and organised the 1942 [[Operation Salaam|Operation Salam]], which succeeded in transporting two German agents across the [[Libyan Desert]] behind enemy lines to Egypt. In July 1942, Alm\u00e1sy and his agents were captured by British counterintelligence operatives.{{efn|One of the men taken into British custody (recruited to assist in communicating information between Egypt and Berlin) was a young Egyptian signals intelligence officer named [[Anwar Sadat]] (later President of Egypt).{{sfn|Walton|2013|p=50}} }}\n\nOther operations in North Africa were occurring concomitantly with those of Alm\u00e1sy and Ritter. During late January 1942 for instance, the OKW authorized the creation of a special unit, ''Sonderkommando Dora'', which was placed under the command of ''Abwehr'' officer, Oberstleutnant Walter Eichler (formerly a Panzer officer as well).{{sfn|Molinari|2013|p=48}}  The unit included geologists, cartographers, and mineralogists, who were sent into North Africa to study desert topography and assess the terrain for military use, but by November 1942\u2014following the Axis retreat from [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]\u2014''Sonderkommando Dora'' along with the [[Brandenburgers]] operating in the area, were withdrawn from the Sahara altogether.{{sfn|Molinari|2013|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nAn Iranian national recruited in Hamburg by the ''Abwehr'' before the war was converted into a double agent by British and Russian intelligence officers (working together in one of the few joint intelligence efforts of the war), who code-named him \"Kiss\". From late 1944 until the end of the war, Kiss, who was based out of the intelligence center in Baghdad, provided false information on Soviet and British troop movements in Iraq and Iran to the ''Abwehr''; as directed by his Allied controllers.{{sfn|Walton|2013|p=70}} On the Afghan border, the ''Abwehr'' sought to turn the [[Faqir of Ipi]] against British forces. They infiltrated the region using Manfred Oberdorffer, a physician, and [[Fred Hermann Brandt]], an entomologist under the guise of a medical mission to conduct research on leprosy.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\n===Questionable commitment and recruiting===\nJust how committed to German victory were typical members of the ''Abwehr'' is difficult to assess, but if its leadership tells a story, it is not one of conviction. For instance, during March 1942 when many Germans still had confidence in their F\u00fchrer and their army, Canaris saw things differently and told General [[Friedrich Fromm]] that there was no way Germany could win the war.{{efn|Diary of the Chief of Staff, Befehlhabers des Ersatzheeres, 20 March 1942, Imperial War Museum, MI 14/981/3.{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=298}} }}\n\nCanaris had made the United States a primary target even before its entry into the conflict. By 1942, German agents were operating from within all of America's top armaments manufacturers. The ''Abwehr'' also suffered a very public debacle in [[Operation Pastorius]], which resulted in the executions of six ''Abwehr'' agents sent to the United States to sabotage the American aluminum industry. The ''Abwehr'' attempted use coercion as a means to infiltrate the United States when they 'recruited' a naturalized American citizen visiting Germany, William G. Sebold, by Gestapo threats and blackmail, code-naming him TRAMP, and assigning him the task of \"serving as radio and microfilm channel for Major Nikolaus Ritter, head of the ''Abwehr'' Hamburg post's air intelligence section\".{{sfn|Richelson|1995|pp=139\u2013140}} Unfortunately for the Germans, who used Sebold successfully for a short period, he was discovered, and became a counterspy, and his communications to Germany were screened by the FBI.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|p=141}} Not every spy the ''Abwehr'' sent was captured or converted in this manner, but the Americans, and especially the British, proved mostly successful in countering the efforts of the German ''Abwehr'' officers, and used them to their advantage.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|pp=140\u2013143}}\n\nThe ''Abwehr'' was impaired by agents who aided the Allies in whatever covert means were necessary. Canaris personally gave false information that discouraged Hitler from invading Switzerland ([[Operation Tannenbaum]]). He also persuaded [[Francisco Franco]] not to allow German forces to pass through Spain to invade [[Gibraltar]] ([[Operation Felix]]), but it may have been just as much the imposition of the SD. The SD was allegedly spreading rumors about the partition of Spain. SD operatives also established a station at the central post office in Madrid to police mail going through Spain, and even attempted to assassinate one of Franco's pro-Allied generals, which strengthened Franco's intransigence to Hitler and the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=196\u2013200}}\n\n===Repression and complicity===\nStill, images of the ''Abwehr'' as a veritable organ of resistance inside the heart of the Third Reich are not an accurate reflection across the spectrum of its entire operations or its personnel. There were some committed Nazis in its ranks. Before the invasion of Poland for instance, the ''Abwehr'' and SiPo jointly drew up a list of over sixty-thousand names, people who were to be the targets of [[Operation Tannenberg]], an effort designed to systematically identify and liquidate the Polish elite.{{sfn|Burleigh|2010|p=125}} For several months before the invasion of the Soviet Union, the ''Abwehr'' was key in deception operations set up to convince the British and the Soviets that Great Britain was under threat of imminent invasion, an undertaking which helped soften the eastern territories for Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=93}} Before the commencement of the attack on the Soviet Union, the ''Abwehr'' also spread rumours that the British talk of an impending German attack was nothing more than disinformation.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|pp=576\u2013577}}\n\nDuring January 1942, partisan fighters at the port city of Eupatoria in the Crimea assisted a Red Army landing there and revolted against the German occupying forces. Reinforcements were sent in under General [[Erich von Manstein]] and the port city was retaken. Reprisals against the partisans were carried out under the direction of Major Riesen, an ''Abwehr'' officer on the Eleventh Army's staff, who oversaw the execution of 1200 civilians, the bulks of whom were Jews.{{sfn|Lemay|2013|p=282}} Additional evidence over the duties assigned to operatives in theater are revealing. Out in the field, the army group commander of the G-2 was provided assistance for the army group ''Abwehr'' officer (''Frontaufklaerungskommando'' III), with additional help coming available from the secret field police. ''Abwehr'' officers in this capacity were tasked with overseeing personnel in counterintelligence, the safeguarding of classified information, and preventive security. The ''Frontaufklaerungskommando'' III received instructions concerning the ''Abwehr'' from ''OKH/General z.b.V./Gruppe Abwehr'', and \"informed army group G-2 of all ''Abwehr'' matters in a monthly report or special reports.\"{{sfn|United States War Dept. General Staff|1984|p=46}} Security within army headquarters was another area of responsibility so detachments of the secret field police were placed at his disposal and he cooperated with particular departments of the SD, the SS, and the police in order to be well versed in all fields of counterintelligence and kept tabs on guards, checking their reliability against available personnel records. According to the United States War Dept. General Staff,\n::The ''Abwehr'' officer maintained close liaison with ''Frontaufklaerungskommando'' III in order to be well informed about counterintelligence conditions, especially as far as the non-German population was concerned. The net of agents produced a clear picture of the morale and attitude of the population within the sector of the army group and reported on all activities of the enemy intelligence service, on resistance movements and other illegal groups, and on guerrilla conditions.{{sfn|United States War Dept. General Staff|1984|p=46}}\n\nAccording to Bauer, the ''Abwehr'' was more interested in perpetuating its own interests than it was in saving Jews.{{sfn|Bauer|1996|p=126}} While there are accounts of the ''Abwehr'' assisting Jews to safety via clandestinely arranged emigration,{{sfn|Roseman|2000|pp=129\u2013145, 250\u2013253}} there are also cases of ''Abwehr'' operatives enriching themselves in the process through bribes and other monetary payoffs.{{sfn|Roseman|2000|pp=137\u2013138}}{{efn|For more on the depths of corruption in Nazi Germany, see: Frank Bajohr, ''Parven\u00fcs und Profiteure: Korruption in der NS-Zeit''. Frankfurt: Fischer Verlag, 2001.}}\n\n===Undermining the regime===\nSeveral examples demonstrate that some ''Abwehr'' members were opposed to the Nazi regime. In January 1944 for example, American statesman [[John Foster Dulles]] revealed his knowledge of a coalescing resistance against the Nazis, an assemblage of intellectuals from military and government circles; his main contact was ''Abwehr'' officer [[Hans Bernd Gisevius]], who was stationed in Zurich as the German Vice Consul.{{sfn|Peterson|2002|p=281}} Dulles communicated with the ''Abwehr'' concerning their intrigue against Hitler and even attempted discussions about a separate peace, but President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] would have none of it, preferring instead a policy of unconditional surrender for the Nazi government.{{sfn|Peterson|2002|p=281}} Machinations against the National Socialists by the ''Abwehr'' were considerable in terms of the chain of command. General Oster of the ''Abwehr'' remained in regular contact with Dulles. Foreknowledge and penetration of the Abwehr was such that Dulles reported later in February 1944 that the ''Abwehr'' was going to be absorbed by the SD.{{sfn|Peterson|2002|p=281}}{{efn|Dulles was not the only one receiving reports from resistance groups. Efforts by dissident Germans to contact the Allies in Switzerland and elsewhere during 1944 are also documented in ''U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States'' (FRUS), 1944, vol. 1, General (Washington, DC, 1966), pp. 484-579.}}\n\nThe SS continually undermined the ''Abwehr'' by putting its officers under investigation, believing them to be involved in anti-Hitler plots. Heydrich ensured that the ''Abwehr'' and Canaris were closely monitored.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|p=226}} The SS also accused Canaris of being defeatist in his intelligence assessments, especially on the Russian campaign and the ''Abwehr'' was under investigation for treason related to the earlier attack on Belgrade.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\n===Eastern Front=== \nFollowing the launch of [[Operation Barbarossa]], an NKVD Soviet agent named Alexander Demyanov penetrated the ''Abwehr'' in late 1941 by posing as a member of a pro-German underground resistance with alleged access to the Soviet military leadership\u2014this was a complete fabrication concocted by the GRU and NKVD, who used Demyanov as a double agent.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=646}} During the Autumn of 1942, Demyanov informed his German handlers that he was working as a communications officer at the Soviet HQ in Moscow, which would give him access to important intelligence, a ruse that managed to fool the Nazi intelligence commander on the Russian front at the time, [[Reinhard Gehlen]].{{sfn|Andrew|2018|pp=646\u2013647}} Demyanov manipulated the military operations around Stalingrad, convincing Gehlen that Army Group Center would be unable to move west of Moscow to aide  General Friedrich Paulus and the Sixth Army, which was ultimately encircled by the Red Army.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=647}}\n\nLikewise, a group of White Russians under General Anton Turkul sought [[asylum in Germany]] and offered to provide radio intelligence for the Germans and worked with the ''Abwehr'' in getting the necessary communication links established. One of the primary radio links was code-named MAX, supposedly located near the Kremlin. MAX was not the intelligence mechanism the ''Abwehr'' believed it to be, instead, it was \"a creature of the [[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]]\" , through which information was regularly disseminated concerning Foreign Armies East and Foreign Air Forces East and troop movements. Careful message trafficking and deception operations by the Soviets allowed them to misdirect the Germans and aided in the strategic surprise they enjoyed against Army Group Center in June 1944.{{sfn|Richelson|1995|pp=143\u2013144}} Even though the ''Abwehr'' no longer existed at this point, the heritage operations connected to MAX gave the Soviet armies an advantage they would not have otherwise possessed and further prove the extent of damage attributable to the ''Abwehr's'' incompetence, as Moscow's disinformation repeatedly fooled the German high command.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|pp=234\u2013237}}\n\n==The Frau Solf Tea Party and the end of the Abwehr==\n{{Main|German Resistance|Frau Solf Tea Party|Erich Vermehren}}\nOn 10 September 1943, the incident which eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ''Abwehr'' occurred. The incident came to be known as the \"[[Frau Solf Tea Party]].\"\n\n[[Hanna Solf]] was the widow of Dr. [[Wilhelm Solf]], a former Colonial Minister under [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and ex-[[Ambassador]] to [[Japan]]. Frau Solf had long been involved in the [[German Resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi intellectual movement]] in Berlin.  Members of her group were known as members of the \"Solf Circle.\" At a tea party hosted by her on 10 September, a new member was included into the circle, a handsome young Swiss doctor named [[Paul Reckzeh]]. Dr. Reckzeh was an agent of the [[Gestapo]] (Secret State Police), to which he reported on the meeting, providing several incriminating documents. The members of the Solf Circle were all rounded up on 12 January 1944. Eventually everyone who was involved in the Solf Circle, except Frau Solf and her daughter (the Countess Lagi Gr\u00e4fin von Ballestrem), were executed.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1,025}}{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|pp=304\u2013306}}\n\nOne of those executed was [[Otto Kiep]], an official in the Foreign Office, who had friends in the ''Abwehr'', among whom were [[Erich Vermehren]] and his wife, the former Countess Elizabeth [[House of Plettenberg|von Plettenberg]], who were stationed as agents in [[Istanbul]]. Both were summoned to Berlin by the Gestapo in connection with the Kiep case. Fearing for their lives, they contacted the British and defected.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=306}}{{sfn|Bassett|2011|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nHitler had long suspected that the ''Abwehr'' had been infiltrated by anti-Nazi defectors and Allied agents, and the defection of Vemehren after the Solf Circle arrests all but confirmed it. It was also mistakenly believed in Berlin that the Vermehrens absconded with the secret codes of the ''Abwehr'' and turned them over to the British. That proved to be the last straw for Hitler. Despite the efforts of the ''Abwehr'' to shift the blame to the SS or even to the Foreign Ministry, Hitler had had enough of Canaris and he told Himmler so twice. He summoned the chief of the Abwehr for a final interview and accused him of allowing the ''Abwehr'' to \"fall to bits\". Canaris quietly agreed that it was \"not surprising\", as Germany was losing the war.{{sfn|Bassett|2011|p=282}}\n\nHitler fired Canaris on the spot, and on 18 February 1944, Hitler signed a decree that abolished the ''Abwehr''.{{efn|For a long time, Hitler had found the ''Abwehr'' suspect in terms of performance; they had not apprised the German military with any intelligence on the North African landings nor much thereafter,  leading him to conclude that the ''Abwehr'' and its leadership were basically incompetent. See: Waller (1996). ''The Unseen War in Europe: Espionage and Conspiracy in the Second World War'', pp. 330-331.}} Its functions were taken over by the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' or RSHA (Reich Main Security Office) and SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' and ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [Brigadier General] of Police Walter Schellenberg replaced Canaris functionally within the RSHA.  This action deprived the German Armed Forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') and the anti-Nazi conspirators of an intelligence service of its own and strengthened Himmler's control over the military.{{sfn|Cooper|1984|p=537}}\n\nCanaris was [[Cashiering|cashiered]] and given the empty title of Chief of the Office of Commercial and Economic Warfare. He was arrested on 23 July 1944, in the aftermath of the \"[[20 July Plot|July 20 Plot]]\" against Hitler and executed shortly before the end of the war, along with Oster, his deputy.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=698}} The functions of the ''Abwehr'' were then fully absorbed by ''Amt'' VI, ''[[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|SD-Ausland]]'', a sub-office of the RSHA, which was part of the SS.{{sfn|United States War Dept. General Staff|1984|p=3}}\n\n===The Zossen documents===\nDuring the war, the ''Abwehr'' assembled a secret dossier detailing many of the crimes committed in Eastern Europe by the Nazis, known as the Zossen documents. These files were gathered together with the intention of exposing the regime's crimes at a future date.{{sfn|McDonough|2005|p=44}} The documents were kept in a safe at the [[Maybach I and II|Zossen military headquarters]] not far from Berlin and remained under ''Abwehr'' control. Some of the papers were allegedly buried\u2014but the individual responsible for this ended up implicated in the [[20 July plot]] against Hitler and was executed. Later, the documents were discovered by the Gestapo and under the personal supervision of then SD Chief [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], they were taken to the castle Schloss Mittersill in the Tyrol and burned. Supposedly amid the Zossen documents was nothing less than the personal diary of Admiral Canaris, as well as the Vatican and Fritsch papers.{{sfn|Dulles|2000|p=73}}\n\n==Effectiveness and legacy==\nMany historians agree that, generally speaking, the ''Abwehr'' had a poor reputation for the quality of its work and its unusually decentralized organization.{{sfn|Leverkuehn|1954|p=37}}{{sfn|Howard|1990|p=49}} Some of the ''Abwehr's'' less than stellar image and performance was due to the intense rivalry it had with the SS, the RSHA and with the SD.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=251}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=2}} Other considerations for the failings of the ''Abwehr'' could have something to do with Allied success in deciphering the German [[Enigma machine]] ciphers, namely thanks to the code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]].{{sfn|Andrew|2018|pp=616\u2013617}} During the August and September 1942 engagements in North Africa against Rommel, this Allied capability was a crucial element to Montgomery's success, as British signals intelligence [[SIGINT]] was superior to that of the Germans.{{sfn|Andrew|2018|p=640, 644\u2013645}}\n\nAmerican historian [[Robin Winks]] says that the ''Abwehr'' was, \"an abysmal failure, failing to forecast [[Operation Torch|Torch]], or [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Husky]], or [[Operation Overlord|Overlord]].\"{{sfn|Winks|1996|p=281}} English historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] says it was, \"rotten with corruption, notoriously inefficient, [and] politically suspect.\" He adds that it was under the \"negligent rule\" of Admiral Canaris, who was \"more interested in anti-Nazi intrigue than in his official duties.\" Historian [[Norman Davies]] agrees with this observation and avows that Canaris \"was anything but a Nazi enthusiast\".{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=251}} According to Trevor-Roper, for the first two years of the war it was a \"happy parasite\" that was \"borne along...on the success of the German Army.\" When the tide turned against the Nazis and the ''Abwehr'' was unable to produce the intelligence the leadership demanded, it was merged into the SS in 1944.{{sfn|Trevor-Roper|1992|p=75}} Numerous intelligence failures and general incompetence led to catastrophic disasters in both the eastern and western campaigns for the German military.{{sfn|Archer|Ferris|Herwig|Travers|2002|pp=524\u2013525}}{{efn|One officer from the German General Staff during Operation Barbarossa described the ''Abwehr's'' intelligence contribution to the war effort as nothing more than ''Mist'', which is German for manure or dung.

Members of the ''Abwehr'' were important in helping lay the groundwork (along with the SD) for the ''Anschlu\u00df'' with Austria and during the annexation of Czechoslovakia, an ''Abwehr'' group also aided in the seizure of a strategically important railway tunnel in Polish-Silesia in the final week of August 1939.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=251}} Historian Walter Goerlitz claimed in his seminal work, ''History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945'', that Canaris and the ''Abwehr'' formed the \"real centre of military opposition to the regime\",{{sfn|Goerlitz|1985|p=295}} a view which many others do not share. Former OSS station chief and later director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Allen Dulles]], evaluated German intelligence officers from the ''Abwehr'' at the end of the war and concluded that only the upper echelons were active dissenters and part of the opposition movement. According to Dulles, the ''Abwehr'' participated in a lot more than just machinations against Hitler's regime and asserted that approximately 95 percent of the ''Abwehr'' actively worked \u201cagainst the Allies\u201d whereas only about 5 percent of them were anti-Nazi in disposition.{{sfn|Dulles|2000|pp=75\u201376}}  Military historian [[John Wheeler-Bennett]] wrote that the ''Abwehr'' \"failed conspicuously as a secret intelligence service\", that it was \"patently and incontestably inefficient\" and adds that members of the ''Abwehr'' \"displayed no great efficiency either as intelligence officers or as conspirators...\"{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1980|p=597}} Whatever successes the ''Abwehr'' enjoyed before the start of the Second World War, there were virtually none once the war began and worse, the British successfully ran 19 double agents through the Abwehr which fed them false information, duping the German intelligence service to the very end.{{sfn|Blandford|2001|pp=23\u201324}}{{efn|So thorough was the British penetration of German military intelligence, that not one single agent the ''Abwehr'' had in Great Britain was legitimate.

horse left by the departing Greeks.\"{{sfn|Kahn|1978|p=367}}}}{{efn|Attempts by the ''Abwehr'' to cencourage anti-colonial rebellion against the British Empire in Ireland (through contacts with the

Seaton makes an important observation regarding the German Army's failures as a result of poor intelligence by asserting that all too often, decisions were made as a result of the opinion of Hitler and that he imposed ''his'' views on the military chain of command and therewith, the choice of actions taken during the war.{{sfn|Seaton|1982|p=221}} Max Hastings makes similar claims about the general nature of totalitarians systems, where in Nazi Germany, intelligence assessments had to be adjusted within the constraints of what Hitler would accept.{{sfn|Hastings|2016|p=65}} Nonetheless,
