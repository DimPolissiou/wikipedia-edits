During a night of gambling in the basement-level gambling room, five Chinese men were killed [[execution-style]] by three [[Vietnam]]ese men. A sixth victim was seriously injured but survived.\n\nTwo of the perpetrators, Nam The Tham and Siny Van Tran, were convicted of murder in 2005 after a decade-long international manhunt led to their 2001 [[extradition]] from China to the United States via [[Hong Kong]]. Both Tran and Tham are serving life sentences in prison while the third suspect, Hung Tien has not yet been found as of 2017.\n\nWhile no motive has been officially established, initial police reports and later FBI investigations indicated that the [[Ping On]] gang and one of the victims were vying for power in Boston Chinatown.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible collapsed floatright\" style=\"font-size:85%;width:36em;\"\n|+People at the social club, Jan 11\u201312, 1991<ref name=\"bostonmagazine-2006\"/><ref name=460mass535/>\n|-style=\"font-size:110%;\"\n!

Even when heavily pregnant, she insisted on living inside his tent near the battlefield, making sure his clothing was clean and that he ate well after a battle, handling the day to day correspondence while he fought.

It describes a complex living system in the soil and how it interacts with the environment, plants, and animals.\n\n[[Food webs]] describe the transfer of energy between species in an [[ecosystem]].  While a [[food chain]] examines one, linear, energy pathway through an ecosystem, a food web is more complex and illustrates all of the potential pathways. Much of this transferred energy comes from the sun. Plants use the sun\u2019s energy to convert [[inorganic compound]]s into energy-rich, [[organic compound]]s, turning carbon dioxide and minerals into plant material by [[photosynthesis]]. Plant flowers [[Exudate#Plant exudates|exude]] energy-rich [[nectar]] above ground and plant roots exude acids, sugars, and ectoenzymes into the [[rhizosphere]], adjusting the [[pH]] and feeding the food web underground.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants |last1= Marschner|first1=Horst |year= 1995  |isbn=978-0124735439 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = T.

[[Heterotroph]]s are consumers that cannot make their own food. In order to obtain energy they eat plants or other heterotrophs.\n\n== Above ground food webs ==\n\nIn above ground food webs, energy moves from producers (plants) to primary consumers ([[herbivore]]s) and then to secondary consumers (predators). The phrase, [[trophic level]], refers to the different levels or steps in the energy pathway. In other words, the producers, consumers, and decomposers are the main trophic levels. This chain of energy transferring from one species to another can continue several more times, but eventually ends. At the end of the food chain, decomposers such as bacteria and fungi break down dead plant and animal material into simple nutrients.\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe nature of soil makes direct observation of food webs difficult. Since soil organisms range in size from less than 0.1&nbsp;mm (nematodes) to greater than 2&nbsp;mm (earthworms) there are many different ways to extract them. Soil samples are often taken using a metal core. Larger macrofauna such as [[earthworm]]s and insect [[larva]] can be removed by hand, but this is impossible for smaller nematodes and soil arthropods. Most methods to extract small organisms are dynamic; they depend on the ability of the organisms to move out of the soil. For example, a [[Antonio Berlese|Berlese funnel]], used to collect small [[arthropod]]s, creates a light/heat gradient in the soil sample. As the microarthropods move down, away from the light and heat, they fall through a funnel and into a collection vial. A similar method, the Baermann funnel, is used for nematodes. The Baerman funnel is wet, however (while the Berlese funnel is dry) and does not depend on a light/heat gradient. Nematodes move out of the soil and to the bottom of the funnel because, as they move, they are denser than water and are unable to swim. Soil microbial communities are characterized in many different ways. The activity of microbes can be measured by their respiration and carbon dioxide release. The cellular components of microbes can be extracted from soil and genetically profiled, or microbial biomass can be calculated by weighing the soil before and after fumigation.\n\n== Types of food webs ==\n[[File:Indirect interaction.png|thumb|right|An example of a soil interaction web. Image courtesy of Kalessin11.]]\n\nThere are three different types of food web representations: topological (or traditional) food webs, flow webs and interaction webs. These webs can describe systems both above and below ground.\n\n=== Topological webs ===\nEarly food webs were topological; they were descriptive and provided a nonquantitative picture of consumers, resources and the links between them. Pimm ''et al.'' (1991) described these webs as a map of which organisms in a community eat which other kinds. The earliest topological food web, made in 1912, examined the predators and parasites of cotton [[boll weevil]] (reviewed by Pimm ''et al.'' 1991).

Hunt ''et al.'' (1987) published the first flow web for soil, describing the short grass [[prairie]] in Colorado, USA. The authors estimated nitrogen transferral rates through the soil food web and calculated nitrogen mineralization rates for a range of soil organisms. In another landmark study, researchers from the Lovinkhoeve Experimental Farm in the Netherlands examined the flow of [[carbon]] and illustrated transfer rates with arrows of different thicknesses.<ref name=Brussaard >{{citation |year=1988 |title=The Dutch Programme on soil ecology of arable farming systems I.

Lebbink }}</ref>\n\nIn order to create a flow web, a topological web is first constructed. After the members of the web are decided, the [[biomass]] of each functional group is calculated, usually in kg carbon/[[hectare]]. In order to calculate feeding rates, researchers assume that the population of the functional group is in equilibrium. At equilibrium, the reproduction of the group balances the rate at which members are lost through natural death and predation<ref name=Hunt>{{citation |year=1987 |title=The detrital food web in a shortgrass prairie |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=3 |pages=57\u201368 |author=Hunt, H.W., D.C.

Morley }}</ref> When feeding rate is known, the efficiency with which nutrients are converted into organism biomass can be calculated. This energy stored in the organism represents the amount available to be passed on to the next trophic level.\n\nAfter constructing the first soil flow webs, researchers discovered that nutrients and energy flowed from lower resources to higher trophic levels through three main channels.<ref name=Brussaard /><ref name=Hunt /> The bacterial and fungal channels had the largest energy flow, while the herbivory channel, in which organisms directly consumed plant roots, was smaller. It is now widely recognized that bacteria and fungi are critical to the decomposition of carbon and nitrogen and play important roles in both the [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]].\n\n=== Interaction web ===\nAn interaction web, shown above right,<ref>[[USDA]]-NRCS, 2004, [http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/concepts/soil_biology/soil_food_web.html \"The Soil Food web\"] in ''The Soil Biology Primer''.  Url accessed 2006\u201304-11</ref> is similar to a topological web, but instead of showing the movement of energy or materials, the arrows show how one group influences another. In interaction food web models, every link has two direct effects, one of the resource on the consumer and one of the consumer on the resource.<ref name=Stiling1999>{{citation |last=Stiling |first=P. |year=1999 |title=Ecology, Theories and Applications. Third Edtn |publisher=Prentice Hall. New Jersey USA. }}</ref> The effect of the resource on the consumer is positive, (the consumer gets to eat) and the effect on the resource by the consumer is negative (it is eaten). These direct, trophic, effects can lead to indirect effects. Indirect effects, represented by dashed lines, show the effect of one element on another to which it is not directly linked.<ref name=Stiling1999 /> For example, in the simple interaction web below, when the predator eats the root herbivore, the plant eaten by the herbivore may increase in biomass. We would then say that the predator has a beneficial indirect effect on the plant roots.\n\n== Food web control ==\n\n=== Bottom-up effects ===\nBottom-up effects occur when the density of a resource affects the density of its consumer.<ref name=Shurin>{{citation |year=2006 |title=All wet or dried up? Real differences between aquatic and terrestrial food webs |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=273 |pages=1\u20139 |author=Shurin, J.B., D.S. Gruner, and H. Hillebrand |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3377 |issue=1582 |pmid=16519227 |pmc=1560001}}</ref> For example, in the figure above, an increase in root density causes an increase in herbivore density that causes a corresponding increase in predator density. [[Correlations]] in abundance or biomass between consumers and their resources give evidence for bottom-up control.<ref name=Shurin /> An often-cited example of a bottom-up effect is the relationship between herbivores and the [[primary productivity]] of plants. In terrestrial ecosystems, the [[biomass]] of herbivores and [[detritivore]]s increases with primary productivity. An increase in primary productivity will result in a larger influx of leaf litter into the soil ecosystem, which will provide more resources for bacterial and fungal populations to grow. More microbes will allow an increase in bacterial and fungal feeding [[nematodes]], which are eaten by mites and other predatory nematodes. Thus, the entire food web swells as more resources are added to the base.<ref name=Shurin />  When ecologists use the term, bottom-up control, they are indicating that the biomass, abundance, or diversity of higher trophic levels depend on resources from lower trophic levels.<ref name=Stiling1999 />\n\n=== Top-down effects ===\nIdeas about top-down control are much more difficult to evaluate. Top-down effects occur when the population density of a consumer affects that of its resource;<ref name=Stiling1999 /> for example, a predator affects the density of its prey. Top-down control, therefore, refers to situations where the abundance, diversity or biomass of lower trophic levels depends on effects from consumers at higher trophic levels.<ref name=Stiling1999 /> A [[trophic cascade]] is a type of top-down interaction that describes the indirect effects of predators. In a trophic cascade, predators induce effects that cascade down food chain and affect biomass of organisms at least two links away.<ref name=Stiling1999 />\n\nThe importance of trophic cascades and top-down control in terrestrial ecosystems is actively debated in ecology (reviewed in Shurin ''et al.'' 2006) and the issue of whether trophic cascades occur in soils is no less complex<ref name=Wardle>{{citation |last=Wardle |first=D.A |year=2002 |title=Communities and Ecosystems: Linking the aboveground and belowground components ''Monographs in population biology'' |volume=31 |publisher=Princeton University Press.

This [[compensatory growth]] slowed when the microbe feeding nematodes were removed. Therefore, although top predators reduced the number of microbe feeding nematodes, there was no overall change in microbial biomass.\n\nBesides the grazing effect, another barrier to top down control in soil ecosystems is widespread omnivory, which by increasing the number of trophic interactions, dampens effects from the top. The soil environment is also a matrix of different temperatures, moistures and nutrient levels, and many organisms are able to become dormant to withstand difficult times. Depending on conditions, predators may be separated from their potential prey by an insurmountable amount of space and time.\n\nAny top-down effects that do occur will be limited in strength because soil food webs are donor controlled. Donor control means that consumers have little or no effect on the renewal or input of their resources.<ref name=Stiling1999 /> For example, aboveground herbivores can overgraze an area and decrease the grass population, but decomposers cannot directly influence the rate of falling plant litter. They can only indirectly influence the rate of input into their system through nutrient recycling which, by helping plants to grow, eventually creates more litter and detritus to fall.<ref>{{citation |year=2003 |title=Top down is bottom up: does predation in the rhizosphere regulate aboveground dynamics? |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |pages=846\u2013857 |author=Moore, J.C., K.

Certain predators or parasites, when added to the soil, can have a large effect on root herbivores and thereby indirectly affect plant fitness. For example, in a coastal shrubland food chain the native [[entomopathogenic nematode]], ''Heterorhabditis marelatus'', parasitized ghost moth caterpillars, and ghost moth caterpillars consumed the roots of bush lupine. The presence of ''H. marelatus'' correlated with lower caterpillar numbers and healthier plants. In addition, the researchers observed high mortality of bush lupine in the absence of entomopathogenic nematodes. These results implied that the nematode, as a natural enemy of the ghost moth caterpillar, protected the plant from damage. The authors even suggested that the interaction was strong enough to affect the population dynamics of bush lupine;<ref>{{citation |year=1996 |title=Entomopathogenic nematodes: natural enemies of root-feeding caterpillars on bush lupine |journal=Oecologia (Berlin) |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=167\u2013173 |author=Strong, D.

While wasps and ladybugs are commonly associated with biological control, parasitic nematodes and predatory mites are also added to the soil to suppress pest populations and preserve crop plants. In order to use such biological control agents effectively, a knowledge of the local soil food web is important.\n\n== Community matrix models ==\nA [[community matrix]] model is a type of interaction web that uses differential equations to describe every link in the topological web. Using [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation]]s, that describe predator-prey interactions, and food web energetics data such as biomass and feeding rate, the strength of interactions between groups is calculated.<ref name=\"de Ruiter1995\">{{citation |year=1995 |title=Energetics, patterns of interaction strengths, and stability in real ecosystems |journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |volume=269 |pages=1257\u20131260 |bibcode=1995Sci...269.1257D |author=de Ruiter, P.C., Neutel, A.-M., & Moore, J.C. |last2=Neutel |last3=Moore |doi=10.1126/science.269.5228.1257 |pmid=17732112 |issue=5228 }}</ref> Community matrix models can also show how small changes affect the overall stability of the web.\n\n== Stability of food webs ==\nMathematical modeling in food webs has raised the question of whether complex or simple food webs are more stable. Until the last decade, it was believed that soil food webs were relatively simple, with low degrees of connectance and omnivory.<ref name=Wardle /> These ideas stemmed from the mathematical models of May which predicted that complexity destabilized food webs. May used community matrices in which species were randomly linked with random interaction strength to show that local stability decreases with complexity (measured as connectance), diversity, and average interaction strength among species.<ref name=May>{{citation |last=May |first=R.M |year=1973 |title=Stability and complexity in model ecosystems |journal=Monographs in Population Biology |volume=6 |pages=1\u2013235 |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press.

Complex food webs may be more stable if the interaction strengths are weak<ref name=May /> and soil food webs appear to consist of many weak interactions and a few strong ones.<ref name=\"de Ruiter1995\" /> Donor controlled food webs may be inherently more stable, because it is difficult for primary consumers to overtax their resources.<ref name=\"De Angelis\">{{citation |last=De Angelis |first=D.L. |year=1992 |title=Dynamics of nutrient cycling and food webs |publisher=Chapman and Hall.

Litter transformers, mutualists, and ecosystem engineers all have strong impacts on their communities that cannot be characterized as either top-down or bottom-up.\n\nLitter transformers, such as [[isopod]]s, consume dead plants and excrete fecal pellets. While on the surface this may not seem impressive, the fecal pellets are moister and higher in nutrients than the surrounding soil, which favors colonization by bacteria and fungi. Decomposition of the fecal pellet by the microbes increases its nutrient value and the isopod is able to re-ingest the pellets. When the isopods consume nutrient-poor litter, the microbes enrich it for them and isopods prevented from eating their own feces can die.<ref name=Hassall>{{citation |year=1982 |title=The role of coprophagy in the feeding strategies of terrestrial isopods |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=53 |pages=374\u2013381 |author=Hassall, M., S.P.

Earthworms also stimulate microbial activity by increasing soil aeration and moisture, and transporting litter into the ground where it becomes available to other soil fauna.<ref name=Wardle />  Fungi create nutritional niche for other organisms by enriching nutritionally extremely scarce food - the dead wood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Micha\u0142|last2=Sobczyk|first2=\u0141ukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013|pmc=4931425}}</ref> This allows [[Xylophagy|xylophages]] to develop and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Micha\u0142|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2016-09-01|title=Nutritional dynamics during the development of xylophagous beetles related to changes in the stoichiometry of 11 elements|journal=Physiological Entomology|volume=42|language=en|pages=73\u201384|doi=10.1111/phen.12168|issn=1365-3032|doi-access=free}}</ref> In aboveground and aquatic food webs, the literature assumes that the most important interactions are competition and predation. While soil food webs fit these sorts of interactions well, future research needs to include more complex interactions such as mutualisms and habitat modification.\n\nWhile they cannot characterize all interactions, soil food webs remain a useful tool for describing ecosystems. The interactions between species in the soil and their effect on decomposition continue to be well studied. Much remains unknown, however, about soil food webs stability and how food webs change over time.<ref name=Wardle />  This knowledge is critical to understanding how food webs affect important qualities such as [[soil fertility]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Soil biology]]\n*[[Soil ecology]]\n*[[Soil functions]]\n*[[Soil life]]\n*[[Trophic cascade]]\n*[[Food web]]\n*[[Entomopathogenic nematode]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.soilfoodweb.ca Soil Foodweb Laboratory in Canada]\n*[http://www.soilfoodweb.com Soil Foodweb Inc] international network of soil analysis laboratories and education providers\n\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n{{soil science topics}}\n\n[[Category:Soil biology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:soil food webUSDA.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An example of a topological food web (image courtesy of [[USDA]])<ref name=\"USDA-SoilPrimerGallery\">{{cite web|title=Soil Biology Primer Photo Gallery|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/photogallery/soils/health/biology/gallery/?cid=1788&position=Promo|website=Natural Resources Conservation Service - Soils|publisher=Soil and Water Conservation Society, U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nThe '''soil food web''' is the community of organisms living all or part of their lives in the soil.

While a [[food chain]] examines one, linear, energy pathway through an ecosystem, a food web is more complex and illustrates all of the potential pathways. Much of this transferred energy comes from the sun. Plants use the sun\u2019s energy to convert [[inorganic compound]]s into energy-rich, [[organic compound]]s, turning carbon dioxide and minerals into plant material by [[photosynthesis]].

[[Heterotroph]]s are consumers that cannot make their own food. In order to obtain energy they eat plants or other heterotrophs.\n\n== Above ground food webs ==\n\nIn above ground food webs, energy moves from producers (plants) to primary consumers ([[herbivore]]s) and then to secondary consumers (predators). The phrase, [[trophic level]], refers to the different levels or steps in the energy pathway. In other words, the producers, consumers, and decomposers are the main trophic levels. This chain of energy transferring from one species to another can continue several more times, but eventually ends. At the end of the food chain, decomposers such as bacteria and fungi break down dead plant and animal material into simple nutrients.\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe nature of soil makes direct observation of food webs difficult. Since soil organisms range in size from less than 0.1&nbsp;mm (nematodes) to greater than 2&nbsp;mm (earthworms) there are many different ways to extract them. Soil samples are often taken using a metal core. Larger macrofauna such as [[earthworm]]s and insect [[larva]] can be removed by hand, but this is impossible for smaller nematodes and soil arthropods. Most methods to extract small organisms are dynamic; they depend on the ability of the organisms to move out of the soil. For example, a [[Antonio Berlese|Berlese funnel]], used to collect small [[arthropod]]s, creates a light/heat gradient in the soil sample. As the microarthropods move down, away from the light and heat, they fall through a funnel and into a collection vial. A similar method, the Baermann funnel, is used for nematodes. The Baerman funnel is wet, however (while the Berlese funnel is dry) and does not depend on a light/heat gradient. Nematodes move out of the soil and to the bottom of the funnel because, as they move, they are denser than water and are unable to swim. Soil microbial communities are characterized in many different ways. The activity of microbes can be measured by their respiration and carbon dioxide release. The cellular components of microbes can be extracted from soil and genetically profiled, or microbial biomass can be calculated by weighing the soil before and after fumigation.\n\n== Types of food webs ==\n[[File:Indirect interaction.png|thumb|right|An example of a soil interaction web.

The authors estimated nitrogen transferral rates through the soil food web and calculated nitrogen mineralization rates for a range of soil organisms. In another landmark study, researchers from the Lovinkhoeve Experimental Farm in the Netherlands examined the flow of [[carbon]] and illustrated transfer rates with arrows of different thicknesses.<ref name=Brussaard >{{citation |year=1988 |title=The Dutch Programme on soil ecology of arable farming systems I.

Lebbink }}</ref>\n\nIn order to create a flow web, a topological web is first constructed. After the members of the web are decided, the [[biomass]] of each functional group is calculated, usually in kg carbon/[[hectare]]. In order to calculate feeding rates, researchers assume that the population of the functional group is in equilibrium. At equilibrium, the reproduction of the group balances the rate at which members are lost through natural death and predation<ref name=Hunt>{{citation |year=1987 |title=The detrital food web in a shortgrass prairie |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=3 |pages=57\u201368 |author=Hunt, H.W., D.C.

Morley }}</ref> When feeding rate is known, the efficiency with which nutrients are converted into organism biomass can be calculated. This energy stored in the organism represents the amount available to be passed on to the next trophic level.\n\nAfter constructing the first soil flow webs, researchers discovered that nutrients and energy flowed from lower resources to higher trophic levels through three main channels.<ref name=Brussaard /><ref name=Hunt /> The bacterial and fungal channels had the largest energy flow, while the herbivory channel, in which organisms directly consumed plant roots, was smaller. It is now widely recognized that bacteria and fungi are critical to the decomposition of carbon and nitrogen and play important roles in both the [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]].\n\n=== Interaction web ===\nAn interaction web, shown above right,<ref>[[USDA]]-NRCS, 2004, [http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/concepts/soil_biology/soil_food_web.html \"The Soil Food web\"] in ''The Soil Biology Primer''.  Url accessed 2006\u201304-11</ref> is similar to a topological web, but instead of showing the movement of energy or materials, the arrows show how one group influences another. In interaction food web models, every link has two direct effects, one of the resource on the consumer and one of the consumer on the resource.<ref name=Stiling1999>{{citation |last=Stiling |first=P. |year=1999 |title=Ecology, Theories and Applications. Third Edtn |publisher=Prentice Hall. New Jersey USA. }}</ref> The effect of the resource on the consumer is positive, (the consumer gets to eat) and the effect on the resource by the consumer is negative (it is eaten). These direct, trophic, effects can lead to indirect effects. Indirect effects, represented by dashed lines, show the effect of one element on another to which it is not directly linked.<ref name=Stiling1999 /> For example, in the simple interaction web below, when the predator eats the root herbivore, the plant eaten by the herbivore may increase in biomass. We would then say that the predator has a beneficial indirect effect on the plant roots.\n\n== Food web control ==\n\n=== Bottom-up effects ===\nBottom-up effects occur when the density of a resource affects the density of its consumer.<ref name=Shurin>{{citation |year=2006 |title=All wet or dried up? Real differences between aquatic and terrestrial food webs |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=273 |pages=1\u20139 |author=Shurin, J.B., D.S. Gruner, and H. Hillebrand |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3377 |issue=1582 |pmid=16519227 |pmc=1560001}}</ref> For example, in the figure above, an increase in root density causes an increase in herbivore density that causes a corresponding increase in predator density. [[Correlations]] in abundance or biomass between consumers and their resources give evidence for bottom-up control.<ref name=Shurin /> An often-cited example of a bottom-up effect is the relationship between herbivores and the [[primary productivity]] of plants. In terrestrial ecosystems, the [[biomass]] of herbivores and [[detritivore]]s increases with primary productivity. An increase in primary productivity will result in a larger influx of leaf litter into the soil ecosystem, which will provide more resources for bacterial and fungal populations to grow. More microbes will allow an increase in bacterial and fungal feeding [[nematodes]], which are eaten by mites and other predatory nematodes. Thus, the entire food web swells as more resources are added to the base.<ref name=Shurin />  When ecologists use the term, bottom-up control, they are indicating that the biomass, abundance, or diversity of higher trophic levels depend on resources from lower trophic levels.<ref name=Stiling1999 />\n\n=== Top-down effects ===\nIdeas about top-down control are much more difficult to evaluate. Top-down effects occur when the population density of a consumer affects that of its resource;<ref name=Stiling1999 /> for example, a predator affects the density of its prey. Top-down control, therefore, refers to situations where the abundance, diversity or biomass of lower trophic levels depends on effects from consumers at higher trophic levels.<ref name=Stiling1999 /> A [[trophic cascade]] is a type of top-down interaction that describes the indirect effects of predators. In a trophic cascade, predators induce effects that cascade down food chain and affect biomass of organisms at least two links away.<ref name=Stiling1999 />\n\nThe importance of trophic cascades and top-down control in terrestrial ecosystems is actively debated in ecology (reviewed in Shurin ''et al.'' 2006) and the issue of whether trophic cascades occur in soils is no less complex<ref name=Wardle>{{citation |last=Wardle |first=D.A |year=2002 |title=Communities and Ecosystems: Linking the aboveground and belowground components ''Monographs in population biology'' |volume=31 |publisher=Princeton University Press.

This [[compensatory growth]] slowed when the microbe feeding nematodes were removed. Therefore, although top predators reduced the number of microbe feeding nematodes, there was no overall change in microbial biomass.\n\nBesides the grazing effect, another barrier to top down control in soil ecosystems is widespread omnivory, which by increasing the number of trophic interactions, dampens effects from the top. The soil environment is also a matrix of different temperatures, moistures and nutrient levels, and many organisms are able to become dormant to withstand difficult times. Depending on conditions, predators may be separated from their potential prey by an insurmountable amount of space and time.\n\nAny top-down effects that do occur will be limited in strength because soil food webs are donor controlled. Donor control means that consumers have little or no effect on the renewal or input of their resources.<ref name=Stiling1999 /> For example, aboveground herbivores can overgraze an area and decrease the grass population, but decomposers cannot directly influence the rate of falling plant litter. They can only indirectly influence the rate of input into their system through nutrient recycling which, by helping plants to grow, eventually creates more litter and detritus to fall.<ref>{{citation |year=2003 |title=Top down is bottom up: does predation in the rhizosphere regulate aboveground dynamics? |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |pages=846\u2013857 |author=Moore, J.C., K.

Certain predators or parasites, when added to the soil, can have a large effect on root herbivores and thereby indirectly affect plant fitness. For example, in a coastal shrubland food chain the native [[entomopathogenic nematode]], ''Heterorhabditis marelatus'', parasitized ghost moth caterpillars, and ghost moth caterpillars consumed the roots of bush lupine. The presence of ''H. marelatus'' correlated with lower caterpillar numbers and healthier plants. In addition, the researchers observed high mortality of bush lupine in the absence of entomopathogenic nematodes. These results implied that the nematode, as a natural enemy of the ghost moth caterpillar, protected the plant from damage. The authors even suggested that the interaction was strong enough to affect the population dynamics of bush lupine;<ref>{{citation |year=1996 |title=Entomopathogenic nematodes: natural enemies of root-feeding caterpillars on bush lupine |journal=Oecologia (Berlin) |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=167\u2013173 |author=Strong, D.

While wasps and ladybugs are commonly associated with biological control, parasitic nematodes and predatory mites are also added to the soil to suppress pest populations and preserve crop plants. In order to use such biological control agents effectively, a knowledge of the local soil food web is important.\n\n== Community matrix models ==\nA [[community matrix]] model is a type of interaction web that uses differential equations to describe every link in the topological web. Using [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation]]s, that describe predator-prey interactions, and food web energetics data such as biomass and feeding rate, the strength of interactions between groups is calculated.<ref name=\"de Ruiter1995\">{{citation |year=1995 |title=Energetics, patterns of interaction strengths, and stability in real ecosystems |journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |volume=269 |pages=1257\u20131260 |bibcode=1995Sci...269.1257D |author=de Ruiter, P.C., Neutel, A.-M., & Moore, J.C. |last2=Neutel |last3=Moore |doi=10.1126/science.269.5228.1257 |pmid=17732112 |issue=5228 }}</ref> Community matrix models can also show how small changes affect the overall stability of the web.\n\n== Stability of food webs ==\nMathematical modeling in food webs has raised the question of whether complex or simple food webs are more stable. Until the last decade, it was believed that soil food webs were relatively simple, with low degrees of connectance and omnivory.<ref name=Wardle /> These ideas stemmed from the mathematical models of May which predicted that complexity destabilized food webs. May used community matrices in which species were randomly linked with random interaction strength to show that local stability decreases with complexity (measured as connectance), diversity, and average interaction strength among species.<ref name=May>{{citation |last=May |first=R.M |year=1973 |title=Stability and complexity in model ecosystems |journal=Monographs in Population Biology |volume=6 |pages=1\u2013235 |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press.

Many of the barriers to top-down trophic cascades also promote stability. Complex food webs may be more stable if the interaction strengths are weak<ref name=May /> and soil food webs appear to consist of many weak interactions and a few strong ones.<ref name=\"de Ruiter1995\" /> Donor controlled food webs may be inherently more stable, because it is difficult for primary consumers to overtax their resources.<ref name=\"De Angelis\">{{citation |last=De Angelis |first=D.L. |year=1992 |title=Dynamics of nutrient cycling and food webs |publisher=Chapman and Hall.

Litter transformers, mutualists, and ecosystem engineers all have strong impacts on their communities that cannot be characterized as either top-down or bottom-up.\n\nLitter transformers, such as [[isopod]]s, consume dead plants and excrete fecal pellets. While on the surface this may not seem impressive, the fecal pellets are moister and higher in nutrients than the surrounding soil, which favors colonization by bacteria and fungi. Decomposition of the fecal pellet by the microbes increases its nutrient value and the isopod is able to re-ingest the pellets. When the isopods consume nutrient-poor litter, the microbes enrich it for them and isopods prevented from eating their own feces can die.<ref name=Hassall>{{citation |year=1982 |title=The role of coprophagy in the feeding strategies of terrestrial isopods |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=53 |pages=374\u2013381 |author=Hassall, M., S.P.

While soil food webs fit these sorts of interactions well, future research needs to include more complex interactions such as mutualisms and habitat modification.\n\nWhile they cannot characterize all interactions, soil food webs remain a useful tool for describing ecosystems. The interactions between species in the soil and their effect on decomposition continue to be well studied. Much remains unknown, however, about soil food webs stability and how food webs change over time.<ref name=Wardle />  This knowledge is critical to understanding how food webs affect important qualities such as [[soil fertility]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Soil biology]]\n*[[Soil ecology]]\n*[[Soil functions]]\n*[[Soil life]]\n*[[Trophic cascade]]\n*[[Food web]]\n*[[Entomopathogenic nematode]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.soilfoodweb.ca Soil Foodweb Laboratory in Canada]\n*[http://www.soilfoodweb.com Soil Foodweb Inc] international network of soil analysis laboratories and education providers\n\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n{{soil science topics}}\n\n[[Category:Soil biology]]\n", "name_user": "Lollipoplollipoplollipop", "label": "safe", "comment": "extremelly -> extremely", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_food_web"}
