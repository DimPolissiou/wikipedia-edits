The key to the method is to deliberately connect workers' non-workplace issues to their relationships in their families and communities. Union members draw on their relationships to their own churches and faith-based institutions, sports clubs, social groups of all kinds, and help carry success on a broad range of issues from the workplace into their own communities and local politics. \n\nFrom the AFL-CIO she was recruited to become the national Deputy Director for Strategic Campaigns of the Health Care Division of the [[SEIU]] (2002 to 2004). From there she was hired by SEIU Nevada, a statewide union, as their Executive Director and Chief Negotiator in 2004. From 2004 to 2006, the Nevada local had more hospital organizing wins than any other SEIU local. The Nevada local also reached the highest membership level in a right to work state in the history of the SEIU (more than 70% union wide), leading to unprecedented success in Nevada including achieving fully employer-paid family healthcare, preventing the rollback of public pensions, stopping and in some cases reversing two-tier collective bargaining agreements, and using an approach to contract negotiations that gives every worker the right to sit in on their workplace negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coolican|first=Patrick|title=New face of labor has heart, drive|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/dec/10/new-face-of-labor-has-heart-drive/|date=December 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her career at SEIU, McAlevey completed a doctorate in [[sociology]] at the Graduate Center, CUNY under the supervision of [[Frances Fox Piven]].<ref name=\"diss\">{{cite thesis |last=McAlevey |first=Jane F. |date=2015 |title=No Shortcuts: A Case for Organizing |type=PhD |page=iii |publisher=Graduate Center, CUNY |docket= |oclc= 949906889 |id={{ProQuest|1689441854}} }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Raising Expectations and Raising Hell, My Decade Fighting for the Labor Movement'', {{ISBN|9781781683156}}, published by Verso in 2012.\n*''[[No Shortcuts|No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age]]'', {{ISBN|9780190624712}}, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2016.\n*''[[A Collective Bargain: Unions, Organizing, and the Fight for Democracy]]'', {{ISBN|9780062908599}}, published by [[Ecco Press]] in 2020.<ref name=\"ClimateJobs2020\">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Alleen |title=The Climate Movement Doesn\u2019t Know How to Talk With Union Members About Green Jobs |url=https://theintercept.com/2020/03/09/climate-labor-movements-unions-green-new-deal/ |accessdate=12 March 2020 |work=The Intercept |date=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://janemcalevey.com/ (Official Website)]\n* [https://www.thenation.com/authors/jane-mcalevey-0 Jane McAlevey's Page on ''The Nation'']\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McAlevey, Jane}}\n[[Category:American trade unionists]]\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University at Buffalo alumni]]\n[[Category:Graduate Center, CUNY alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| image         = Jane McAlevey Head Shot for Use.jpg\n| caption       = Jane McAlevey c. 2014 \n| alt           = Jane McAlevey Head Shot\n| name          = Jane Frances McAlevey\n| birth_date    = {{birth date and age|1964|10|12|mf=y}}\n| birth_place   = [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], U.S.\n| residence     = San Francisco Bay Area and NYC \n| nationality   = [[United States|American]]\n| ethnicity     = \n| citizenship   = \n| other_names   = \n| known_for     = \n| education     = [[State University of New York at Buffalo]] <small>(B.A.)</small><br />[[Graduate Center, CUNY]] <small>(Ph.D.)</small> <br />[[Harvard Law School]] <small>(Post Doc)</small> \n| alma_mater    = \n| employer      = \n| occupation    = union, environmental and community organizer, scholar, author, political commentator\n| years_active  = 1984&ndash;present\n| home_town     = \n| party         = \n| opponents     = \n| boards        = \n| religion      = \n| spouse        =  \n| children      =  \n| relatives     = \n| website       = {{url| janemcalevey.com }}\n| footnotes     = \n}}\n'''Jane F.

The key to the method is to deliberately connect workers' non-workplace issues to their relationships in their families and communities. Union members draw on their relationships to their own churches and faith-based institutions, sports clubs, social groups of all kinds, and help carry success on a broad range of issues from the workplace into their own communities and local politics. \n\nFrom the AFL-CIO she was recruited to become the national Deputy Director for Strategic Campaigns of the Health Care Division of the [[SEIU]] (2002 to 2004). From there she was hired by SEIU Nevada, a statewide union, as their Executive Director and Chief Negotiator in 2004. From 2004 to 2006, the Nevada local had more hospital organizing wins than any other SEIU local. The Nevada local also reached the highest membership level in a right to work state in the history of the SEIU (more than 70% union wide), leading to unprecedented success in Nevada including achieving fully employer-paid family healthcare, preventing the rollback of public pensions, stopping and in some cases reversing two-tier collective bargaining agreements, and using an approach to contract negotiations that gives every worker the right to sit in on their workplace negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coolican|first=Patrick|title=New face of labor has heart, drive|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/dec/10/new-face-of-labor-has-heart-drive/|date=December 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her career at SEIU, McAlevey completed a doctorate in [[sociology]] at the Graduate Center, CUNY under the supervision of [[Frances Fox Piven]].<ref name=\"diss\">{{cite thesis |last=McAlevey |first=Jane F. |date=2015 |title=No Shortcuts: A Case for Organizing |type=PhD |page=iii |publisher=Graduate Center, CUNY |docket= |oclc= 949906889 |id={{ProQuest|1689441854}} }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Raising Expectations and Raising Hell, My Decade Fighting for the Labor Movement'', {{ISBN|9781781683156}}, published by Verso in 2012.\n*''[[No Shortcuts|No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age]]'', {{ISBN|9780190624712}}, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2016.\n*''[[A Collective Bargain: Unions, Organizing, and the Fight for Democracy]]'', {{ISBN|9780062908599}}, published by [[Ecco Press]] in 2020.<ref name=\"ClimateJobs2020\">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Alleen |title=The Climate Movement Doesn\u2019t Know How to Talk With Union Members About Green Jobs |url=https://theintercept.com/2020/03/09/climate-labor-movements-unions-green-new-deal/ |accessdate=12 March 2020 |work=The Intercept |date=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://janemcalevey.com/ (Official Website)]\n* [https://www.thenation.com/authors/jane-mcalevey-0 Jane McAlevey's Page on ''The Nation'']\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McAlevey, Jane}}\n[[Category:American trade unionists]]\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University at Buffalo alumni]]\n[[Category:Graduate Center, CUNY alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Mapmaker345", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McAlevey"}
