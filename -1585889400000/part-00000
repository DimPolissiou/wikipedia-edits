Additionally, ASMR is often triggered by exposure to specific audio and video. Such media may be specially made with the specific purpose of triggering ASMR or originally created for other purposes and later discovered to be effective as a trigger of the experience.<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/>\n\n[[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] that can trigger ASMR, as reported by those who experience it, include the following:\n* Listening to a softly spoken or whispering voice\n* Listening to quiet, repetitive sounds resulting from someone engaging in a mundane task such as turning the pages of a book\n* Watching somebody attentively execute a mundane task such as preparing food\n* Loudly chewing, crunching, slurping or biting foods, drinks, or gum\n* Receiving personal attention\n* Initiating the stimulus through conscious manipulation without the need for external video or audio triggers\n* Listening to tapping, typically nails onto surfaces such as plastic, wood, metal, etc.\n* Hand movements, especially onto one's face\n* Listening to certain types of music\n* Listening to a person blow or exhale into a microphone\n\nA 2017 study of 130 survey respondents found that lower-pitched, complex sounds, and slow-paced, detail-focused videos are especially effective triggers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barratt |first1=EL |last2=Spence |first2=C |last3=Davis |first3=NJ |title=Sensory determinants of the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR): understanding the triggers. |journal=PeerJ |date=2017 |volume=5 |pages=e3846 |doi=10.7717/peerj.3846 |pmid=29018601 |pmc=5633022}}</ref>\n\n===Whispering===\nPsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that whispering was an effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects who took part in an experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR;<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/> this statistic is reflected in the popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking in a whispered voice.<ref name=\"Manduley2013\"/><ref name=\"ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?\"/><ref name=\"I have ASMR, do you?\"/>\n\n===Auditory===\nMany of those who experience ASMR report that non-vocal [[ambient noise]]s performed through human action are also effective triggers of ASMR. Examples of such noises include fingers scratching or tapping a surface, brushing hair, hands rubbing together or manipulating fabric, the crushing of eggshells, the crinkling and crumpling of a flexible material such as paper, or writing. Many [[YouTube]] videos that are intended to trigger ASMR responses feature a single person performing these actions and the sounds that result.<ref name=\"Why music gives you the chills\"/>\n\n===Personal attention role play===\nIn addition to the effectiveness of specific auditory stimuli, many subjects report that ASMR is triggered by the receipt of tender personal attention, often comprising combined physical touch and vocal expression, such as when having their hair cut, nails painted, [[mimikaki|ears cleaned]], or back massaged, whilst the service provider speaks quietly to the recipient.  \n\nFurthermore, many of those who have experienced ASMR during these and other comparable encounters with a service provider report that watching an \"ASMRtist\" simulate the provision of such personal attention, acting directly to the camera as if the viewer were the recipient of a simulated service, is sufficient to trigger it.<ref name=\"Ahuja2013\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themarysue.com/what-the-hell-is-asmr/ |title=Brain Orgasms, Spidey Sense, and Bob Ross: A Look Inside The World Of ASMR |work=[[Dan Abrams|The Mary Sue]] |first=Carolyn |last=Cox |date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nPsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that personal attention was an effective trigger for 69% of the 475 subjects who participated in a study conducted at [[Swansea University]], second in popularity only to whispering.<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/>\n\n===Clinical role play===\nAmong the category of intentional ASMR videos that simulate the provision of personal attention is a subcategory of those specifically depicting the \"ASMRtist\" providing clinical or medical services, including routine general medical examinations.

Nonetheless, many subjects attribute therapeutic outcomes to these and other categories of intentional ASMR videos, and there are voluminous anecdotal reports of their effectiveness in inducing sleep for those susceptible to [[insomnia]], and assuaging a range of symptoms including those associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[panic attack]]s.<ref name=\"Manduley2013\"/><ref name=\"vice.com\"/><ref name=\"well.blogs.nytimes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/rustle-tingle-relax-the-compelling-world-of-a-s-m-r/ |title=Rustle, Tingle, Relax: The Compelling World of ASMR |work=[[The New York Times]] |format=Blog |first=Stephanie |last=Fairyington |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the first peer-reviewed article on ASMR, published in ''Perspectives in Biology'' in summer 2013, Nitin Ahuja, who was at the time of publication a medical resident at the [[University of Virginia]], invited conjecture on whether the receipt of simulated medical attention might have some tangible therapeutic value for the recipient, comparing the purported positive outcome of clinical role play ASMR videos with the themes of the novel ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' by author and physician [[Walker Percy]], published in 1971.<ref name=\"Ahuja2013\"/>\n\nThe story follows Tom More, a psychiatrist living in a dystopian future who develops a device called the Ontological Lapsometer that, when traced across the scalp of a patient, detects the neurochemical correlation to a range of disturbances. In the course of the novel, More admits that the 'mere application of his device' to a patient's body 'results in the partial relief of his symptoms'.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqNpSRe1NSwC |title=Love in the ruins: The adventures of a bad Catholic at a time near the end of the world |publisher=Open Road Media |first=Walker |last=Percy |date=2011 |isbn=978-1-4532-1620-0}}.</ref>\n\nAhuja alleges that through the character of Tom More, as depicted in ''Love in the Ruins'', Percy 'displays an intuitive understanding of the diagnostic act as a form of therapy unto itself'.

Unintentional media is that made for other reasons, often before attention was drawn to the phenomenon in 2007, but which some subjects discover to be effective in triggering ASMR. One example of unintentional media is of painter [[Bob Ross]]. In episodes of his television series ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' both broadcast and on YouTube, his soft, gentle speaking mannerisms and the sound of him painting and his tools trigger the effect in some viewers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newsweek.com/2014/10/10/soothing-sounds-bob-ross-274466.html |title=The Soothing Sounds of Bob Ross |work=[[Newsweek]] |first=Joe |last=Kloc |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmessitte/2015/03/31/is-there-any-money-to-be-made-in-asmr/ |title=Is There Any Money To Be Made In ASMR? |work=[[Forbes]] |first=Nick |last=Messitte |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>  The work of stop-motion filmmaker [[PES (director)|PES]] is also often noted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/kbn84x/5-stop-motion-meditations-from-pes-reddit-ama |title=5 Stop-Motion Meditations From PES's Reddit AMA |series=Creators |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Zach |last=Sokol |date=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Binaural recording===\n{{main|Binaural recording}}\n[[File:Examen des oreilles - Role Play ear exam - Binaural ASMR FR.webm|thumb|A binaural roleplay ASMR video from YouTube]]\nSome ASMR video creators use [[binaural recording]] techniques to simulate the acoustics of a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional environment]], reported to elicit in viewers and listeners the experience of being in proximity to actor and vocalist.<ref name=\"theverge.com\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/12/8021733/3d-audio-3dio-binaural-immersive-vr-sound-times-square-new-york |title=Surrounded by sound: how 3D audio hacks your brain.

However, in binaural recordings, the two microphones tend to be more specially designed to mimic ears on humans. In many cases, microphones are separated the same distance as ears are on humans, and microphones are surrounded by ear-shaped cups to get similar reverb as human ears.\n\nViewing and hearing such ASMR videos that comprise ambient sound captured through [[binaural recording]] has been compared to the reported effect of listening to [[binaural beats]], which are also alleged to precipitate pleasurable sensations and the subjective experience of calm and equanimity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://kotaku.com/5963533/this-drug-is-legal-its-digital-and-its-supposed-to-improve-how-you-game-i-put-it-to-the-test |title=This drug is legal. it's digital. and it's supposed to improve how you game.

When listening to sound through loudspeakers, the left and right ear can both hear the sound coming from both speakers. By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html |title=Binaural for Beginners (FAQs) |website=Binaural.com |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nListening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterized by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source. Secondly, the listener perceives what is often reported as a three-dimensional sound.<ref name=\"theverge.com\"/> This means the listener can perceive both the position and distance of the source of sound relative to them.\n\n==Scientific research and commentary==\n\n===Peer-reviewed articles===\nSeveral [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles about ASMR have been published. The first, by the physician Nitin Ahuja, is titled \"It Feels Good to Be Measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles\". It was published in ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'' in 2013 and focused on a conjectural cultural and literary analysis.<ref name=\"Ahuja2013\"/>\n\nAnother article, published in the journal ''Television and New Media'' in November 2014, is by Joceline Andersen, a doctoral student in the Department of Art History and Communication Studies at [[McGill University]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people/phd-students/joceline-andersen |title=Joceline Andersen |publisher=McGill University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133621/https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people/phd-students/joceline-andersen |archivedate=5 March 2016 |access-date=29 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> who suggested that ASMR videos comprising whispering 'create an intimate sonic space shared by the listener and the whisperer'. Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Now You've Got the Shiveries |journal=Television & New Media |last=Andersen |first=Joceline |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=683\u2013700 |year=2014 |doi=10.1177/1527476414556184}}</ref>\n\nAnother article, \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state\", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]].

Subjects viewed several ASMR videos with a screen and headphones while inside the MRI scanner. The study found a significant difference in brain activation between time periods when the subject reported tingling (communicated by pressing a button), as compared to time periods when they were watching a video but not reporting tingling (communicated by pressing a different button, to control for brain activation effects caused by merely pressing a button). They concluded that \"the brain regions found most active during the tingling sensations were the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[prefrontal cortex|mPFC]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[secondary somatosensory cortex]]\", and suggested that these were similar to \"activation of brain regions previously observed during experiences like social bonding and musical [[frisson]]\".<ref name=\"BioImpacts 2018-09-23\">{{cite journal |title=An fMRI investigation of the neural correlates underlying the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=Bioimpacts |first1=Bryson C. |last1=Lochte |first2=Sean A. |last2=Guillory |first3=Craig A.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomenon, Novella said \"in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described\" it with \"fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches \u2013 we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\" Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure or another way to activate the \"pleasure response\". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ |title=ASMR |work=Neurologica Blog |publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ |title=ASMR |website=Skepticblog.org |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nFour months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR \"might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel\" and \"doesn't happen for everyone\".

However, in binaural recordings, the two microphones tend to be more specially designed to mimic ears on humans. In many cases, microphones are separated the same distance as ears are on humans, and microphones are surrounded by ear-shaped cups to get similar reverb as human ears.\n\nViewing and hearing such ASMR videos that comprise ambient sound captured through [[binaural recording]] has been compared to the reported effect of listening to [[binaural beats]], which are also alleged to precipitate pleasurable sensations and the subjective experience of calm and equanimity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://kotaku.com/5963533/this-drug-is-legal-its-digital-and-its-supposed-to-improve-how-you-game-i-put-it-to-the-test |title=This drug is legal. it's digital. and it's supposed to improve how you game.

When listening to sound through loudspeakers, the left and right ear can both hear the sound coming from both speakers. By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html |title=Binaural for Beginners (FAQs) |website=Binaural.com |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nListening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterized by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source.

Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Now You've Got the Shiveries |journal=Television & New Media |last=Andersen |first=Joceline |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=683\u2013700 |year=2014 |doi=10.1177/1527476414556184}}</ref>\n\nAnother article, \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state\", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]].

Subjects viewed several ASMR videos with a screen and headphones while inside the MRI scanner. The study found a significant difference in brain activation between time periods when the subject reported tingling (communicated by pressing a button), as compared to time periods when they were watching a video but not reporting tingling (communicated by pressing a different button, to control for brain activation effects caused by merely pressing a button). They concluded that \"the brain regions found most active during the tingling sensations were the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[prefrontal cortex|mPFC]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[secondary somatosensory cortex]]\", and suggested that these were similar to \"activation of brain regions previously observed during experiences like social bonding and musical [[frisson]]\".<ref name=\"BioImpacts 2018-09-23\">{{cite journal |title=An fMRI investigation of the neural correlates underlying the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=Bioimpacts |first1=Bryson C. |last1=Lochte |first2=Sean A. |last2=Guillory |first3=Craig A.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomenon, Novella said \"in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described\" it with \"fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches \u2013 we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\" Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure or another way to activate the \"pleasure response\". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ |title=ASMR |work=Neurologica Blog |publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ |title=ASMR |website=Skepticblog.org |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nFour months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR \"might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel\" and \"doesn't happen for everyone\".

It is named after Saint [[Columba]], the missionary monk from [[County Donegal]] who founded a monastery in the area. The college was originally built to educate young people into the priesthood, but now educates young people in a variety of things.\n\nSt Columb's College was established in 1879 on Bishop Street (now the site of [[Lumen Christi College (Derry, Northern Ireland)|Lumen Christi College]]), but later moved to Buncrana Road in the suburbs of the city.\n\n== Early history ==\nSt Columb's College was preceded by several failed attempts to create such an institution in Derry. Repeated but sporadic efforts were made to maintain a seminary for almost a century; at Clady, near [[Strabane]], in the late eighteenth century, at Ferguson's Lane in Derry in the early nineteenth century and at Pump Street (first reference to St Columb's College as such) in the city from 1841 to 1864.\n\nSt Columb's finally opened its doors on 3 November 1879 with two priest teachers, Dr Edward O'Brien and Dr John Hassan. The school was considered to be quite large at the time and was expected to accommodate 20&ndash;30 boarders. The school quickly gained a reputation for academic achievement. On 18 September 1931 the ''[[Derry Journal]]'' listed St Columb's College's academic results. They were as follows;\nTwo University Scholarships,\nThree Exhibitions and Prizes,\nSix Calls in King's Scholarship Exam (calls to teacher training),\nTwo Pupil Teacherships,\nEight regional Committee Scholarships,\n31 Passed Matriculation,\n26 Passed Senior Leaving Cert. Exam,\n52 Passed Junior Leaving Cert. Exam.\nThe results were impressive for a young and regional school but they were testimony to the scholarship that was taking place at St Columb's.\n\n== The Education Act, 1947 and expansion ==\nOne of the most notable ''alumni'' of St Columb's College, [[John Hume]], noted, \"When the history of St. Columb's College in this century is written, it will be clear that one of its major transformations, if not its major transformation, took place as a result of the Eleven Plus examination.\"\nThe Education Act, 1947, provided for free secondary education to all throughout the United Kingdom. Entry to St. Columb's College, a Grammar school, would be determined by one's performance in the [[11-plus]] or Transfer Test. The immediate result was an explosion in pupil numbers, a shortfall in teaching staff and greater pressure on existing resources. In 1941 the student body numbered 263. By 1960 the number stood at 770 with a teaching staff of 35. In under twenty years the school's size had tripled. It was now clear that additional facilities would be needed.\nIn September 1973 St. Columb's College opened a new campus on the Buncrana Road in the city. The new site would cater for the senior years; its initial enrolment was of 900. The new building was designed by Frank Corr of Corr & McCormick and constructed by J Kennedy & Co. The total cost was \u00a3762,000.{{Citation needed|reason=It would be helpful if there was a reference to back up this claim|date=December 2013}} This figure does not include the \u00a356,000 spent employing W & J McMonagle Ltd to construct the playing fields.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe school has a long and successful sporting history, with its students competing in many events across the country. It has excelled in [[soccer]], [[Gaelic football]], [[basketball]] and has produced many athletes.\n\n==Nobel Prize winners==\nThe school claims two [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureates]] amongst its [[alumni]]. They are:\n*[[Seamus Heaney]] \u2013 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], 1995\n*[[John Hume]] \u2013 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], 1998 (shared with David Trimble)\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{see also|Category:People educated at St Columb's College}}\nThe college's former pupils association makes an annual award (the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award) to \"a past-pupil who has achieved something of major significance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field\".\nNotable winners of the award are as follows:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*1994 [[Edward Daly (bishop)|The Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly]]\n*1995 [[John Hume]], former [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]]\n*1996 [[Seamus Heaney]], poet\n*1997 [[Brian Friel]], playwright\n*1999 [[Monsignor Brendan Devlin]], cleric\n*2002 [[Martin O'Neill]], football player and manager\n*2003 [[Phil Coulter]], composer\n*2004 Honouring all alumni (as part of the school's 125th anniversary celebrations)\n*2005 [[James A.

It is named after Saint [[Columba]], the missionary monk from [[County Donegal]] who founded a monastery in the area. The college was originally built to educate young people into the priesthood, but now educates young people in a variety of things.\n\nSt Columb's College was established in 1879 on Bishop Street (now the site of [[Lumen Christi College (Derry, Northern Ireland)|Lumen Christi College]]), but later moved to Buncrana Road in the suburbs of the city.\n\n== Early history ==\nSt Columb's College was preceded by several failed attempts to create such an institution in Derry. Repeated but sporadic efforts were made to maintain a seminary for almost a century; at Clady, near [[Strabane]], in the late eighteenth century, at Ferguson's Lane in Derry in the early nineteenth century and at Pump Street (first reference to St Columb's College as such) in the city from 1841 to 1864.\n\nSt Columb's finally opened its doors on 3 November 1879 with two priest teachers, Dr Edward O'Brien and Dr John Hassan. The school was considered to be quite large at the time and was expected to accommodate 20&ndash;30 boarders. The school quickly gained a reputation for academic achievement. On 18 September 1931 the ''[[Derry Journal]]'' listed St Columb's College's academic results. They were as follows;\nTwo University Scholarships,\nThree Exhibitions and Prizes,\nSix Calls in King's Scholarship Exam (calls to teacher training),\nTwo Pupil Teacherships,\nEight regional Committee Scholarships,\n31 Passed Matriculation,\n26 Passed Senior Leaving Cert. Exam,\n52 Passed Junior Leaving Cert. Exam.\nThe results were impressive for a young and regional school but they were testimony to the scholarship that was taking place at St Columb's.\n\n== The Education Act, 1947 and expansion ==\nOne of the most notable ''alumni'' of St Columb's College, [[John Hume]], noted, \"When the history of St. Columb's College in this century is written, it will be clear that one of its major transformations, if not its major transformation, took place as a result of the Eleven Plus examination.\"\nThe Education Act, 1947, provided for free secondary education to all throughout the United Kingdom. Entry to St. Columb's College, a Grammar school, would be determined by one's performance in the [[11-plus]] or Transfer Test. The immediate result was an explosion in pupil numbers, a shortfall in teaching staff and greater pressure on existing resources. In 1941 the student body numbered 263. By 1960 the number stood at 770 with a teaching staff of 35. In under twenty years the school's size had tripled. It was now clear that additional facilities would be needed.\nIn September 1973 St. Columb's College opened a new campus on the Buncrana Road in the city. The new site would cater for the senior years; its initial enrolment was of 900. The new building was designed by Frank Corr of Corr & McCormick and constructed by J Kennedy & Co. The total cost was \u00a3762,000.{{Citation needed|reason=It would be helpful if there was a reference to back up this claim|date=December 2013}} This figure does not include the \u00a356,000 spent employing W & J McMonagle Ltd to construct the playing fields.\n\n== Sport ==\nThe school has a long and successful sporting history, with its students competing in many events across the country. It has excelled in [[soccer]], [[Gaelic football]], [[basketball]] and has produced many athletes.\n\n==Nobel Prize winners==\nThe school claims two [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureates]] amongst its [[alumni]]. They are:\n*[[Seamus Heaney]] \u2013 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], 1995\n*[[John Hume]] \u2013 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], 1998 (shared with David Trimble)\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{see also|Category:People educated at St Columb's College}}\nThe college's former pupils association makes an annual award (the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award) to \"a past-pupil who has achieved something of major significance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field\".\nNotable winners of the award are as follows:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*1994 [[Edward Daly (bishop)|The Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly]]\n*1995 [[John Hume]], former [[Member of Parliament|MP]], [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]]\n*1996 [[Seamus Heaney]], poet\n*1997 [[Brian Friel]], playwright\n*1999 [[Monsignor Brendan Devlin]], cleric\n*2002 [[Martin O'Neill]], football player and manager\n*2003 [[Phil Coulter]], composer\n*2004 Honouring all alumni (as part of the school's 125th anniversary celebrations)\n*2005 [[James A.
