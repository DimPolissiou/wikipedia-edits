In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Alfred B.

The entry for the Dutch parliament competition was the first of a series of controversial and successful international competition entries by OMA in the 1980s that were not built by OMA.\n\n===OMA in the 1980s===\nOMA's first major commissions were The Netherlands Dance Theatre (1981) in The Hague and IJ-Plein Urban planning (1981\u20131988) in [[Amsterdam]]. Due to change of location a second design for the Dance Theater was made in 1984. Once completed in 1987, the building received international attention.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although full of \"first mistakes\", the Dance Theater is the first realized design in which the ideas of Rem Koolhaas were made apparent. IJ-plein is located at Amsterdam's [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]], a river that serves as the city's waterfront, opposite the city center. The master plan consists of 1,300 dwellings and several facilities. OMA designed the school, the community center, and two blocks of housing.\n\nA few other designs were realized in the 1980s: a police station in [[Almere]] (1982\u20131985), a bus station in [[Rotterdam]] (1985\u20131987, demolished in 2005), Byzantium apartment block in Amsterdam (1985\u20131991) and [[Checkpoint Charlie]] Housing in [[Berlin]] (1984\u20131990). Two houses were built in this period; the first house was a duo of patio villas (1985\u20131988) in the style of [[Mies van der Rohe]], inserted in a [[Dike (construction)|dike]] in Rotterdam. The second \u2013 arguably the most full-grown design of OMA until that date \u2013 was Villa Dall'Ava in Paris (1984\u20131991). The client, according to Koolhaas, asked for a \"masterpiece\".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} He wanted a glass house. She wanted a swimming pool on the roof. So many delays plagued the house that it \"became a record of our own (OMA's) growing up\".<ref name=SMLXL/>\n\nSeveral studies were made during the late 1970s and 1980s: Study for the renovation of a [[panopticon]] prison in [[Arnhem]] in 1979, ''Boompjes'' tower slab in Rotterdam (1979), Housing for [[International Building Exhibition Berlin|Berlin IBA]] (1980, not realised, and the reason OMA would not design anything in Berlin anymore in the 20th century, the Dutch Embassy Building being the comeback),{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} master plan for a world exhibition in Paris (1983). Much more important however were the competition entries OMA designed in this period. They gained the office international fame (but not one design was actually built).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===OMA in the 1990s===\nIn the 1990s OMA gained renown through a series of groundbreaking entries{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} in major competitions: e.g.,&nbsp;Tres Grande Biblioth\u00e8que and Two Libraries for [[Jussieu University]], Paris, France (1993). During these years OMA also realized ambitious projects, ranging from private residences to large scale urban plans: Villa dall\u2019Ava, Paris, France (1991), Nexus Housing, Fukuoka, Japan (1991), the [[Kunsthal]], Rotterdam (1992).\n\nThe [[Euralille]] (1994), a 70-hectare business and civic center in [[Lille]], northern France comprising the European hub for [[High-speed rail|high-speed trains]], transformed a once dormant center of more than 50&nbsp;million inhabitants into a site offering connectivity, and a range of contemporary activities.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn 1999 OMA completed the Maison \u00e0 Bordeaux, a villa for a client in the hills outside [[Bordeaux]], France.<ref name=Time1998/> The villa's most striking feature is a platform in the very center of the house that moves freely between the three floors and allowed the client to move with his wheelchair on all three levels of the villa.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The design was conceived in collaboration with engineer [[Cecil Balmond]].\n\n===OMA in the 21st century===\nOMA's recently completed projects include the Viktor & Rolf Store in London (2011), [[Edouard Malingue Gallery]] in Hong Kong (2010),<ref name=ArchDaily2010/> Prada Transformer, a rotating multi-use pavilion in Seoul (2009),<ref name=Prada/> the Zeche Zollverein Historical Museum and master plan in Essen (2006), the Seoul National University Museum of Art (2005), the much acclaimed [[Casa da M\u00fasica]] in Porto (2005),<ref name=ArchJ-UK/> the Prada Epicenter in Los Angeles (2004), the [[Seattle Central Library]] (2004),<ref name=Barry2013/> the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art (2004), the Netherlands Embassy in Berlin (2003)<ref name=VanGelder2005/> and the [[McCormick Tribune Campus Center]] at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in Chicago (2003).\n\nOMA was awarded the contract for the [[Seattle Central Library]], completed in 2005, despite not having been on the list of firms originally invited to submit designs. Former Seattle resident [[Joshua Prince-Ramus]], a partner, heard from his mother about the meeting for interested firms at the last minute and flew in from the Netherlands. This 11-story glass and steel building is a striking addition to the [[Seattle]] cityscape.\n\nIn Asia OMA recently completed the massive [[CCTV Headquarters|Central China Television Headquarters]] building in Beijing, and the new building for the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] is currently under construction. In January 2009 OMA won the competition to build a performing arts centre in [[Taipei]] and in June 2009 the office won the competition to design \"Crystal Island\", a transport and cultural hub in the centre of Shenzhen.\n\nIn October 2011, the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican Art Gallery]] launched their exhibition \"OMA/Progress\", the first major presentation of OMA's work in the UK, curated by Belgium-based creative collective Rotor.\n\nOMA (and Rem Koolhaas) are well known for controversial projects such as the proposal to adapt part of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] into a promotional space titled MoMa Inc.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Leadership===\nOMA's leadership is organized as a collaborative partnership. OMA's current partners are [[Rem Koolhaas]], Ellen van Loon, [[Reinier de Graaf (architect)|Reinier de Graaf]], Shohei Shigematsu, Iyad Alsaka, David Gianotten, Chris van Duijn, Ippolito Pestellini Laparelli and Jason Long.\n\n===Offices===\nOMA maintains offices in Rotterdam, New York, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Doha.\n\n* '''OMA Rotterdam''' \u2014 Projects include{{when|date=November 2013}} construction of the new headquarters for Rothschild Bank in London and [[De Rotterdam]], the largest building in the Netherlands; design development of Stadskantoor, a new city hall building in Rotterdam; the ''Biblioth\u00e8que Municipales \u00e0 Vocation R\u00e9gionale'' in Caen; Maggie's Centre for cancer care in Glasgow; and the Cordoba Congress Center in Spain (later put on hold).

With a distinct faceted form, ''[[New York Times]]'' critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called it \"a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty\".<ref name=NYT2005/> Inside, the elevated 1,300-seat Grand Auditorium, in the shape of a shoebox, has corrugated glass fa\u00e7ades at either end that open the hall to the city and offer Porto itself as a dramatic backdrop for performances. As well as the Grand Auditorium, conceived as a simple mass hollowed out end-to-end from the solid form of the building, the Casa da M\u00fasica also contains a smaller, more flexible performance space with no fixed seating.\n\n===Netherlands Embassy, Berlin===\n{{main article|Embassy of the Netherlands, Berlin}}\nWinner of the 2005 [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|Mies van der Rohe Award]] (the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture), OMA's Netherlands Embassy in Berlin is an isolated cube surrounded on two sides by a perimeter wall. The cube is punctured by a cantilevered meeting room and the visibility of the zig-zagging, interior path through the building.\n\n===Waterfront City, Dubai===\n{{main article|Waterfront City, Dubai}}\nIn 2007 OMA was commissioned by [[Nakheel Properties]] to design a master plan for Waterfront City located on an artificial island off the Persian Gulf in Dubai.<ref name=ArchRec2008/><ref name=NYTDubai/> The design for Waterfront City will accommodate as many as 1.5&nbsp;million people and cover an area of {{convert|34435|acre|km2}}.

The Barcode unites the flags of the EU countries into a single, colorful symbol.\n\nIn the current [[European flag]], there is a fixed number of stars. In the Barcode, however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the Barcode displayed 15 EU countries, and in 2004 the symbol was adapted to include ten new Member States.\n\nSince the time of the first drafts of the Barcode, it had never been officially used by commercial or political institutions, until it was officially used for the first time during the 2006 Austrian [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].<ref name=Toth2005/> The logo has already been used for the EU information campaign which will also be continued during the Austrian EU Presidency.

Their first major project was the [[utopia]]n/[[dystopia]]n project ''Exodus, or the Voluntary Prisoners of Architecture'' (1972). This project proposed a linear structure, cutting through London like a knife. Other projects included City of the Captive Globe (1974), Hotel Sphinx (1975), New Welfare Island/Welfare Palace Hotel (1975\u201376), [[Roosevelt Island]] Redevelopment (1975) \u2013 all \"paper\" projects that were not (intended to be) built, and all located in [[Manhattan]], the subject of Koolhaas's book ''Delirious New York, A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan'' (1975).<ref name=OMA/>\n\nThe founding of OMA coincided with the firm's entry in the [[architectural design competition]] for a new Dutch parliament building in [[The Hague]] in 1978, with [[Zaha Hadid]]. OMA was one of the first-prize winners (among some 10 others), and the project was widely discussed and published.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The commission, however, was given to an architect who did not participate in the competition. The entry for the Dutch parliament competition was the first of a series of controversial and successful international competition entries by OMA in the 1980s that were not built by OMA.\n\n===OMA in the 1980s===\nOMA's first major commissions were The Netherlands Dance Theatre (1981) in The Hague and IJ-Plein Urban planning (1981\u20131988) in [[Amsterdam]]. Due to change of location a second design for the Dance Theater was made in 1984. Once completed in 1987, the building received international attention.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although full of \"first mistakes\", the Dance Theater is the first realized design in which the ideas of Rem Koolhaas were made apparent. IJ-plein is located at Amsterdam's [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]], a river that serves as the city's waterfront, opposite the city center. The master plan consists of 1,300 dwellings and several facilities. OMA designed the school, the community center, and two blocks of housing.\n\nA few other designs were realized in the 1980s: a police station in [[Almere]] (1982\u20131985), a bus station in [[Rotterdam]] (1985\u20131987, demolished in 2005), Byzantium apartment block in Amsterdam (1985\u20131991) and [[Checkpoint Charlie]] Housing in [[Berlin]] (1984\u20131990). Two houses were built in this period; the first house was a duo of patio villas (1985\u20131988) in the style of [[Mies van der Rohe]], inserted in a [[Dike (construction)|dike]] in Rotterdam. The second \u2013 arguably the most full-grown design of OMA until that date \u2013 was Villa Dall'Ava in Paris (1984\u20131991). The client, according to Koolhaas, asked for a \"masterpiece\".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} He wanted a glass house. She wanted a swimming pool on the roof. So many delays plagued the house that it \"became a record of our own (OMA's) growing up\".<ref name=SMLXL/>\n\nSeveral studies were made during the late 1970s and 1980s: Study for the renovation of a [[panopticon]] prison in [[Arnhem]] in 1979, ''Boompjes'' tower slab in Rotterdam (1979), Housing for [[International Building Exhibition Berlin|Berlin IBA]] (1980, not realised, and the reason OMA would not design anything in Berlin anymore in the 20th century, the Dutch Embassy Building being the comeback),{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} master plan for a world exhibition in Paris (1983). Much more important however were the competition entries OMA designed in this period. They gained the office international fame (but not one design was actually built).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===OMA in the 1990s===\nIn the 1990s OMA gained renown through a series of groundbreaking entries{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} in major competitions: e.g.,&nbsp;Tres Grande Biblioth\u00e8que and Two Libraries for [[Jussieu University]], Paris, France (1993). During these years OMA also realized ambitious projects, ranging from private residences to large scale urban plans: Villa dall\u2019Ava, Paris, France (1991), Nexus Housing, Fukuoka, Japan (1991), the [[Kunsthal]], Rotterdam (1992).\n\nThe [[Euralille]] (1994), a 70-hectare business and civic center in [[Lille]], northern France comprising the European hub for [[High-speed rail|high-speed trains]], transformed a once dormant center of more than 50&nbsp;million inhabitants into a site offering connectivity, and a range of contemporary activities.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn 1999 OMA completed the Maison \u00e0 Bordeaux, a villa for a client in the hills outside [[Bordeaux]], France.<ref name=Time1998/> The villa's most striking feature is a platform in the very center of the house that moves freely between the three floors and allowed the client to move with his wheelchair on all three levels of the villa.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The design was conceived in collaboration with engineer [[Cecil Balmond]].\n\n===OMA in the 21st century===\nOMA's recently completed projects include the Viktor & Rolf Store in London (2011), [[Edouard Malingue Gallery]] in Hong Kong (2010),<ref name=ArchDaily2010/> Prada Transformer, a rotating multi-use pavilion in Seoul (2009),<ref name=Prada/> the Zeche Zollverein Historical Museum and master plan in Essen (2006), the Seoul National University Museum of Art (2005), the much acclaimed [[Casa da M\u00fasica]] in Porto (2005),<ref name=ArchJ-UK/> the Prada Epicenter in Los Angeles (2004), the [[Seattle Central Library]] (2004),<ref name=Barry2013/> the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art (2004), the Netherlands Embassy in Berlin (2003)<ref name=VanGelder2005/> and the [[McCormick Tribune Campus Center]] at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in Chicago (2003).\n\nOMA was awarded the contract for the [[Seattle Central Library]], completed in 2005, despite not having been on the list of firms originally invited to submit designs. Former Seattle resident [[Joshua Prince-Ramus]], a partner, heard from his mother about the meeting for interested firms at the last minute and flew in from the Netherlands. This 11-story glass and steel building is a striking addition to the [[Seattle]] cityscape.\n\nIn Asia OMA recently completed the massive [[CCTV Headquarters|Central China Television Headquarters]] building in Beijing, and the new building for the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] is currently under construction. In January 2009 OMA won the competition to build a performing arts centre in [[Taipei]] and in June 2009 the office won the competition to design \"Crystal Island\", a transport and cultural hub in the centre of Shenzhen.\n\nIn October 2011, the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican Art Gallery]] launched their exhibition \"OMA/Progress\", the first major presentation of OMA's work in the UK, curated by Belgium-based creative collective Rotor.\n\nOMA (and Rem Koolhaas) are well known for controversial projects such as the proposal to adapt part of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] into a promotional space titled MoMa Inc.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Leadership===\nOMA's leadership is organized as a collaborative partnership. OMA's current partners are [[Rem Koolhaas]], Ellen van Loon, [[Reinier de Graaf (architect)|Reinier de Graaf]], Shohei Shigematsu, Iyad Alsaka, David Gianotten, Chris van Duijn, Ippolito Pestellini Laparelli and Jason Long.\n\n===Offices===\nOMA maintains offices in Rotterdam, New York, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Doha.\n\n* '''OMA Rotterdam''' \u2014 Projects include{{when|date=November 2013}} construction of the new headquarters for Rothschild Bank in London and [[De Rotterdam]], the largest building in the Netherlands; design development of Stadskantoor, a new city hall building in Rotterdam; the ''Biblioth\u00e8que Municipales \u00e0 Vocation R\u00e9gionale'' in Caen; Maggie's Centre for cancer care in Glasgow; and the Cordoba Congress Center in Spain (later put on hold). The office is also working on several projects in the Middle East including three buildings for [[Education City]] in Qatar.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n* '''OMA New York''' \u2014 Projects include a 550-foot residential tower in San Francisco, and now under construction is a new building for the [[Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec]]. In 2011, the office completed Milstein Hall, a new building for the College of Architecture, Art and Planning at [[Cornell University]].<ref name=SFGate2014/><ref name=ArchDaily2011/>\n\n* '''OMA Beijing''' \u2014 Projects include{{when|date=November 2013}} the office's largest project to date, the 575,000 m<sup>2</sup> [[China Central Television]] Headquarters (CCTV) and Television Cultural Center (TVCC), in Beijing. Other projects in development include a residential tower and residential master plan in Singapore.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n* '''OMA Hong Kong''' \u2014 Projects include{{when|date=November 2013}} the new [[Chu Hai College of Higher Education|Chu Hai College]] campus in Hong Kong, construction of the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]], and design development of the Taipei Performing Arts Centre.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===AMO===\nIn 1998 Koolhaas founded AMO, a think tank within OMA dedicated to producing non-architectural work including exhibitions, branding campaigns, publishing, and [[energy planning]].<ref name=MensVogue2007/> AMO has produced exhibitions at the [[Venice Biennale]] (on the Hermitage museum in [[St.&nbsp;Petersburg]]) and Venice Architecture Biennale (on the development of the Gulf, and, in 2010, on preservation),<ref name=Bienniale/> and guest-edited issues of the magazines ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and ''[[Domus (magazine)|Domus]]''. AMO has produced work for [[Universal Studios]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], [[Harvard University]], [[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications|Cond\u00e9 Nast]], [[Heineken]], and [[IKEA]].\n\nAMO projects also include the development of in-store technology for [[Prada]], a strategy for the future of [[Volkswagen]], a strategy for TMRW, new organic fast food chain, work for Platform&nbsp;21, new design institute in Amsterdam, a curatorial master plan for the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St.&nbsp;Petersburg]], and ''Roadmap 2050: A Practical Guide to a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Europe''.<ref name=Roadmap2050/> In 2008 AMO curated the exhibition \"Dubai Next\" at the [[Vitra Design Museum]] in [[Weil am Rhein]], and was one of the editors on the book ''Al Manakh'', which details the rapid transformation of the Gulf region. In 2010 in collaboration with Archis and Think Tank, AMO made the follow-up, ''Al Manakh&nbsp;2''.\n\n==Notable works==\n\n===Seattle Central Library===\n{{main article|Seattle Central Library}}\nIn 1999 OMA won a competition to design a new central library for the [[Seattle|city of Seattle]].<ref name=SeattlePLib/> The [[Seattle Central Library]] was completed and opened to the public on May 23, 2004.<ref name=SeattlePLib/> In 2005, the library earned a national [[American Institute of Architects]] Honor Award for Architecture.<ref name=AIA2007/> The building has also been described as \"the most important new library to be built in a generation, and the most exhilarating\" by ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]].<ref name=Goldberger2004/>\n\n===Casa da M\u00fasica, Porto===\n{{main article|Casa da M\u00fasica}}\nCompleted in 2005, the new home of the National Orchestra of Porto, the [[Casa da M\u00fasica]], stands on a new public square in the historic Rotunda da Boavista. With a distinct faceted form, ''[[New York Times]]'' critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called it \"a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty\".<ref name=NYT2005/> Inside, the elevated 1,300-seat Grand Auditorium, in the shape of a shoebox, has corrugated glass fa\u00e7ades at either end that open the hall to the city and offer Porto itself as a dramatic backdrop for performances. As well as the Grand Auditorium, conceived as a simple mass hollowed out end-to-end from the solid form of the building, the Casa da M\u00fasica also contains a smaller, more flexible performance space with no fixed seating.\n\n===Netherlands Embassy, Berlin===\n{{main article|Embassy of the Netherlands, Berlin}}\nWinner of the 2005 [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|Mies van der Rohe Award]] (the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture), OMA's Netherlands Embassy in Berlin is an isolated cube surrounded on two sides by a perimeter wall. The cube is punctured by a cantilevered meeting room and the visibility of the zig-zagging, interior path through the building.\n\n===Waterfront City, Dubai===\n{{main article|Waterfront City, Dubai}}\nIn 2007 OMA was commissioned by [[Nakheel Properties]] to design a master plan for Waterfront City located on an artificial island off the Persian Gulf in Dubai.<ref name=ArchRec2008/><ref name=NYTDubai/> The design for Waterfront City will accommodate as many as 1.5&nbsp;million people and cover an area of {{convert|34435|acre|km2}}. OMA's urban plan for the city includes designs for five large buildings, including one {{convert|590|ft|m|adj=on}} spherical building that will be designed by OMA and contain a convention center, residences, hotel rooms, and retail stores.<ref name=ArchRec2008/>\n\n===European flag proposal===\n[[File:Union-europea segun rem-koolhaas.svg|thumb|250px|''The Image of Europe'', AMO's proposal for the European flag]]\nFollowing the signing of [[Treaty of Nice|Treaties of Nice]] in May 2001, the then-President of the [[European Commission]], [[Romano Prodi]], and Belgian Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], Koolhaas suggested a European flag, called the \"Barcode\". The Barcode unites the flags of the EU countries into a single, colorful symbol.\n\nIn the current [[European flag]], there is a fixed number of stars.

The significance of findings, their meaning, and what conclusions may be drawn from them is a matter of intense debate. The precise role of consciousness in decision making and how that role may differ across types of decisions remains unclear.\n\nThinkers like [[Daniel Dennett]] or [[Alfred Mele]] consider the language used by researchers. They explain that \"free will\" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will believe we need the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] values of both hard determinists and compatiblists<ref>Smilansky, S. (2002). Free will, fundamental dualism, and the centrality of illusion. In The Oxford handbook of free will.</ref>, some not). Dennett insists that many important and common conceptions of \"free will\" are compatible with the emerging evidence from neuroscience.<ref name=WalterH/><ref name=Kane/><ref name=NatureAim/><ref name=Dennett/>\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1\n|quote = ...the current work is in broad agreement with a general trend in neuroscience of volition: although we may experience that our conscious decisions and thoughts cause our actions, these experiences are in fact based on readouts of brain activity in a network of brain areas that control voluntary action... It is clearly wrong to think of [feeling of willing something] as a prior intention, located at the very earliest moment of decision in an extended action chain. Rather, W seems to mark an intention-in-action, quite closely linked to action execution.\n|source = Patrick Haggard discussing<ref name=HaggardDT/> an in-depth experiment by Itzhak Fried<ref name=Fried/>}}\nThe neuroscience of free will encompasses two main fields of study: volition and agency. Volition, the study of voluntary actions, is difficult to define. If we consider human actions as lying along a spectrum of our involvement in initiating the actions, then reflexes would be on one end, and fully voluntary actions would be on the other.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Haggard |first=Patrick |date=2019-01-04 |title=The Neurocognitive Bases of Human Volition |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201328 |doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103348 |pmid=30125134 |issn=0066-4308}}</ref> How these actions are initiated and consciousness\u2019 role in producing them is a major area of study in volition. Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment that has been debated since the beginning of philosophy. Within the neuroscience of free will the sense of agency\u2014the subjective awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's volitional actions\u2014is usually what is studied.\n\nOne significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second or more (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether 12 subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice.<ref name=\"soonetal\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2112 |title=Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain |year=2008 |last1=Soon |first1=Chun Siong |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Heinze |first3=Hans-Jochen |last4=Haynes |first4=John-Dylan |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=543\u20135 |pmid=18408715|citeseerx=10.1.1.520.2204 }}</ref> These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some definitions of \"free will\".\n\nTo be clear, it is very unlikely that a single study could disprove all definitions of free will. Definitions of free will can vary wildly, and each must be considered separately in light of existing [[empirical evidence]]. There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will.<ref name=\"Klemm\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0076-2 |title=Free will debates: Simple experiments are not so simple |year=2010 |last1=Klemm |first1=W.

There is no agreed-upon measure of brain activity corresponding to conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions, making studying processes related to consciousness difficult. The conclusions drawn from measurements that ''have'' been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings represents. Such a dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision because many other mental processes are going on while performing the task.<ref name=\"Klemm\" /> Although early studies mainly used [[electroencephalography]], more recent studies have used [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]],<ref name=\"soonetal\" /> [[Single-unit recording|single-neuron recordings]],<ref name=\"Fried\" /> and other measures.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Di Russo |first=F. |last2=Berchicci |first2=M. |last3=Bozzacchi |first3=C. |last4=Perri |first4=R.\u00a0L. |last5=Pitzalis |first5=S. |last6=Spinelli |first6=D. |date=2017 |title=Beyond the \"Bereitschaftspotential\": Action preparation behind cognitive functions |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |language=en |volume=78 |pages=57\u201381 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.04.019|pmid=28445742 }}</ref> Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest that consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected&nbsp;\u2013 challenging any versions of \"free will\" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.<ref name=\"NatureAim\" />\n\n===Free will as illusion===\n[[File:Playing the piano.jpg|thumb|left|An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously.]]\nIt is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.\n\nIt may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious \"intentions\" have led us astray; it may be the case that we have [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]] by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in [[neurostimulation]], [[brain damage]], but also research into [[introspection illusion]]s. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for [[moral responsibility]] or lack thereof<ref>Heisenberg, M. (2009). Is free will an illusion?. Nature, 459(7244), 164-165</ref>. Neuroscientist and author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is \"intuitive\": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues: \"Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion\".<ref>\"The Moral Landscape\", p.\u00a0112.</ref> Neuroscientist [[Walter Jackson Freeman III]], nevertheless, talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes: \"our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do.\"<ref>Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p.\u00a0139.</ref> To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.\n\nAn important distinction to make is the difference between proximal and distal intentions.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mele |first=Alfred |title=Free Will: Action Theory Meets Neuroscience |date=2007 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MELFWA-8 |work=Intentionality, Deliberation, and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy |editor-last=Lumer |editor-first=C. |publisher=Ashgate |access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref> Proximal intentions are immediate in the sense that they are about acting ''now''. For instance, a decision to raise a hand now or press a button now, as in Libet-style experiments. Distal intentions are delayed in the sense that they are about acting at a later point in time. For instance, deciding to go to the store later. Research has mostly focused on proximal intentions; however, it is unclear to what degree findings will generalize from one sort of intention to the other.\n\n===Relevance of scientific research===\nSome thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think that these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that \"We feel we choose, but we don't\".<ref name=NatureAim/> Researcher [[John-Dylan Haynes]] adds: \"How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?\".<ref name=NatureAim/> Philosophers Walter Glannon and [[Alfred Mele]] think that some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because \"[[free will]]\" can mean many things: it is unclear what someone means when they say \"free will does not exist\". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] notions of free will&nbsp;\u2013 but that is an \"easy target for neuroscientists to knock down\".<ref name=NatureAim/> Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in [[materialistic]] terms. In these cases, \"free will\" means something more like \"not coerced\" or that \"the person could have done otherwise at the last moment\". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making.<ref name=NatureAim/>\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=40%| quoted=1\n|quote= [Some senses of free will] are compatible with what we are learning from science...

They asked their subjects to read one of two passages: one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control; the other neutral about what influences behaviour. The participants then did a few math problems on a computer. But just before the test started, they were informed that because of a glitch in the computer it occasionally displayed the answer by accident; if this happened, they were to click it away without looking.

[[Benjamin Libet]] investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the \"felt intention\" (or will) to move of experimental subjects.]]\n\nIn a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide ''which hand to move''. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the \"[[lateralized readiness potential]]\" (LRP), an [[event-related potential]] (ERP) component that measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.<ref name=\"HandE\" />\n\nA more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the \"awareness of the intention to move\" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's \"W\"). If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information. However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02254.x |title=We Infer Rather Than Perceive the Moment We Decided to Act |year=2009 |last1=Banks |first1=William P. |last2=Isham |first2=Eve A. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |pages=17\u201321 |pmid=19152537 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention.<ref name=Miller/> In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not.

This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a \"stimulus-response\" circuit and a \"voluntary\" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions.<ref name=\"Haggard, P. 2008\" />\n\nLibet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious \"will\" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their \"will\". Authors have found that [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA]] activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100&nbsp;ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement.<ref name=\"Lau2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Lau |first1=H.

Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the [[readiness potential]]). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.\n\n=====The experiment=====\n[[File:Wijsvinger.jpg|thumb|right|It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain.]]\nMatsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled \"stop-signal\" sound was played at pseudo-random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there ''was'' an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his \"movement genesis\" (or else they would have stopped or \"vetoed\" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.\n\nIn this work, \"movement genesis\" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see [[Benjamin Libet]]).\n\nBy looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness, as seen in the graph below, is called \"T\" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their [[event-related potential]] (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.\n\nThe researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred ''too late'' to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at \u22122.8&nbsp;seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time \"T\" (\u22121.8&nbsp;seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.<ref name=\"Matsuhashi, M. 2008\"/>\n\n=====Analysis and interpretation=====\n[[File:200mW_at_Josef_Odlozil_Memorial_in_Prague_14June2010_064.jpg|thumb|left|A simple \"signalling noise\" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of.]]\nThis study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed \"stop tones\" during the self-paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call \"T\" (time).\n\nTesting the hypothesis that \"conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun\" required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action&nbsp;\u2013 they have passed the action's \"point of no return\". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).\n\n[[File:TimingConsciousIntentiontoMoveHistogram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe that the subject becomes aware of his actions at about 1.8&nbsp;seconds (this is time \"T\"). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as \u22122.8&nbsp;seconds.]]\nThe graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (called \"tone events\" on the graph) on average up until 1.8&nbsp;seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about \u22121.8&nbsp;seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1&nbsp;seconds, meaning that this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (\u22121.8&nbsp;seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to [[Event-related potential|ERP]] measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about \u22122.8&nbsp;seconds on average for this participant. Since T, like Libet's original W, was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.<ref name=\"Matsuhashi, M. 2008\"/>\n\n====Criticisms====\nHaggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing \"a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations\"<ref name=HaggardDT/> such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of [[planning]] has implications for free will, and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our \"conscious self\" has become aware of it does not mean that our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.<ref name=mele>{{cite book\n |author=Alfred R.

Mele\n }}</ref>\n\n===Unconsciously cancelling actions===\nThe possibility that human \"free won't\" is also the prerogative of the subconscious is being explored.\n\n====Retrospective judgement of free choice====\n[[File:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|left|200px|{{clarify span|As green light switches to yellow, research seems to suggest|date=June 2019}} that humans cannot tell the difference between \"deciding\" to keep driving and having no time to decide at all.]]\n\nRecent research by Simone K\u00fchn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may not be what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it ''easy'' to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the [[introspection illusion]]. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to \"veto\" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\n=====The experiment=====\nThe experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic \"go\" button as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/> In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the \"primary response trials\".\n\nThe primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal&nbsp;\u2013 either a \"stop\" or \"decide\" signal. The additional signals occurred after a \"signal delay\" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2&nbsp;seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal, and therefore considered the \"default\" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the \"go\" button) remained.\n\nUpon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the \"go\" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the \"go\" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the \"go\" button or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal (\"decide trials\"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too ''late'' in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).\n\nThose trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600&nbsp;ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600&nbsp;ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400&nbsp;ms.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\nThe participant was asked at the end of those \"decide trials\" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus) or based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data, however, it appears that there was discrepancy between when the user thought that they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses)&nbsp;\u2013 in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought that they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal)&nbsp;\u2013 where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.\n\n=====The rationale=====\n\nKuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed-to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants\u2019 successful decide trials into \"decide go\" and \"decide no-go\", but were not concerned with the no-go trials, since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either.\n[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionTrials.png|thumb|right|400px|The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes]]\n\nKuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the \"failed-to-decide\" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively \u2013 they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the \"successful ''decide''\" trials (where the decision was a \"go\" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important, since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject ''does'' act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\n=====Results and implications=====\n[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionGraph.png|thumb|left|300px|The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled \"successful decide\".]]\nUnsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and \"failed-to-decide\" trials all showed similar RTs: 600&nbsp;ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some \"successful decide\" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400&nbsp;ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as \"successful decide\". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious \"I will not veto\", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain:<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n{{cquote|[The results of the experiment] clearly argue against Libet's assumption that a veto process can be consciously initiated. He used the veto in order to reintroduce the possibility to control the unconsciously initiated actions. But since the subjects are not very accurate in observing when they have [acted impulsively instead of deliberately], the act of vetoing cannot be consciously initiated.}}\n\nIn decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide&nbsp;\u2013 at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but is simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/> Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of \"consciousness\" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously).\n\n=====Criticisms=====\nAfter the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between \"producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming\", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/> To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600&nbsp;ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study).\n\nThe results of the trial in which the so-called \"successful decide\" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response, and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\nIt is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously.<ref name=\"Libet 2003\"/> That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by K\u00fchn and Brass using their decide signal.\n\nDaniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur:<ref>\"Freedom Evolves\" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231.</ref><ref>Dennett, D. [http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact''].</ref>\n<blockquote>\nSuppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds&nbsp;\u2014 a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:\n* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick\n* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations\nso that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.\n</blockquote>\n\n=== The point of no return ===\nIn early 2016, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] published an article by researchers in [[Berlin]], Germany, ''The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements'', in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP).<ref>{{Cite journal |title = The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date = 2016-01-26 |issn = 0027-8424 |pmc = 4743787 |pmid = 26668390 |pages = 1080\u20131085 |volume = 113 |issue = 4 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1513569112 |first = Matthias |last = Schultze-Kraft |first2 = Daniel |last2 = Birman |first3 = Marco |last3 = Rusconi |first4 = Carsten |last4 = Allefeld |first5 = Kai |last5 = G\u00f6rgen |first6 = Sven |last6 = D\u00e4hne |first7 = Benjamin |last7 = Blankertz |first8 = John-Dylan |last8 = Haynes}}</ref> The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> is an instance of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neural oscillation|electrical activity]] within the [[motor cortex]], quantified by the use of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is \"getting ready\" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain that this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans:<ref>{{Cite web |title = Neuroscience and Free Will Are Rethinking Their Divorce |url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html |website = Science of Us |access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref> previously, it had been argued<ref>{{Cite web |title = Brain might not stand in the way of free will |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22144-brain-might-not-stand-in-the-way-of-free-will/ |website = New Scientist |access-date = 2016-02-13 |first = Anil |last = Ananthaswamy}}</ref> that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21870/free_will_web.pdf |title = Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism |date = |access-date = |website = Oxford University |publisher = Oxford University Press |last = Swinburne |first = R.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title = Libet Experiments |url = http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html |website = www.informationphilosopher.com |access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref> The study showed that subjects were able to \"override\" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a \"point of no return\": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it at least 200&nbsp;[[millisecond]]s before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] and [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be increased or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.<ref>[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

Studies have focused on the pre-[[supplementary motor area]] (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement.<ref name=\"Haggard, P. 2008\"/> In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating [[premotor cortex|premotor]] brain regions.<ref name=\"DesmurgetReilly2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Desmurget |first1=M. |last2=Reilly |first2=K.\u00a0T. |last3=Richard |first3=N. |last4=Szathmari |first4=A. |last5=Mottolese |first5=C. |last6=Sirigu |first6=A. |title=Movement Intention After Parietal Cortex Stimulation in Humans |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5928 |year=2009 |pages=811\u2013813 |issn=0036-8075 |doi=10.1126/science.1169896 |pmid=19423830}}</ref> When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.\n\nThis suggests that awareness of an intention to move may literally be the \"sensation\" of the body's early movement, but certainly not the cause. Other studies have at least suggested that \"The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2007 |title=High-frequency oscillations in distributed neural networks reveal the dynamics of human decision making |year=2008 |last1=Guggisberg |first1=Adrian G. |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=1 |pmid=18958227 |last2=Dalal |first2=S.\u00a0S. |last3=Findlay |first3=A.\u00a0M. |last4=Nagarajan |first4=S.\u00a0S. |pages=14 |pmc=2525986}}</ref>\n\nAnother experiment involved an electronic [[ouija]] board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe that they were entirely self-conducted.<ref name=\"WegnerWheatley1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Wheatley |first2=Thalia |title=Apparent mental causation: Sources of the experience of will |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=7 |year=1999 |pages=480\u2013492 |issn=0003-066X |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 |pmid=10424155 |citeseerx=10.1.1.188.8271}}</ref> The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones, and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones, they were more likely to say that they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).\n\nLau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analog-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed that the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16&nbsp;ms, and shifted back the 14&nbsp;ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200&nbsp;ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements.<ref name=\"LauRogers2007\" /> Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.\n\n===Related models===\n\nThe idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of \"forward models of motor control\" (FMMC), which have been used to try to explain [[inner speech]]. FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction, the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see [[self serving bias]]es) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.009 |title=Metacognition of agency across the lifespan |year=2010 |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Janet |last2=Eich |first2=Teal S. |last3=Castel |first3=Alan D. |journal=Cognition |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=267\u2013282 |pmid=20570251}}</ref>\n\nIn this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says \"these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur\".<ref name=HaggardDT/><ref name=Fried/> Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of [[Libertarian free will|contra-causal free will]] even if it were determined.\n\nHow the brain constructs [[consciousness]] is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the [[multiple drafts model]], which argues that there is no central [[Cartesian theater]] where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous \"filmstrip\" comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of [[Cartesian materialism]]<ref>Kenny, A. J. P. (1970). Descartes: philosophical letters (Vol. 94). Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref> that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as [[epiphenomenalism]] argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also [[Philosophy of mind]].)\n\n=== Related brain disorders ===\nVarious brain disorders implicate the role of unconscious brain processes in decision-making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by [[schizophrenia]] seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.<ref name=\"Wegner2003\" /> The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed.<ref name=\"Gazzaniga1984\">{{cite book |last1=Gazzaniga |first1=Michael S. |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |year=1984 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2177-2 |isbn=978-1-4899-2179-6}}</ref> Likewise, people with \"[[alien hand syndrome]]\" are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.<ref name=\"GeschwindIacoboni1995\">{{cite journal |last1=Geschwind |first1=D.\u00a0H. |last2=Iacoboni |first2=M. |last3=Mega |first3=M.\u00a0S. |last4=Zaidel |first4=D.\u00a0W. |last5=Cloughesy |first5=T. |last6=Zaidel |first6=E. |authorlink5=Timothy Cloughesy |title=Alien hand syndrome: Interhemispheric motor disconnection due to a lesion in the midbody of the corpus callosum |journal=Neurology |volume=45 |issue=4 |year=1995 |pages=802\u2013808 |issn=0028-3878 |doi=10.1212/WNL.45.4.802 |pmid=7723974}}</ref>\n\n=== Neural models of voluntary action ===\nA neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.<ref name=\"Haggard, P. 2008\" /> The first involving early preparatory signals ([[basal ganglia]] [[substantia nigra]] and [[striatum]]), prior intention and deliberation (medial [[prefrontal cortex]]), motor preparation/readiness potential ([[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]]), and motor execution ([[primary motor cortex]], [[spinal cord]] and [[muscle]]s). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping ([[premotor cortex]], [[primary motor cortex]], [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal cortex]], and back to the [[premotor cortex]]).

The significance of findings, their meaning, and what conclusions may be drawn from them is a matter of intense debate. The precise role of consciousness in decision making and how that role may differ across types of decisions remains unclear.\n\nThinkers like [[Daniel Dennett]] or [[Alfred Mele]] consider the language used by researchers. They explain that \"free will\" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will are [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]], some not).

Rather, W seems to mark an intention-in-action, quite closely linked to action execution.\n|source = Patrick Haggard discussing<ref name=HaggardDT/> an in-depth experiment by Itzhak Fried<ref name=Fried/>}}\nThe neuroscience of free will encompasses two main fields of study: volition and agency. Volition, the study of voluntary actions, is difficult to define. If we consider human actions as lying along a spectrum of our involvement in initiating the actions, then reflexes would be on one end, and fully voluntary actions would be on the other.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Haggard |first=Patrick |date=2019-01-04 |title=The Neurocognitive Bases of Human Volition |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201328 |doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103348 |pmid=30125134 |issn=0066-4308}}</ref> How these actions are initiated and consciousness\u2019 role in producing them is a major area of study in volition. Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment. Within the neuroscience of free will the sense of agency\u2014the subjective awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's volitional actions\u2014is usually what is studied.\n\nOne significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second or more (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether 12 subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice.<ref name=\"soonetal\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2112 |title=Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain |year=2008 |last1=Soon |first1=Chun Siong |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Heinze |first3=Hans-Jochen |last4=Haynes |first4=John-Dylan |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=543\u20135 |pmid=18408715|citeseerx=10.1.1.520.2204 }}</ref> These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some definitions of \"free will\".\n\nTo be clear, it is very unlikely that a single study could disprove all definitions of free will. Definitions of free will can vary wildly, and each must be considered separately in light of existing [[empirical evidence]]. There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will.<ref name=\"Klemm\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0076-2 |title=Free will debates: Simple experiments are not so simple |year=2010 |last1=Klemm |first1=W.

There is no agreed-upon measure of brain activity corresponding to conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions, making studying processes related to consciousness difficult. The conclusions drawn from measurements that ''have'' been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings represents. Such a dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision because many other mental processes are going on while performing the task.<ref name=\"Klemm\" /> Although early studies mainly used [[electroencephalography]], more recent studies have used [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]],<ref name=\"soonetal\" /> [[Single-unit recording|single-neuron recordings]],<ref name=\"Fried\" /> and other measures.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Di Russo |first=F. |last2=Berchicci |first2=M. |last3=Bozzacchi |first3=C. |last4=Perri |first4=R.\u00a0L. |last5=Pitzalis |first5=S. |last6=Spinelli |first6=D. |date=2017 |title=Beyond the \"Bereitschaftspotential\": Action preparation behind cognitive functions |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |language=en |volume=78 |pages=57\u201381 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.04.019|pmid=28445742 }}</ref> Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest that consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected&nbsp;\u2013 challenging any versions of \"free will\" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.<ref name=\"NatureAim\" />\n\n===Free will as illusion===\n[[File:Playing the piano.jpg|thumb|left|An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously.]]\nIt is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.\n\nIt may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious \"intentions\" have led us astray; it may be the case that we have [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]] by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in [[neurostimulation]], [[brain damage]], but also research into [[introspection illusion]]s. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for [[moral responsibility]]. Neuroscientist and author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is \"intuitive\": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues: \"Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion\".<ref>\"The Moral Landscape\", p.\u00a0112.</ref> Neuroscientist [[Walter Jackson Freeman III]], nevertheless, talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes: \"our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do.\"<ref>Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p.\u00a0139.</ref> To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.\n\nAn important distinction to make is the difference between proximal and distal intentions.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mele |first=Alfred |title=Free Will: Action Theory Meets Neuroscience |date=2007 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MELFWA-8 |work=Intentionality, Deliberation, and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy |editor-last=Lumer |editor-first=C. |publisher=Ashgate |access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref> Proximal intentions are immediate in the sense that they are about acting ''now''. For instance, a decision to raise a hand now or press a button now, as in Libet-style experiments. Distal intentions are delayed in the sense that they are about acting at a later point in time. For instance, deciding to go to the store later. Research has mostly focused on proximal intentions; however, it is unclear to what degree findings will generalize from one sort of intention to the other.\n\n===Relevance of scientific research===\nSome thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think that these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that \"We feel we choose, but we don't\".<ref name=NatureAim/> Researcher [[John-Dylan Haynes]] adds: \"How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?\".<ref name=NatureAim/> Philosophers Walter Glannon and [[Alfred Mele]] think that some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because \"[[free will]]\" can mean many things: it is unclear what someone means when they say \"free will does not exist\". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] notions of free will&nbsp;\u2013 but that is an \"easy target for neuroscientists to knock down\".<ref name=NatureAim/> Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in [[materialistic]] terms. In these cases, \"free will\" means something more like \"not coerced\" or that \"the person could have done otherwise at the last moment\". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making.<ref name=NatureAim/>\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=40%| quoted=1\n|quote= [Some senses of free will] are compatible with what we are learning from science...

[[Benjamin Libet]] investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the \"felt intention\" (or will) to move of experimental subjects.]]\n\nIn a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide ''which hand to move''. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the \"[[lateralized readiness potential]]\" (LRP), an [[event-related potential]] (ERP) component that measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.<ref name=\"HandE\" />\n\nA more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the \"awareness of the intention to move\" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's \"W\"). If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information. However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02254.x |title=We Infer Rather Than Perceive the Moment We Decided to Act |year=2009 |last1=Banks |first1=William P. |last2=Isham |first2=Eve A. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |pages=17\u201321 |pmid=19152537 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention.<ref name=Miller/> In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not.

This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a \"stimulus-response\" circuit and a \"voluntary\" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions.<ref name=\"Haggard, P. 2008\" />\n\nLibet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious \"will\" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their \"will\". Authors have found that [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA]] activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100&nbsp;ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement.<ref name=\"Lau2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Lau |first1=H.

Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the [[readiness potential]]). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.\n\n=====The experiment=====\n[[File:Wijsvinger.jpg|thumb|right|It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain.]]\nMatsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled \"stop-signal\" sound was played at pseudo-random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there ''was'' an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his \"movement genesis\" (or else they would have stopped or \"vetoed\" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.\n\nIn this work, \"movement genesis\" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see [[Benjamin Libet]]).\n\nBy looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness, as seen in the graph below, is called \"T\" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their [[event-related potential]] (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.\n\nThe researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred ''too late'' to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at \u22122.8&nbsp;seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time \"T\" (\u22121.8&nbsp;seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.<ref name=\"Matsuhashi, M. 2008\"/>\n\n=====Analysis and interpretation=====\n[[File:200mW_at_Josef_Odlozil_Memorial_in_Prague_14June2010_064.jpg|thumb|left|A simple \"signalling noise\" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of.]]\nThis study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed \"stop tones\" during the self-paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call \"T\" (time).\n\nTesting the hypothesis that \"conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun\" required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action&nbsp;\u2013 they have passed the action's \"point of no return\". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).\n\n[[File:TimingConsciousIntentiontoMoveHistogram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe that the subject becomes aware of his actions at about 1.8&nbsp;seconds (this is time \"T\"). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as \u22122.8&nbsp;seconds.]]\nThe graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (called \"tone events\" on the graph) on average up until 1.8&nbsp;seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about \u22121.8&nbsp;seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1&nbsp;seconds, meaning that this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (\u22121.8&nbsp;seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to [[Event-related potential|ERP]] measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about \u22122.8&nbsp;seconds on average for this participant. Since T, like Libet's original W, was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.<ref name=\"Matsuhashi, M. 2008\"/>\n\n====Criticisms====\nHaggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing \"a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations\"<ref name=HaggardDT/> such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of [[planning]] has implications for free will, and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our \"conscious self\" has become aware of it does not mean that our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.<ref name=mele>{{cite book\n |author=Alfred R.

First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it ''easy'' to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the [[introspection illusion]]. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to \"veto\" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\n=====The experiment=====\nThe experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic \"go\" button as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/> In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the \"primary response trials\".\n\nThe primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal&nbsp;\u2013 either a \"stop\" or \"decide\" signal. The additional signals occurred after a \"signal delay\" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2&nbsp;seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal, and therefore considered the \"default\" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the \"go\" button) remained.\n\nUpon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the \"go\" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the \"go\" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the \"go\" button or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal (\"decide trials\"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too ''late'' in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).\n\nThose trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600&nbsp;ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600&nbsp;ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400&nbsp;ms.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\nThe participant was asked at the end of those \"decide trials\" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus) or based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data, however, it appears that there was discrepancy between when the user thought that they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses)&nbsp;\u2013 in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought that they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal)&nbsp;\u2013 where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.\n\n=====The rationale=====\n\nKuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed-to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants\u2019 successful decide trials into \"decide go\" and \"decide no-go\", but were not concerned with the no-go trials, since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either.\n[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionTrials.png|thumb|right|400px|The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes]]\n\nKuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the \"failed-to-decide\" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively \u2013 they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the \"successful ''decide''\" trials (where the decision was a \"go\" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important, since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject ''does'' act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\n=====Results and implications=====\n[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionGraph.png|thumb|left|300px|The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled \"successful decide\".]]\nUnsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and \"failed-to-decide\" trials all showed similar RTs: 600&nbsp;ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some \"successful decide\" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400&nbsp;ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as \"successful decide\". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious \"I will not veto\", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain:<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n{{cquote|[The results of the experiment] clearly argue against Libet's assumption that a veto process can be consciously initiated. He used the veto in order to reintroduce the possibility to control the unconsciously initiated actions. But since the subjects are not very accurate in observing when they have [acted impulsively instead of deliberately], the act of vetoing cannot be consciously initiated.}}\n\nIn decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide&nbsp;\u2013 at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but is simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/> Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of \"consciousness\" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously).\n\n=====Criticisms=====\nAfter the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between \"producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming\", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/> To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600&nbsp;ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study).\n\nThe results of the trial in which the so-called \"successful decide\" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response, and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated.<ref name=\"Kuhn Brass 2009\"/>\n\nIt is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously.<ref name=\"Libet 2003\"/> That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by K\u00fchn and Brass using their decide signal.\n\nDaniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur:<ref>\"Freedom Evolves\" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231.</ref><ref>Dennett, D. [http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact''].</ref>\n<blockquote>\nSuppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds&nbsp;\u2014 a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:\n* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick\n* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations\nso that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.\n</blockquote>\n\n=== The point of no return ===\nIn early 2016, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] published an article by researchers in [[Berlin]], Germany, ''The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements'', in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP).<ref>{{Cite journal |title = The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date = 2016-01-26 |issn = 0027-8424 |pmc = 4743787 |pmid = 26668390 |pages = 1080\u20131085 |volume = 113 |issue = 4 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1513569112 |first = Matthias |last = Schultze-Kraft |first2 = Daniel |last2 = Birman |first3 = Marco |last3 = Rusconi |first4 = Carsten |last4 = Allefeld |first5 = Kai |last5 = G\u00f6rgen |first6 = Sven |last6 = D\u00e4hne |first7 = Benjamin |last7 = Blankertz |first8 = John-Dylan |last8 = Haynes}}</ref> The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> is an instance of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neural oscillation|electrical activity]] within the [[motor cortex]], quantified by the use of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is \"getting ready\" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain that this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans:<ref>{{Cite web |title = Neuroscience and Free Will Are Rethinking Their Divorce |url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html |website = Science of Us |access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref> previously, it had been argued<ref>{{Cite web |title = Brain might not stand in the way of free will |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22144-brain-might-not-stand-in-the-way-of-free-will/ |website = New Scientist |access-date = 2016-02-13 |first = Anil |last = Ananthaswamy}}</ref> that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21870/free_will_web.pdf |title = Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism |date = |access-date = |website = Oxford University |publisher = Oxford University Press |last = Swinburne |first = R.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title = Libet Experiments |url = http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html |website = www.informationphilosopher.com |access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref> The study showed that subjects were able to \"override\" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a \"point of no return\": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it at least 200&nbsp;[[millisecond]]s before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] and [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be increased or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.<ref>[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] & [[L\u00fcder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

In order to ensure report timing of conscious \"will\" to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500&nbsp;ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine-learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.\n\nAnother version of the fMRI multivariate pattern analysis experiment was conducted using an abstract decision problem, in an attempt to rule out the possibility of the prediction capabilities being product of capturing a built-up motor urge.<ref name=\"SoonHe2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Soon |first1=C.

Other studies have at least suggested that \"The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2007 |title=High-frequency oscillations in distributed neural networks reveal the dynamics of human decision making |year=2008 |last1=Guggisberg |first1=Adrian G. |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=1 |pmid=18958227 |last2=Dalal |first2=S.\u00a0S. |last3=Findlay |first3=A.\u00a0M. |last4=Nagarajan |first4=S.\u00a0S. |pages=14 |pmc=2525986}}</ref>\n\nAnother experiment involved an electronic [[ouija]] board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe that they were entirely self-conducted.<ref name=\"WegnerWheatley1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Wheatley |first2=Thalia |title=Apparent mental causation: Sources of the experience of will |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=7 |year=1999 |pages=480\u2013492 |issn=0003-066X |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 |pmid=10424155 |citeseerx=10.1.1.188.8271}}</ref> The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones, and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones, they were more likely to say that they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).\n\nLau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analog-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed that the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16&nbsp;ms, and shifted back the 14&nbsp;ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200&nbsp;ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements.<ref name=\"LauRogers2007\" /> Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.\n\n===Related models===\n\nThe idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of \"forward models of motor control\" (FMMC), which have been used to try to explain [[inner speech]]. FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction, the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see [[self serving bias]]es) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.009 |title=Metacognition of agency across the lifespan |year=2010 |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Janet |last2=Eich |first2=Teal S. |last3=Castel |first3=Alan D. |journal=Cognition |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=267\u2013282 |pmid=20570251}}</ref>\n\nIn this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says \"these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur\".<ref name=HaggardDT/><ref name=Fried/> Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of [[Libertarian free will|contra-causal free will]] even if it were determined.\n\nHow the brain constructs [[consciousness]] is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the [[multiple drafts model]], which argues that there is no central [[Cartesian theater]] where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous \"filmstrip\" comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of [[Cartesian materialism]] that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as [[epiphenomenalism]] argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also [[Philosophy of mind]].)\n\n=== Related brain disorders ===\nVarious brain disorders implicate the role of unconscious brain processes in decision-making tasks. Auditory hallucinations produced by [[schizophrenia]] seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.<ref name=\"Wegner2003\" /> The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed.<ref name=\"Gazzaniga1984\">{{cite book |last1=Gazzaniga |first1=Michael S. |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |year=1984 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2177-2 |isbn=978-1-4899-2179-6}}</ref> Likewise, people with \"[[alien hand syndrome]]\" are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.<ref name=\"GeschwindIacoboni1995\">{{cite journal |last1=Geschwind |first1=D.\u00a0H. |last2=Iacoboni |first2=M. |last3=Mega |first3=M.\u00a0S. |last4=Zaidel |first4=D.\u00a0W. |last5=Cloughesy |first5=T. |last6=Zaidel |first6=E. |authorlink5=Timothy Cloughesy |title=Alien hand syndrome: Interhemispheric motor disconnection due to a lesion in the midbody of the corpus callosum |journal=Neurology |volume=45 |issue=4 |year=1995 |pages=802\u2013808 |issn=0028-3878 |doi=10.1212/WNL.45.4.802 |pmid=7723974}}</ref>\n\n=== Neural models of voluntary action ===\nA neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.<ref name=\"Haggard, P. 2008\" /> The first involving early preparatory signals ([[basal ganglia]] [[substantia nigra]] and [[striatum]]), prior intention and deliberation (medial [[prefrontal cortex]]), motor preparation/readiness potential ([[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]]), and motor execution ([[primary motor cortex]], [[spinal cord]] and [[muscle]]s). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping ([[premotor cortex]], [[primary motor cortex]], [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal cortex]], and back to the [[premotor cortex]]). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input (\"when decision\"), motivations/reasons for actions (early \"whether decision\"), task and action selection (\"what decision\"), a final predictive check (late \"whether decision\") and action execution.\n\nAnother neural model for voluntary action also involves what, when, and whether (WWW) based decisions.<ref name=\"BrassLynn2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Brass |first1=Marcel |last2=Lynn |first2=Margaret T. |last3=Demanet |first3=Jelle |last4=Rigoni |first4=Davide |title=Imaging volition: what the brain can tell us about the will |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=229 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=301\u2013312 |issn=0014-4819 |doi=10.1007/s00221-013-3472-x |pmid=23515626}}</ref>\nThe \"what\" component of decisions is considered a function of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], which is involved in conflict monitoring.<ref name=\"MuellerBrass2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Mueller |first1=Veronika A. |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Waszak |first3=Florian |last4=Prinz |first4=Wolfgang |title=The role of the preSMA and the rostral cingulate zone in internally selected actions |journal=NeuroImage |volume=37 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=1354\u20131361 |issn=1053-8119 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.06.018 |pmid=17681798}}</ref> The timing (\"when\") of the decisions are considered a function of the [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]], which is involved in motor preparation.<ref name=\"Krieghoff2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Krieghoff |first1=Veronika |title=Dissociating what and when of intentional actions |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=3 |pages=3 |year=2009 |issn=1662-5161 |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.003.2009 |pmid=19277217 |pmc=2654019}}</ref>\nFinally, the \"whether\" component is considered a function of the [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] medial [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref name=\"BrassLynn2013\"/>\n\n=== Prospection ===\n{{Main|Prospection}}\n[[Martin Seligman]] and others criticize the classical approach in science that views animals and humans as \"driven by the past\" and suggest instead that people and animals draw on experience to evaluate prospects they face and act accordingly.
