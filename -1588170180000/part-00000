Pastrana also raced in the 2000 [[Motocross des Nations]]. He moved up to the 250cc class in 2002. His stand-up style, ability to spot jump combinations and great speed through the whoops make him easy to spot on the track. Although Pastrana has never won a 250cc race, his kindness to the fans and love of the sport still make him one of the most popular riders of all time. The Freestyle stunt riding started at a young age. At 13 years old Pastrana was already performing stunts during motocross racing, keeping the fans enthused and, later in life, leading to his career in [[freestyle motocross]].<!--POV?--> Pastrana has always raced and competed on Suzuki motorcycles, and remains fiercely loyal to the brand. He races with Team Cernic's Suzuki. All of his motorcycles and rally cars carry the number 199. He even sponsored a [[Monster Jam]] truck called [[Pastrana 199]] and ''Nitro Circus'', after the show on MTV. On October 3, 2014, Pastrana competed in the first ever Red Bull Straight Rhythm competition, riding in the Open Class on a Suzuki RM-Z 450 with a Honda CR500 engine swap. He dubbed the bike the RM-Zilla.

Before this event, he had won a bronze medal in Best Trick, performing a One-Handed 360, a Superman Seat Grab, and an Indian Air Back flip.\n* 2005&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won his fifth gold medal in Freestyle and also attempted the first-ever Backflip Barspin on a motorcycle, however the bike failed and he resorted to a regular bike and performed a Backflip Saran Wrap to take a silver medal in Best Trick.\n* 2006&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana became the third athlete to win three gold medals at a single X Games event. He won golds in MotoX Best Trick, MotoX Freestyle, and Rally Car Racing. Pastrana also performed the first Double Backflip in competition, scoring a 98.60, the highest score in the Best Trick competition at X Games.\n* 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took bronze in Rally after sliding into the other driver's area while inside the Home Depot Center. He was disqualified but retained his medal. He also competed in the first MotoX Racing event at X Games, but did not achieve a medal after two false starts in the heat race and last-chance qualifier.\n* 2008&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took gold in Rally and competed in the Speed & Style event, but did not place.\n* 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana attempted a rodeo 720 at X Games 15 in the Moto X Best Trick Event. He crashed on his first attempt and withdrew from his second after experiencing blurred vision. He placed 4th for his efforts.  He took silver in Rally after being defeated by rookie and former [[IndyCar]]/[[Indy 500]] champion [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]. On November 8, Pastrana landed the famous Rodeo 720, and filmed it in his newest movie, ''Nitro Circus&nbsp;\u2013 Country Fried''. Once he landed the trick, he named it the TP7, due to the fact that he was 20 degrees short of 720.\n* 2010&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won Moto X Freestyle, landing yet another Double Backflip, the first one done at an X Games Freestyle. Pastrana also won Moto X Speed & Style, beating silver medalist Nate Adams by a landslide. Pastrana had problems with his Rally Car during competition, costing him gold at Rally Car Racing and a chance to compete in the new event, Super Rally.\n* 2011&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana launched \"Pastranathon\"; which included Best Trick, a race at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis|Lucas Oil Raceway]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]], and RallyCross at [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles. However, Pastranathon seemed to be done when, in XGames Best Trick, Pastrana attempted the Rodeo 720, also known as the TP7, and failed, landing on his right leg. He broke his foot and ankle, and was taken to a local hospital. Pastrana was thought to be done, and backed out of the NASCAR race. His team worked diligently to get Pastrana in the RallyCross event. A special hand-controlled device was made for the steering wheel, and Pastrana had to relearn to drive the car using the new controls. Pastrana won a qualifying event, then finished 4th in the final after a crash on the last lap.\n* 2012&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana participated in another RallyCross event. For this, he sent a challenge video to [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], who was at that time the eight-time-consecutive [[World Rally Championship]] champion, asking him to race against him in the event. His invitation worked well; Loeb not only participated, but his team made a new vehicle specifically for the event. Pastrana's effort ended up only to be in vain when he was forced to retire by an accident caused by Andy Scott in the very first heat of the race. Pastrana could only watch Loeb \u2013 who dominated the whole race and got his first gold medal \u2013 in the sideways during the remainder of the event, and never actually raced against him as he had planned for.\n* 2015&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana made his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] debut at [[X Games Austin 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/article/12927656/x-games-austin-preview-road-truck-racing|title=Off-Road Truck Racing: Teen Drivers|work=[[X Games]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> Pastrana finished last in his heat race, and was forced to run the last-chance qualifier, finishing second and advancing to the final race; he finished ninth in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/results/400766423/off-road-truck-racing|title=Off Road Truck Racing|work=[[X Games]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Rallying==\n[[File:Alexrally.JPG|thumb|Pastrana's [[Subaru Impreza WRX STI]].]]\n\nIn 2003, Pastrana opened a [[rallying]] career in the [[Race of Champions]], and began driving for the [[Subaru]]-backed Vermont SportsCar rally team in 2004. Starting in 2006, Pastrana was signed by Subaru to lead their new Subru Rally TeaUSA, being paired once again with veteran co-driver [[Christian Edstrom]]. On August 5, 2006 Pastrana won the gold medal in the first rally car competition at the X Games, edging out rally legend [[Colin McRae]]  by 0.53 seconds after McRae rolled his car through the last jump.\n\nPastrana and Edstrom clinched the 2006 [[Rally America]] National Series overall and open class championship on October 22, 2006 during day one of the Lake Superior Performance Rally. The team finished out the 2006 series with another first-place victory at the Wild West Rally in Olympia, Washington on December 31, 2006.\n\nOn December 16, 2006 Pastrana competed at the [[2006 Race of Champions]] at the [[Stade de France]] in Paris. He represented the United States in the Nations' Cup by himself, after injuries forced teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] and his replacement [[Scott Speed]] to withdraw.\n\nFebruary 19, 2007 brought news that Pastrana's longtime co-driver Edstrom had announced a sabbatical to concentrate on his career and family. Although former McRae co-driver [[Derek Ringer]] competed with Pastrana for the 100 Acre Wood Rally in Salem, Missouri and Rally America, he did not announce a permanent co-driver.\n\n[[File:Travis Pastrana - 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally.jpg|thumb|Pastrana driving a classic Ford Escort Mk1 at the 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages.]]\nIn September 2008, Pastrana took part in the ''Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally'', a round of the [[Scottish Rally Championship]] centred in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in Scotland.

He was one of a number of celebrity drivers to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.\n\nOn August 29, 2009 Pastrana claimed the overall victory at [[Ojibwe Forests Rally]], his fifth of the 2009 [[Rally America]] season.

During the 2009 World Finals the \"Pastrana 199\" truck changed its name to \"Nitro Circus\". Pastrana himself competed in the freestyle competition of the event debuting the \"Nitro Circus\" truck, finishing in a three-way tie for 5th place in a field of 24 trucks. On February 27, 2010 in Jacksonville, Florida, Cam McQueen successfully executed a backflip in the Nitro Circus monster truck during the freestyle competition, making Nitro Circus the first to do so in competition. The \"Nitro Circus\" monster truck made its final appearance and was retired after the 2011 Monster Jam season.\n\n===Vegas jumps===\nTravis Pastrana paid tribute to his role model growing up, legendary daredevil/stuntman [[Evel Knievel]]&nbsp;by breaking a few of his records. On July 8, 2018, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Pastrana safety cleared three record-breaking big jumps, which consisted of 52 cars, 16 buses, and a fountain respectively, for a total of 484 feet of jumps in a single night.\n\nThe first jump over the cars was at 143 feet, the second jump over the buses was at 192 feet, and the third jump over the [[Caesar's Palace]] Fountain \u2014 a jump that Knievel himself wasn't able to land in 1967, when he crushed his pelvis and his femur \u2014 was at 149 feet, performed with more elevation. These feats were televised live on [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]].<ref>http://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2018/07/08/breaking-news-travis-pastrana-successfully-completes-all-three-of-evel-knievels-most-famous-jumps/</ref>\n\n==Injuries==\n<blockquote>\n''\u201cI don\u2019t remember most of the injuries, there have been too many.\u201d'' \u2013 Travis Pastrana<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantamotorspeedway.com/media/news/thrill-nascar-ams-excites-pastrana.html|title=Thrill of NASCAR, AMS Excites Pastrana|work=[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724084148/http://www.atlantamotorspeedway.com/media/news/thrill-nascar-ams-excites-pastrana.html|archive-date=July 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nInjuries have often taken Pastrana off the circuit for weeks or months at a time. His medical records include: a dislocated spine, he has torn his ACL, PCL, LCL, MCL and [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his left knee, broken his [[tibia]] and [[fibula]], he has had surgery on his left wrist twice, left thumb once, two surgeries on his back, one on his right elbow, nine on his left knee, six on the right knee, one shoulder surgery which left him with the only piece of metal he has in his body.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070129115200/http://www.lat34.com/dew_tour/why_travis_pastrana_is Why Travis Pastrana is The Man]. lat34.com.

He came up short, landing on the top of the front side of the landing ramp and the motorcycle decelerated from 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) to {{convert|0|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in less than one second.{{Citation needed|reason=Source does not mention impact speed or time of deceleration.|date=July 2016}} The bike was stuck into the dirt ramp with the front wheel just over the top and the crankcase smashed into the dirt deep enough to support the entire motorcycle upright. He was severely injured, his spine having been separated from his pelvis. It also left him in a [[wheelchair]] for three months.<ref>[http://360guide.info/crazy-stuff/backflip-travis-pastrana-and-aaron-fotherinham.html?Itemid=63 Backflip: Travis Pastrana and Aaron Fotherinham \u2013 360Guide]. 360guide.info.

He also adds that according to doctors, only three people in the U.S. have ever lived after such an injury. It was a long and difficult recovery. Pastrana would routinely ride wheelies in his wheelchair around the hospital and therapy areas. While in the wheelchair recovering, he vowed to continue motorcycle jumping. He was also injured in July 2011 while competing at the X Games when his motorcycle did not rotate to the landing position, crushing his ankle and causing a fracture. However, Pastrana was back in his Subaru Impreza and competing in the Rally Cross final where he overshot the corner, forcing himself into the wall; on-board footage shows his leg in plaster being slammed against the wheel well, much to his discomfort.<ref>[http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/news/110729/pastrana-debut-delayed-injury/index.html Injury scuttles Pastrana's Nationwide debut \u2013 July 29, 2011 \u2013 NASCAR.COM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803130428/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/news/110729/pastrana-debut-delayed-injury/index.html |date=August 3, 2011 }}.

Pastrana also raced in the 2000 [[Motocross des Nations]]. He moved up to the 250cc class in 2002. His stand-up style, ability to spot jump combinations and great speed through the whoops make him easy to spot on the track. Although Pastrana has never won a 250cc race, his kindness to the fans and love of the sport still make him one of the most popular riders of all time. The Freestyle stunt riding started at a young age. At 13 years old Pastrana was already performing stunts during motocross racing, keeping the fans enthused and, later in life, leading to his career in [[freestyle motocross]].<!--POV?--> Pastrana has always raced and competed on Suzuki motorcycles, and remains fiercely loyal to the brand. He races with Team Cernic's Suzuki. All of his motorcycles and rally cars carry the number 199. He even sponsored a [[Monster Jam]] truck called [[Pastrana 199]] and ''Nitro Circus'', after the show on MTV. On October 3, 2014, Pastrana competed in the first ever Red Bull Straight Rhythm competition, riding in the Open Class on a Suzuki RM-Z 450 with a Honda CR500 engine swap. He dubbed the bike the RM-Zilla.

Pastrana also performed the first Double Backflip in competition, scoring a 98.60, the highest score in the Best Trick competition at X Games.\n* 2007&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took bronze in Rally after sliding into the other driver's area while inside the Home Depot Center. He was disqualified but retained his medal. He also competed in the first MotoX Racing event at X Games, but did not achieve a medal after two false starts in the heat race and last-chance qualifier.\n* 2008&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana took gold in Rally and competed in the Speed & Style event, but did not place.\n* 2009&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana attempted a rodeo 720 at X Games 15 in the Moto X Best Trick Event. He crashed on his first attempt and withdrew from his second after experiencing blurred vision. He placed 4th for his efforts.  He took silver in Rally after being defeated by rookie and former [[IndyCar]]/[[Indy 500]] champion [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]. On November 8, Pastrana landed the famous Rodeo 720, and filmed it in his newest movie, ''Nitro Circus&nbsp;\u2013 Country Fried''. Once he landed the trick, he named it the TP7, due to the fact that he was 20 degrees short of 720.\n* 2010&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana won Moto X Freestyle, landing yet another Double Backflip, the first one done at an X Games Freestyle. Pastrana also won Moto X Speed & Style, beating silver medalist Nate Adams by a landslide. Pastrana had problems with his Rally Car during competition, costing him gold at Rally Car Racing and a chance to compete in the new event, Super Rally.\n* 2011&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana launched \"Pastranathon\"; which included Best Trick, a race at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis|Lucas Oil Raceway]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]], and RallyCross at [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles. However, Pastranathon seemed to be done when, in XGames Best Trick, Pastrana attempted the Rodeo 720, also known as the TP7, and failed, landing on his right leg. He broke his foot and ankle, and was taken to a local hospital. Pastrana was thought to be done, and backed out of the NASCAR race. His team worked diligently to get Pastrana in the RallyCross event. A special hand-controlled device was made for the steering wheel, and Pastrana had to relearn to drive the car using the new controls. Pastrana won a qualifying event, then finished 4th in the final after a crash on the last lap.\n* 2012&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana participated in another RallyCross event. For this, he sent a challenge video to [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]], who was at that time the eight-time-consecutive [[World Rally Championship]] champion, asking him to race against him in the event. His invitation worked well; Loeb not only participated, but his team made a new vehicle specifically for the event. Pastrana's effort ended up only to be in vain when he was forced to retire by an accident caused by Andy Scott in the very first heat of the race. Pastrana could only watch Loeb \u2013 who dominated the whole race and got his first gold medal \u2013 in the sideways during the remainder of the event, and never actually raced against him as he had planned for.\n* 2015&nbsp;\u2013 Pastrana made his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] debut at [[X Games Austin 2015]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/article/12927656/x-games-austin-preview-road-truck-racing|title=Off-Road Truck Racing: Teen Drivers|work=[[X Games]]|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}</ref> Pastrana finished last in his heat race, and was forced to run the last-chance qualifier, finishing second and advancing to the final race; he finished ninth in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/xgames/events/2015/austin/results/400766423/off-road-truck-racing|title=Off Road Truck Racing|work=[[X Games]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Rallying==\n[[File:Alexrally.JPG|thumb|Pastrana's [[Subaru Impreza WRX STI]].]]\n\nIn 2003, Pastrana opened a [[rallying]] career in the [[Race of Champions]], and began driving for the [[Subaru]]-backed Vermont SportsCar rally team in 2004. Starting in 2006, Pastrana was signed by Subaru to lead their new Subaru Rally Team USA, being paired once again with veteran co-driver [[Christian Edstrom]]. On August 5, 2006 Pastrana won the gold medal in the first rally car competition at the X Games, edging out rally legend [[Colin McRae]]  by 0.53 seconds after McRae rolled his car through the last jump.\n\nPastrana and Edstrom clinched the 2006 [[Rally America]] National Series overall and open class championship on October 22, 2006 during day one of the Lake Superior Performance Rally. The team finished out the 2006 series with another first-place victory at the Wild West Rally in Olympia, Washington on December 31, 2006.\n\nOn December 16, 2006 Pastrana competed at the [[2006 Race of Champions]] at the [[Stade de France]] in Paris. He represented the United States in the Nations' Cup by himself, after injuries forced teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] and his replacement [[Scott Speed]] to withdraw.\n\nFebruary 19, 2007 brought news that Pastrana's longtime co-driver Edstrom had announced a sabbatical to concentrate on his career and family. Although former McRae co-driver [[Derek Ringer]] competed with Pastrana for the 100 Acre Wood Rally in Salem, Missouri and Rally America, he did not announce a permanent co-driver.\n\n[[File:Travis Pastrana - 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally.jpg|thumb|Pastrana driving a classic Ford Escort Mk1 at the 2008 Colin McRae Forest Stages.]]\nIn September 2008, Pastrana took part in the ''Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally'', a round of the [[Scottish Rally Championship]] centred in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in Scotland.

Pastrana himself competed in the freestyle competition of the event debuting the \"Nitro Circus\" truck, finishing in a three-way tie for 5th place in a field of 24 trucks. On February 27, 2010 in Jacksonville, Florida, Cam McQueen successfully executed a backflip in the Nitro Circus monster truck during the freestyle competition, making Nitro Circus the first to do so in competition. The \"Nitro Circus\" monster truck made its final appearance and was retired after the 2011 Monster Jam season.\n\n===Vegas jumps===\nTravis Pastrana paid tribute to his role model growing up, legendary daredevil/stuntman [[Evel Knievel]]&nbsp;by breaking a few of his records. On July 8, 2018, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Pastrana safety cleared three record-breaking big jumps, which consisted of 52 cars, 16 buses, and a fountain respectively, for a total of 484 feet of jumps in a single night.\n\nThe first jump over the cars was at 143 feet, the second jump over the buses was at 192 feet, and the third jump over the [[Caesar's Palace]] Fountain \u2014 a jump that Knievel himself wasn't able to land in 1967, when he crushed his pelvis and his femur \u2014 was at 149 feet, performed with more elevation. These feats were televised live on [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]].<ref>http://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2018/07/08/breaking-news-travis-pastrana-successfully-completes-all-three-of-evel-knievels-most-famous-jumps/</ref>\n\n==Injuries==\n<blockquote>\n''\u201cI don\u2019t remember most of the injuries, there have been too many.\u201d'' \u2013 Travis Pastrana<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantamotorspeedway.com/media/news/thrill-nascar-ams-excites-pastrana.html|title=Thrill of NASCAR, AMS Excites Pastrana|work=[[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724084148/http://www.atlantamotorspeedway.com/media/news/thrill-nascar-ams-excites-pastrana.html|archive-date=July 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nInjuries have often taken Pastrana off the circuit for weeks or months at a time. His medical records include: a dislocated spine, he has torn his ACL, PCL, LCL, MCL and [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his left knee, broken his [[tibia]] and [[fibula]], he has had surgery on his left wrist twice, left thumb once, two surgeries on his back, one on his right elbow, nine on his left knee, six on the right knee, one shoulder surgery which left him with the only piece of metal he has in his body.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070129115200/http://www.lat34.com/dew_tour/why_travis_pastrana_is Why Travis Pastrana is The Man]. lat34.com.

He came up short, landing on the top of the front side of the landing ramp and the motorcycle decelerated from 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) to {{convert|0|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in less than one second.{{Citation needed|reason=Source does not mention impact speed or time of deceleration.|date=July 2016}} The bike was stuck into the dirt ramp with the front wheel just over the top and the crankcase smashed into the dirt deep enough to support the entire motorcycle upright. He was severely injured, his spine having been separated from his pelvis. It also left him in a [[wheelchair]] for three months.<ref>[http://360guide.info/crazy-stuff/backflip-travis-pastrana-and-aaron-fotherinham.html?Itemid=63 Backflip: Travis Pastrana and Aaron Fotherinham \u2013 360Guide]. 360guide.info.

He also adds that according to doctors, only three people in the U.S. have ever lived after such an injury. It was a long and difficult recovery. Pastrana would routinely ride wheelies in his wheelchair around the hospital and therapy areas. While in the wheelchair recovering, he vowed to continue motorcycle jumping. He was also injured in July 2011 while competing at the X Games when his motorcycle did not rotate to the landing position, crushing his ankle and causing a fracture. However, Pastrana was back in his Subaru Impreza and competing in the Rally Cross final where he overshot the corner, forcing himself into the wall; on-board footage shows his leg in plaster being slammed against the wheel well, much to his discomfort.<ref>[http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/news/110729/pastrana-debut-delayed-injury/index.html Injury scuttles Pastrana's Nationwide debut \u2013 July 29, 2011 \u2013 NASCAR.COM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803130428/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/news/110729/pastrana-debut-delayed-injury/index.html |date=August 3, 2011 }}.

It was founded in 1893 by [[John Haden Badley]] in reaction to the limitations of conventional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] schools. \n\nSince 1900 the school has been on an {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in the village of [[Steep, Hampshire|Steep]], near [[Petersfield]], Hampshire. As well as playing fields, orchards, woodland, pasture and a nature reserve, the campus also boasts two [[listed building|Grade 1 listed]] [[arts and crafts movement|arts and crafts]] buildings designed by [[Ernest Gimson]], the Lupton Hall (1911),  which was  co-designed, built and largely financed by ex-pupil [[Geoffrey Lupton]], and  the Memorial Library (1921). There are also three contemporary award-winning buildings: the Olivier Theatre (1997) designed by [[Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios]], the Orchard Building (2005) by [[Walters & Cohen]] and the Art and Design Building (2017) also by [[Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bedales.org.uk/the-campus.html |title=Bedales School Campus |publisher=Bedales.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 March 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308073757/http://www.bedales.org.uk/the-campus.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:JHB.jpg|thumb|John Haden Badley, founder of the school]]\n[[File:Bedales School, Steep. - geograph.org.uk - 2380.jpg|thumb|right|Bedales School]]\nThe school was started in 1893 by John H Badley and Oswald B Powell after they had been introduced to each other by [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson]], whom they both knew from their Cambridge days. Their wives, Amy Badley and Winifred Powell were an essential part of the team. A house called Bedales was rented just outside Lindfield, near [[Haywards Heath]]. In 1899 Badley and Powell (the latter borrowing heavily from his father, the Vicar of Bisham) purchased a [[country estate]] near Steep and constructed a purpose-built school, including state of the art electric light, which opened in 1900. The site has been extensively developed over the past century, including the relocation of a number of historic [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] [[Timber framing|timber frame]] barns. A [[preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], Dunhurst, was started in 1902 on [[Montessori]] principles (and was visited in 1919 by [[Maria Montessori|Dr Montessori]] herself), and a primary school, Dunannie, was added in the 1950s.\n\nBadley took a non-denominational approach to religion and the school has never had a chapel: its relatively secular teaching made it attractive in its early days to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformists]], agnostics, [[Quakers]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|liberal Jews]], who formed a significant element of its early intake. The school was also well known and popular in some [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual circles with connections to the [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|Wedgwoods, Darwins]], [[Huxley family|Huxleys]], and [[Trevelyan family|Trevelyans]]. Books such as ''A quoi tient la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 des Anglo-Saxons?'' and ''L'Education nouvelle'' popularised the school on [[the Continent]], leading to a cosmopolitan intake of Russian and other European children in the 1920s.\n\nBedales was originally a small and intimate school: the 1900 buildings were designed for 150 pupils. Under a necessary programme of expansion and modernisation in the 1960s and 1970s under the headmastership of Tim Slack, the senior school grew from 240 pupils in 1966 to 340, thereafter increasing to some 465.\n\n\n==Co-education==\nBedales has [[Mixed-sex education|educated boys and girls together]] since 1898. The school's particular emphasis on arts, crafts and drama can be seen as a direct and deliberate legacy of this early co-education theory, as explained by one of the school's most influential masters, Geoffrey Crump, in his book ''Bedales Since the War'' (1936):{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n:\"It is not enough to preach [[self control]] to a girl of fifteen who is just beginning to realise her power over the other sex, or to a boy of seventeen who is seriously disturbed by a girl of his own age. They don't want to be self-controlled. But one of the most valuable things that psychology has taught us is the importance of [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], and here is our chance. Adolescence is a time when it is natural to be active, and it is also an awakening to the power of beauty, beauty of all kinds \u2013 in colour form, movement, sound and spiritual aspiration. The boy and girl see these first in their human counterparts, and if left to themselves will hardly look anywhere else. But it is now that they are ready for the beauty of poetry, music, painting, drawing, and above all the earth around them, and these they must be given without stint&nbsp;... The tendency of modern civilisation is to hurry on the awakening of sexual consciousness \u2013 a fact that is much to be deplored, and that makes the tasks of all schoolmasters and schoolmistresses far more difficult. Children now see erotic films and posters and read erotic books at an age when we had not thought about such things. They hear erotic dance-music, with its imbecile sentimental words, wherever they go. The attitude of a city-bred boy of fourteen to a city-bred girl of fourteen is quite different from what it was ten years ago.\"\n\n==Current management==\n\nThe term 'Bedales Schools' incorporates Bedales itself (for ages 13\u201318), as well as Dunhurst (7\u201313) and Dunnannie (3\u20137). Since September 2018, Magnus Bashaarat holds the title of 'Head of Bedales Schools', although each of the junior schools has a separate Head as well. His role involves overseeing management and directing the long-term future and ethos of the school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bedales.org.uk/media/77/377-bpa-mins-11oct08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 January 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143917/http://www.bedales.org.uk/media/77/377-bpa-mins-11oct08.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBedales (senior) School also has a Senior Deputy (Operational and Pastoral), Louise Wilson (BA, PGCE London (King's College), MA Bath);

It was founded in 1893 by [[John Haden Badley]] in reaction to the limitations of conventional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] schools. \n\nSince 1900 the school has been on an {{convert|120|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in the village of [[Steep, Hampshire|Steep]], near [[Petersfield]], Hampshire. As well as playing fields, orchards, woodland, pasture and a nature reserve, the campus also boasts two [[listed building|Grade 1 listed]] [[arts and crafts movement|arts and crafts]] buildings designed by [[Ernest Gimson]], the Lupton Hall (1911),  which was  co-designed, built and largely financed by ex-pupil [[Geoffrey Lupton]], and  the Memorial Library (1921). There are also three contemporary award-winning buildings: the Olivier Theatre (1997) designed by [[Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios]], the Orchard Building (2005) by [[Walters & Cohen]] and the Art and Design Building (2017) also by [[Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bedales.org.uk/the-campus.html |title=Bedales School Campus |publisher=Bedales.org.uk |date= |accessdate=20 March 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308073757/http://www.bedales.org.uk/the-campus.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:JHB.jpg|thumb|John Haden Badley, founder of the school]]\n[[File:Bedales School, Steep. - geograph.org.uk - 2380.jpg|thumb|right|Bedales School]]\nThe school was started in 1893 by John H Badley and Oswald B Powell after they had been introduced to each other by [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson]], whom they both knew from their Cambridge days. Their wives, Amy Badley and Winifred Powell were an essential part of the team. A house called Bedales was rented just outside Lindfield, near [[Haywards Heath]]. In 1899 Badley and Powell (the latter borrowing heavily from his father, the Vicar of Bisham) purchased a [[country estate]] near Steep and constructed a purpose-built school, including state of the art electric light, which opened in 1900. The site has been extensively developed over the past century, including the relocation of a number of historic [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] [[Timber framing|timber frame]] barns. A [[preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], Dunhurst, was started in 1902 on [[Montessori]] principles (and was visited in 1919 by [[Maria Montessori|Dr Montessori]] herself), and a primary school, Dunannie, was added in the 1950s.\n\nBadley took a non-denominational approach to religion and the school has never had a chapel: its relatively secular teaching made it attractive in its early days to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformists]], agnostics, [[Quakers]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|liberal Jews]], who formed a significant element of its early intake. The school was also well known and popular in some [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual circles with connections to the [[Darwin\u2013Wedgwood family|Wedgwoods, Darwins]], [[Huxley family|Huxleys]], and [[Trevelyan family|Trevelyans]]. Books such as ''A quoi tient la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 des Anglo-Saxons?'' and ''L'Education nouvelle'' popularised the school on [[the Continent]], leading to a cosmopolitan intake of Russian and other European children in the 1920s.\n\nBedales was originally a small and intimate school: the 1900 buildings were designed for 150 pupils. Under a necessary programme of expansion and modernisation in the 1960s and 1970s under the headmastership of Tim Slack, the senior school grew from 240 pupils in 1966 to 340, thereafter increasing to some 465.\n\n\n==Co-education==\nBedales has [[Mixed-sex education|educated boys and girls together]] since 1898. The school's particular emphasis on arts, crafts and drama can be seen as a direct and deliberate legacy of this early co-education theory, as explained by one of the school's most influential masters, Geoffrey Crump, in his book ''Bedales Since the War'' (1936):{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n:\"It is not enough to preach [[self control]] to a girl of fifteen who is just beginning to realise her power over the other sex, or to a boy of seventeen who is seriously disturbed by a girl of his own age. They don't want to be self-controlled. But one of the most valuable things that psychology has taught us is the importance of [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], and here is our chance. Adolescence is a time when it is natural to be active, and it is also an awakening to the power of beauty, beauty of all kinds \u2013 in colour form, movement, sound and spiritual aspiration. The boy and girl see these first in their human counterparts, and if left to themselves will hardly look anywhere else. But it is now that they are ready for the beauty of poetry, music, painting, drawing, and above all the earth around them, and these they must be given without stint&nbsp;... The tendency of modern civilisation is to hurry on the awakening of sexual consciousness \u2013 a fact that is much to be deplored, and that makes the tasks of all schoolmasters and schoolmistresses far more difficult. Children now see erotic films and posters and read erotic books at an age when we had not thought about such things. They hear erotic dance-music, with its imbecile sentimental words, wherever they go.

The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Intro|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for Restoration|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113212/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|archivedate=2011-10-10}} Updated 12/113/2013</ref>\n\nIn the United States restoration is different from preservation (conservation in UK) by allowing the removal of historic materials to create an accurate portrayal of a particular time period, not necessarily the original or final time periods.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Valletta Gro\u00dfmeisterpalast.JPG|thumb|The [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]], [[Malta]] being restored in 2011.]]\nIn the field of [[historic preservation]], building restoration is the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic building, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value. Restoration work may be performed to reverse decay, or alterations made to the building(s)\n\nSince Historic Building Conservation is more about fostering a deep appreciation for these famous structures and learning more about why they exist, rather than just keeping historic structures standing tall and looking as beautiful as ever, true historic building preservation aims for a high level of authenticity, accurately replicating historic materials and techniques as much as possible, ideally using modern techniques only in a concealed manner where they will not compromise the historic character of the structure's appearance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearlbaycorp.com/historicrestorations.html | title=Historic Building Restoration, Preservation, and Renovation | publisher=Pearl Bay Corporation | accessdate=28 May 2015 | author=Van Sanford, Scott}}</ref>\n\nFor instance a restoration might involve the replacement of outdated heating and cooling systems with newer ones, or the installation of climate controls that never existed at the time of building after careful study. [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the complex of former royal palaces outside [[St Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] is an example of this sort of work.\n\nExterior and interior paint colors present similar problems over time. Air pollution, acid rain, and sun take a toll, and often many layers of different paint exist. [[Historic paint analysis]] of old paint layers now allow a corresponding chemical recipe and color to be re-produced. But this is often only a beginning as many of the original materials are either unstable or in many cases environmentally unsound. Many eighteenth century greens were made with arsenic and lead, materials no longer allowed in paints. Another problem occurs when the original pigment came from a material no longer available. For example, in the early to mid-19th century, some browns were produced from bits of ground [[mummy|mummies]]. In cases like this the standards allow other materials with similar appearance to be used and organizations like Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] will work with a historic paint color re-creator s to replicate the antique paints in durable, stable, and environmentally safe materials. In the United States the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] is a helpful resource. The [[polychrome]] painted interiors of the [[Vermont State House]] and [[Boston Public Library]] are examples of this type of heritage restoration.\n\n==Secretary of Interiors standards for restoration==\n[[File:Nice brickwork - geograph.org.uk - 1034247.jpg|thumb|Not a good example of restoration, a glaringly different material of bricks in a stone wall. Attribution: Paul Dickson]]\nIn the United States, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] is the head of the [[National Park Service]] which owns and maintains thousands of historic buildings and has been a leader in historic preservation for over 100 years. The standards were developed in 1975 and updated in 1992.<ref>Jacobs, David E.. ''Guidelines for the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards in housing''.

It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:\n* '''Preservation''' \"places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair.\" All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.\n* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.\n* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period.

The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Intro|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for Restoration|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113212/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|archivedate=2011-10-10}} Updated 12/113/2013</ref>\n\nIn the United States restoration is different from preservation (conservation in UK) by allowing the removal of historic materials to create an accurate portrayal of a particular time period, not necessarily the original or final time periods.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Valletta Gro\u00dfmeisterpalast.JPG|thumb|The [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]], [[Malta]] being restored in 2011.]]\nIn the field of [[historic preservation]], building restoration is the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic building, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value. Restoration work may be performed to reverse decay, or alterations made to the building(s)\n\nSince Historic Building Conservation is more about fostering a deep appreciation for these famous structures and learning more about why they exist, rather than just keeping historic structures standing tall and looking as beautiful as ever, true historic building preservation aims for a high level of authenticity, accurately replicating historic materials and techniques as much as possible, ideally using modern techniques only in a concealed manner where they will not compromise the historic character of the structure's appearance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearlbaycorp.com/historicrestorations.html | title=Historic Building Restoration, Preservation, and Renovation | publisher=Pearl Bay Corporation | accessdate=28 May 2015 | author=Van Sanford, Scott}}</ref>\n\nFor instance a restoration might involve the replacement of outdated heating and cooling systems with newer ones, or the installation of climate controls that never existed at the time of building after careful study. [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the complex of former royal palaces outside [[St Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] is an example of this sort of work.\n\nExterior and interior paint colors present similar problems over time. Air pollution, acid rain, and sun take a toll, and often many layers of different paint exist. [[Historic paint analysis]] of old paint layers now allow a corresponding chemical recipe and color to be re-produced. But this is often only a beginning as many of the original materials are either unstable or in many cases environmentally unsound. Many eighteenth century greens were made with arsenic and lead, materials no longer allowed in paints. Another problem occurs when the original pigment came from a material no longer available. For example, in the early to mid-19th century, some browns were produced from bits of ground [[mummy|mummies]]. In cases like this the standards allow other materials with similar appearance to be used and organizations like Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] will work with a historic paint color re-creator s to replicate the antique paints in durable, stable, and environmentally safe materials. In the United States the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] is a helpful resource. The [[polychrome]] painted interiors of the [[Vermont State House]] and [[Boston Public Library]] are examples of this type of heritage restoration.\n\n==Secretary of Interiors standards for restoration==\n[[File:Nice brickwork - geograph.org.uk - 1034247.jpg|thumb|Not a good example of restoration, a glaringly different material of bricks in a stone wall.

It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:\n* '''Preservation''' \"places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair.\" All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.\n* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.\n* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.\n* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.\n\nThe first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration.

The film follows Green as a 28-year-old [[slacker]] who wishes to become a professional cartoonist. The film's plot resembles Green's struggles as a young man trying to get his TV series picked up, which would later become the popular [[MTV]] show ''[[The Tom Green Show]]''.\n\nReleased on April 20, 2001 by [[20th Century Fox]], the film was critically panned at the time of its release, with many considering it as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films of all time]]. It won five [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s of its [[22nd Golden Raspberry Awards|eight nominations]], as well as a [[Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association]] Award for Worst Picture. The film has met with more positive assessments over time, most notably from [[Metacritic]], [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)#IFC.com|IFC.com]], and [[The Awl|Splitsider]], with some commentators interpreting satirical and metahumorous themes within the film's gross-out gags.\n\n==Plot==\nUnemployed 28-year-old [[cartoonist]] Gordon \"Gord\" Brody leaves his parents' home in [[Portland, Oregon]], to pursue his lifelong ambition of obtaining a contract for an animated television series. His parents, Jim and Julie, give him a car in which he drives to [[Los Angeles]] and starts work at a cheese sandwich factory. Gord shows his drawings to Dave Davidson, the CEO of a major animation studio; Davidson commends the artwork but calls the concepts depicted, including a vigilante \"X-Ray Cat\", nonsensical. Disheartened, Gord quits his job and returns to his parents.\n\nJim constantly insults and belittles Gord following his return, telling him to forget about being an animator and \"get a job\". When Gord pressures his friend Darren into skating on a wooden half-pipe he has built outside the Brody home, Darren falls and breaks his leg. At the hospital, Gord impersonates a doctor, delivers a baby, and meets an attractive nurse named Betty, who uses a wheelchair, has an obsessive penchant for [[fellatio]], and wants to create a rocket-powered wheelchair. Gord lies to Jim that he has got a job in the computer industry and goes out to a restaurant with Betty, pretending he is at work. However, Jim sees him there and disparages Betty due to her disabilities. After a fight in the restaurant, Gord is arrested and Betty bails him out. Following her advice, Gord attempts to continue drawing; however, he gets into an argument with Jim, who then smashes Gord's half-pipe. Gord and his parents then go to a family therapy session, where Gord falsely accuses Jim of \"[[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]\" Gord's younger brother, Freddy. The 25-year-old Freddy is sent to a home for sexually molested children while Julie, being fed up with his abusive behavior and short temper, leaves Jim and ends up dating the basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. While in a drunken stupor, Jim tells Gord how much of a disappointment he is to him. Affected by Jim's words, Gord decides to abandon his aspirations to be a cartoonist and gets a job at a local sandwich shop.\n\nAfter seeing a television news report on Betty's successful rocket-powered wheelchair, Gord is inspired to pursue his dreams once again. He returns to Hollywood with a concept based on his relationship with his father: an animated series called ''Zebras in America''. Jim follows him there after threatening Darren into revealing where he had gone. While Gord is pitching the show to Davidson, Jim bursts in and trashes Davidson's office. Thinking Jim's actions are part of Gord's pitch, Davidson greenlights ''Zebras in America'' and gives Gord a million-dollar check. Gord spends a tenth of that money on an elaborate thank you to Betty for inspiring him, and the remainder to relocate the Brody house to [[Pakistan]] with his father inside, unconscious\u2014a response to Jim's earlier put-down that \"If this were Pakistan, you would have been sewing soccer balls when you were four years old!\"\n\nGord and Jim soon come to terms but are then abducted and held hostage. The kidnapping becomes a news item, as Gord's series has already become popular.

The film follows Green as a 28-year-old [[slacker]] who wishes to become a professional cartoonist. The film's plot resembles Green's struggles as a young man trying to get his TV series picked up, which would later become the popular [[MTV]] show ''[[The Tom Green Show]]''.\n\nReleased on April 20, 2001 by [[20th Century Fox]], the film was critically panned at the time of its release, with many considering it as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films of all time]]. It won five [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s of its [[22nd Golden Raspberry Awards|eight nominations]], as well as a [[Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association]] Award for Worst Picture. The film has met with more positive assessments over time, most notably from [[Metacritic]], [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)#IFC.com|IFC.com]], and [[The Awl|Splitsider]], with some commentators interpreting satirical and metahumorous themes within the film's gross-out gags.\n\n==Plot==\nUnemployed 28-year-old [[cartoonist]] Gordon \"Gord\" Brody leaves his parents' home in [[Portland, Oregon]], to pursue his lifelong ambition of obtaining a contract for an animated television series. His parents, Jim and Julie, give him a car in which he drives to [[Los Angeles]] and starts work at a cheese sandwich factory. Gord shows his drawings to Dave Davidson, the CEO of a major animation studio; Davidson commends the artwork but calls the concepts depicted, including a vigilante \"X-Ray Cat\", nonsensical. Disheartened, Gord quits his job and returns to his parents.\n\nJim constantly insults and belittles Gord following his return, telling him to forget about being an animator and \"get a job\". When Gord pressures his friend Darren into skating on a wooden half-pipe he has built outside the Brody home, Darren falls and breaks his leg. At the hospital, Gord impersonates a doctor, delivers a baby, and meets an attractive nurse named Betty, who uses a wheelchair, has an obsessive penchant for [[fellatio]], and wants to create a rocket-powered wheelchair. Gord lies to Jim that he has got a job in the computer industry and goes out to a restaurant with Betty, pretending he is at work. However, Jim sees him there and disparages Betty due to her disabilities. After a fight in the restaurant, Gord is arrested and Betty bails him out. Following her advice, Gord attempts to continue drawing; however, he gets into an argument with Jim, who then smashes Gord's half-pipe. Gord and his parents then go to a family therapy session, where Gord falsely accuses Jim of \"[[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]\" Gord's younger brother, Freddy. The 25-year-old Freddy is sent to a home for sexually molested children while Julie, being fed up with his abusive behavior and short temper, leaves Jim and ends up dating the basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. While in a drunken stupor, Jim tells Gord how much of a disappointment he is to him. Affected by Jim's words, Gord decides to abandon his aspirations to be a cartoonist and gets a job at a local sandwich shop.\n\nAfter seeing a television news report on Betty's successful rocket-powered wheelchair, Gord is inspired to pursue his dreams once again. He returns to Hollywood with a concept based on his relationship with his father: an animated series called ''Zebras in America''. Jim follows him there after threatening Darren into revealing where he had gone. While Gord is pitching the show to Davidson, Jim bursts in and trashes Davidson's office. Thinking Jim's actions are part of Gord's pitch, Davidson greenlights ''Zebras in America'' and gives Gord a million-dollar check. Gord spends a tenth of that money on an elaborate thank you to Betty for inspiring him, and the remainder to relocate the Brody house to [[Pakistan]] with his father inside, unconscious \u2014 a response to Jim's earlier put-down that \"If this were Pakistan, you would have been sewing soccer balls when you were four years old!\"\n\nGord and Jim soon come to terms but are then abducted and held hostage. The kidnapping becomes a news item, as Gord's series has already become popular. After 18 months in captivity, Gord and Jim return to America, where a huge crowd, including Betty and Darren, welcomes them home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Green]] as Gordon Brody, a 28-year old [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] unemployed cartoonist who dreams of having his own cartoon show.\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Jim Brody, Gord's verbally and emotionally abusive father who was falsely accused by Gord of [[Rape|sexually abusing]] [[Incest|Freddy]] by [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] him.\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Betty Menger, Gord's [[Autosadism|auto-sadistic]] wheelchair-bound girlfriend who has a heavy obsession with fellatio.\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Freddy Brody, Gord's younger brother who was sent to an institute for sexually abused children after Gord lies about Jim fingering Freddy.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Darren, Gord's friend who gets injured on Gord's skateboard ramp.\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Dave Davidson, the head of Radioactive animation studios who picks up Gord's cartoons for an animated series.\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Julie Brody, Gord's mother.\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Davidson's receptionist\n* [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as himself\n*Jackson Davies as Mr. Malloy, the Brody's next-door neighbor.\n* [[Connor Widdows]] as Andy Malloy, the son of Mr. Malloy and is the center of a running gag where he is constantly suffering brutal facial injuries whenever he appears in a scene.\n* [[Lorena Gale]] as Psychiatrist/Social worker\n* [[Noel Fisher]] as Pimply manager\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] (''uncredited'') as Uncle Neil\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nThe theatrical release is 87 minutes and received an [[MPAA film rating system|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] following requested cuts to tone it down from an [[NC-17]], a rating which Green described as \"like porn with murder.\" As an extra on the [[DVD]] release, Green also included a version of the ending, where a small child character gets sliced by the airplane propeller, which he had edited to secure a [[MPAA film rating system|PG rating]].

The battle occurred between 15 and 23 October 1944. It occurred in and around the region of [[Vukov Klanac]] as Wehrmacht forces retreated from the nearby cities of [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Ston]]. It resulted in the  [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Devil's Division]] losing most of its equipment and a large fraction of its manpower to Partisan forces.\n\n==Prelude==\nThe grounds of the battle took place south of the [[Neretva#Lower Neretva and wetlands|Lower Neretva Valley]] between the majority of the [[Wehrmacht]] [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th \"Devil's Division\"]] and elements of the  [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Shock Corps]], mainly the 1st and 11th Brigades of the [[26th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|26th Division]]. Prior to the battle the 369th was withdrawing from [[Dubrovnik]] following significant land gains from Dalmatian partisans. The Supreme Staff ordered the 26th Division to liberate [[Pelje\u0161ac]] and to prevent the 369th division from retreating to [[Metkovi\u0107]] on the Neretva River. On 13 October, at the 26th Division's headquarters post in [[Janjina]], Colonel [[Bo\u017eo Bo\u017eovi\u0107]], with his commissar [[Du\u0161an Kora\u010d]] and chief of staff [[Ante Bio\u010di\u0107]] met with the commanders of the 1st and 11th Brigades to form a plan to liberate [[Ston]] and cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nThe 1st Brigade had to cross the [[Bay of Mali Ston]] and land near [[Neum]], where it would infiltrate the Vukov Gorge area, cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road, and prevent enemy counterattacks from Metkovi\u0107. The 11th Brigade was ordered to liberate Ston and then to assist the 1st Brigade in cutting off and defeating the Wehrmacht and Usta\u0161e forces in withdrawing from Dubrovnik.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n===Neum===\nBefore Ston could be taken, there were multiple tactically prominent locations that the Partisans needed to take. The 1st Brigade was divided into four battalions, with three crossing the Bay of Mali Ston and the fourth being held in reserve. The first and third landed near the village of [[Klek, Croatia|Klek]], while the second landed across the channel on the [[Klek (peninsula)|Klek Peninsula]]. The two battalions that landed near the village of Klek engaged the overstretched third battalion of the German 370th Regiment and quickly took control over surrounding villages along the coast. The battalion on the Klek peninsula advanced east towards the Neum-Ston road and took a crossroads about a kilometer south of Neum.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\nThe following morning of 16 October, the German garrison in Neum was ordered to withdraw westward to the towns of Du\u017ei, Topola, and O\u0161lje. With the liquidation of the defense at Neum, elements of the 1st Brigade quickly occupied the important harbor of the town. From there, the third battalion was ordered to take the German stronghold of Kuti and deny the road to Metkovi\u0107. By the end of the day, a large swath of coast stretching from Neum to Klek and Slivno Ravno was under Partisan control, and the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road link was severed.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n===Entry into Vukov Gorge===\nThe 1st Brigade was then tasked with breaking into the area of Vukov Gorge and taking the peak of [[O\u0161trikovac]]. Taking the mountain was important because the peak overlooked the crossroads of the road from Dubrovnik and the road from Ston. Over the day of 17 October, the 1st Brigade went on the attack and made significant gains across the Vukov Gorge area. The first battalion took Du\u017ei and was cycled into reserve, but not before it could sever the connection between Hutovo and Du\u017ei, trapping yet more German garrisons. Just North of Hutovo, the 13th Brigade, part of the [[29th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|29th Herzegovinian Division]], held position in Popovo Polje and was yet to make contact with the command of the 26th Division. By the end of the day of 17 October, the 2nd and 4th battalions had occupied [[Topola, Croatia|Topola]] and [[O\u0161lje]], within striking distance of O\u0161trikovac. During this time the 3rd battalion broke the German garrison at Kuti and took over prepared German demolition points. The German reaction out of Metkovi\u0107 was harsh. The Germans attacked the Partisans around the village of Kuti three times following the Partisans capturing the village. The 1st Brigade now held the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road from the outskirts of Metkovi\u0107 all the way to O\u0161trikovac.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=127}}\n\n===Ston===\nThe 11th Brigade's attack on the town of Ston was supported by a British long-range artillery unit on [[Mljet]].{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=125}} On 18 October, following the gains made by the 1st Brigade, the 11th Brigade commenced its attack on Ston. Prior to the 18 October the brigade had made minor attacks on bunkers and strongpoints around Ston but had failed to produce any major results. The Germans in the meantime had been reinforced by a company of quisling Italian fascists. On the 18th, however, following a concentrated attack from the 11th Brigade the Italians and Germans were forced to retreat from [[Mali Ston]] into Ston proper. Following the capture of Mali Ston, the partisans moved into an attack on the city of Ston, where resistance was stronger, helped by the intact medieval fortifications in Ston. German strongpoints in the forts of Ka\u0161tio and Korona were surrounded and held out for a few hours before Partisans overran the fortifications. By the evening of 18 October, Ston was completely under Partisan control.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=127}} The remaining German forces retreated past Rudine and Doli to reinforce O\u0161trikovac, which was being attacked by Partisans in the surrounding shrubland. 258 Germans and Italians surrendered to the Partisans at Ston.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\n===O\u0161trikovac===\n[[File:Vukov klanac destroyed german tank.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav Partisans standing beside a destroyed German tank at Vukov Gorge, October 1944]]\nAs the 11th Brigade pressed the Germans at Ston, the Partisans in the area around O\u0161trikovac attacked the German stronghold on the mountain to prevent a successful German withdrawal from Ston. The 2nd and 4th battalions of the 1st Brigade attacked the stronghold around the same time the 11th Brigade attacked Ston. The German defenders had been reinforced by troops withdrawing from Dubrovnik. The attack continued inconclusively throughout the day of 18 October, with no significant gains made by the Partisans, even when the Partisans deployed the 1st Battalion to reinforce the attackers. The command of the 1st Brigade cancelled the attack that night to reorganize.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nThe next morning the attack resumed. At this same time, the German presence in the Vukov Gorge area was reorganized into Army Group \"Becker\", around 4,000 strong. A reinforced garrison at Metkovi\u0107 began to move towards Partisan-occupied demolition points North of Vukov Gorge. Learning of an armored German advance from Metkovi\u0107, the Partisans used the demolition points to turn back the German advance. The command of the 26th Division, expecting a counterattack from the Germans at O\u0161trikovac as well, ordered the 1st Brigade to withdraw to the flanks of the O\u0161trikovac-Vukov Gorge road and prepared to ambush any advancing German forces. At the same time the 11th Brigade positioned along the Metkovi\u0107-Dubrovnik road to ambush the retreating column from Metkovi\u0107 that had been stopped earlier that day.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nThe command of the 26th Division, worried about the uncertainty of the situation in Vukov Gorge and eager to secure its gains (Neum and Ston) earlier that week, had actually ordered the 1st Brigade to withdraw back to Pelje\u0161ac and the 11th to Neum. However, conditions of heavy combat prevented either Brigade from being able to withdraw. The command of the entire [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Corps]] shared the same concerns as the command of the 26th Division and ordered the 1st and 11th to withdraw from its situation by 22 October to be redeployed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Bra\u010d]].{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\n===Vukov Klanac===\nThe order to withdraw came in a difficult situation for the brigades as they were tied down in brutal engagements with Army Group Becker, which was attempting to break through to Metkovi\u0107. This meant that neither brigade was able to withdraw at the time. On 20 October following the instructions of the 8th Corps, the command of the 26th Division sent a request to the 29th Division in Dubrovnik asking that Herzegovinian brigades replace the exhausted 1st and 11th brigades. This exchange was unable to occur as the headquarters of the 29th Division was too far to redeploy in time. Ante Bio\u010di\u0107, Chief of Staff for the 26th division, disobeyed orders and refused to compel the division to retreat from its positions. The 11th Brigade went ahead with the direct orders of the 8th Corps and retreated to Mali Ston anyways, without Bio\u010di\u0107's knowledge or permission.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nWith the absence of the 11th Brigade, the Northern flank of the Partisan salient around Vukov Gorge was left overstretched, only manned by the Brigade's 4th battalion. In the early morning of 21 October both Army Group Becker and the German garrison in Metkovi\u0107 attacked the 1st Brigade. After an intense encounter with the garrison from Metkovi\u0107, the 4th battalion was able to temporarily halt its advance. However, the commander of the 1st Brigade, [[Bogdan Stupar]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=165}}, wanted to minimize the risk of the 4th battalion being badly damaged and ordered it out of the Metkovi\u0107 area, instead having it test the German defenses at [[Opuzen]]. Throughout the rest of the day the other three battalions in the 1st Brigade battered the advancing column of Army Group Becker along the road to Vukov Gorge. By the end of the day the Metkovi\u0107 force and Becker had met at Vukov Gorge, where the road had been demolished by Partisans. With the vehicles of Army Group Becker unable to cross the road, the force made the fatal decision to hold at Vukov Gorge.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\nThe commander of Army Group Becker could have in theory continued towards Metkovi\u0107 without his heavy equipment, but he was convinced that it was not worth losing so much armor and motorized war materiel. So it was that over the night of 21/22 October the entire force of Becker was left completely exposed to the war-seasoned Partisans' guerrilla tactics and suffered heavy casualties. Wounded had to be carried by stretcher across the long, exposed stretch of destroyed road to be evacuated to Metkovi\u0107. Engineers arrived the next day, 22 October, and the commander of the German force was told it would take a minimum of two weeks to repair the road. The force of Army Group Becker, now surrounded, held out for another night, under constant attack from Partisans of the 1st Brigade. At dawn on 23 October, Army Group Becker capitulated. Only a quarter of the German force managed to escape back to Metkovi\u0107. At the scene of the battle remained all German machinery and equipment, destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn October 23, Chief of Staff of the 26th Division, Ante Bio\u010dic reported to the Division Headquarters: \"Bitter battles were fought with the enemy who sought to break through from O\u0161trikovac to Metkovi\u0107. Even the smallest remnants would probably have been destroyed had the 11th Brigade not been pulled out for a new task during the battle.\" The total losses of the enemy in the area of Ston-Vukov Gorge, according to the report of the 26th Division Headquarters of November 17, 1944, delivered to the 8th Corps Headquarters, amounted to 2,000 dead and 1,070 captured German soldiers and officers. 12 tanks and 20 trucks were destroyed. 211 motor vehicles were seized, one intact tank, 60 various cannons, 289 horses and various other equipment was taken. The 1st and 11th Dalmatian Brigade units had 56 dead and about 260 wounded.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n===Books===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ani\u0107 |first= Nikola |title= Povijest Osmog korpusa narodnooslobodila\u010dke vojske Hrvatske 1943-1945 |language= Croatian |trans-title= History of the Eighth Corps of the People's Liberation Army of Croatia 1943-1945 |date=2004 |access-date=30 March 2020 |url=http://www.znaci.net/00003/498.htm}}\n* {{cite book |last= Mitcham |first= Samuel W. |date=2007 |title=German Order of Battle: Volume Two |isbn=978-0-8117-3416-5}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n[[Category:Yugoslavia in World War II]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Yugoslav Partisans]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict = Battle of Vukov Klanac\n| image = Vukov klanac partisan mortar.png\n| caption = [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] operating a mortar in Vukov Gorge\n| place = Between [[Ston]] and [[Metkovi\u0107]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=125}}, [[Independent State of Croatia]]\n| date = 15-23 October 1944\n| result =  [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] victory\n| combatant1 = {{flagicon | Yugoslavia}} [[Yugoslav Partisans]]\n| combatant2 = {{flag | NDH}}<br>{{flagicon | NDH}} [[Usta\u0161e]]\n| units2 = {{flagicon | Nazi Germany | variant=army}}  [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Division]]\n* 369th Regiment\n* 370th Regiment\n{{flagicon | NDH}}  [[9th Brigade (Usta\u0161e Militia)|9th Brigade]]\n| units1 = {{flagicon | Yugoslavia}}  [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Shock Corps]]\n* {{flagicon | SR Croatia}}  [[26th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|26th Division]]\n** 1st Brigade\n** 11th Brigade\n{{flagicon | SR Bosnia and Herzegovina}}  [[29th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|29th Division]] {{resize|(briefly)}}\n| commander1 = [[Bo\u017eo Bo\u017eovi\u0107]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=165}}<br>[[Vlado \u0160egrt]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=225}}\n| commander2 = {{flagicon | Nazi Germany}} [[Georg Reinicke]]{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|page=74}}\n| casualties1 = 56 dead<br>260 wounded\n| casualties2 = 2,000 dead{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=125}}{{efn|Yugoslav sources from the 26th Division}}<br>1,070 captured\n| strength1 = 3,000\n| strength2 = {{flagicon|Nazi Germany|variant=army}} 8,000<br>{{flagicon|NDH|variant=army}} 720 militia\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Yugoslavia}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Vukov Klanac''', known in English as the '''Battle of Vukov Gorge''', was a 7-day fight between [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] forces in central [[Dalmatia]]. The battle occurred between 15 and 23 October 1944. It occurred in and around the region of [[Vukov Klanac]] as Wehrmacht forces retreated from the nearby cities of [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Ston]]. It resulted in the  [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th Devil's Division]] losing most of its equipment and a large fraction of its manpower to Partisan forces.\n\n==Prelude==\nThe grounds of the battle took place south of the [[Neretva#Lower Neretva and wetlands|Lower Neretva Valley]] between the majority of the [[Wehrmacht]] [[369th (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|369th \"Devil's Division\"]] and elements of the  [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Shock Corps]], mainly the 1st and 11th Brigades of the [[26th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|26th Division]]. Prior to the battle the 369th was withdrawing from [[Dubrovnik]] following significant land gains from Dalmatian partisans. The Supreme Staff ordered the 26th Division to liberate [[Pelje\u0161ac]] and to prevent the 369th division from retreating to [[Metkovi\u0107]] on the Neretva River. On 13 October, at the 26th Division's headquarters post in [[Janjina]], Colonel [[Bo\u017eo Bo\u017eovi\u0107]], with his commissar [[Du\u0161an Kora\u010d]] and chief of staff [[Ante Bio\u010di\u0107]] met with the commanders of the 1st and 11th Brigades to form a plan to liberate [[Ston]] and cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=126}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nThe 1st Brigade had to cross the [[Bay of Mali Ston]] and land near [[Neum]], where it would infiltrate the Vukov Gorge area, cut off the Dubrovnik-Metkovi\u0107 road, and prevent enemy counterattacks from Metkovi\u0107.

The command of the entire [[8th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Corps]] shared the same concerns as the command of the 26th Division and ordered the 1st and 11th to withdraw from its situation by 22 October to be redeployed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Bra\u010d]].{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\n===Vukov Klanac===\nThe order to withdraw came in a difficult situation for the brigades as they were tied down in brutal engagements with Army Group Becker, which was attempting to break through to Metkovi\u0107. This meant that neither brigade was able to withdraw at the time. On the 20th of October following the instructions of the 8th Corps, the command of the 26th Division sent a request to the 29th Division in Dubrovnik asking that Herzegovinian brigades replace the exhausted 1st and 11th brigades. This exchange was unable to occur as the headquarters of the 29th Division was too far to redeploy in time. Ante Bio\u010di\u0107, Chief of Staff for the 26th division, disobeyed orders and refused to compel the division to retreat from its positions. The 11th Brigade went ahead with the direct orders of the 8th Corps and retreated to Mali Ston anyways, without Bio\u010di\u0107's knowledge or permission.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=128}}\n\nWith the absence of the 11th Brigade, the Northern flank of the Partisan salient around Vukov Gorge was left overstretched, only manned by the Brigade's 4th battalion. In the early morning of 21 October both Army Group Becker and the German garrison in Metkovi\u0107 attacked the 1st Brigade. After an intense encounter with the garrison from Metkovi\u0107, the 4th battalion was able to temporarily halt its advance. However, the commander of the 1st Brigade, [[Bogdan Stupar]]{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=165}}, wanted to minimize the risk of the 4th battalion being badly damaged and ordered it out of the Metkovi\u0107 area, instead having it test the German defenses at [[Opuzen]]. Throughout the rest of the day the other three battalions in the 1st Brigade battered the the advancing column of Army Group Becker along the road to Vukov Gorge. By the end of the day the Metkovi\u0107 force and Becker had met at Vukov Gorge, where the road had been demolished by Partisans. With the vehicles of Army Group Becker unable to cross the road, the force made the fatal decision to hold at Vukov Gorge.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\nThe commander of Army Group Becker could have in theory continued towards Metkovi\u0107 without his heavy equipment, but he was convinced that it was not worth losing so much armor and motorized war materiel. So it was that over the night of 21/22 October the entire force of Becker was left completely exposed to the war-seasoned Partisans' guerrilla tactics and suffered heavy casualties. Wounded had to be carried by stretcher across the long, exposed stretch of destroyed road to be evacuated to Metkovi\u0107. Engineers arrived the next day, 22 October, and the commander of the German force was told it would take a minimum of two weeks to repair the road. The force of Army Group Becker, now surrounded, held out for another night, under constant attack from Partisans of the 1st Brigade. At dawn on 23 October, Army Group Becker capitulated. Only a quarter of the German force managed to escape back to Metkovi\u0107. At the scene of the battle remained all German machinery and equipment, destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn October 23, Chief of Staff of the 26th Division, Ante Bio\u010dic reported to the Division Headquarters: \"Bitter battles were fought with the enemy who sought to break through from O\u0161trikovac to Metkovi\u0107. Even the smallest remnants would probably have been destroyed had the 11th Brigade not been pulled out for a new task during the battle.\" The total losses of the enemy in the area of Ston-Vukov Gorge, according to the report of the 26th Division Headquarters of November 17, 1944, delivered to the 8th Corps Headquarters, amounted to 2,000 dead and 1,070 captured German soldiers and officers. 12 tanks and 20 trucks were destroyed. 211 motor vehicles were seized, one intact tank, 60 various cannons, 289 horses and various other equipment was taken. The 1st and 11th Dalmatian Brigade units had 56 dead and about 260 wounded.{{sfn|Ani\u0107|2004|page=129}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n===Books===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ani\u0107 |first= Nikola |title= Povijest Osmog korpusa narodnooslobodila\u010dke vojske Hrvatske 1943-1945 |language= Croatian |trans-title= History of the Eighth Corps of the People's Liberation Army of Croatia 1943-1945 |date=2004 |access-date=30 March 2020 |url=http://www.znaci.net/00003/498.htm}}\n* {{cite book |last= Mitcham |first= Samuel W. |date=2007 |title=German Order of Battle: Volume Two |isbn=978-0-8117-3416-5}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n[[Category:Yugoslavia in World War II]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Yugoslav Partisans]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed +", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vukov_Klanac"}
