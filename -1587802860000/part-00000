The committee consisted of ten distinguished physicists:- [[William Henry Bragg|W.H. Bragg]], M. Brillouin, [[Orso Mario Corbino|O.M. Corbino]], M. Knudsen, M. Leblanc, [[Robert Andrews Millikan|R.A. Millikan]], H. Nagaoka, E. Van Aubel, and H. Abraham. The committee had Bragg as President, Van Aubel as Vice-President, and Abraham as Secretary.\n\nThis was the birth of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.\n\n== Committees and governance ==\nThe Union is governed by its General Assembly, which meets every three years. The Council is its top executive body, supervising the activities of the nineteen specialized International Commissions and the four Affiliated Commissions \u2013 it typically meets once or twice per year. The Union is composed of Members representing identified physics communities. At present 60 Members adhere to IUPAP. The Members are represented by Liaison Committees.  Members of the Council and Commissions are elected by the General Assembly, based on nominations received from Liaison Committees and existing Council and Commission members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iupap.org/about-us/statutes/ |\ntitle=The Statues of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (as adopted by the General Assembly, 2011)|date=2011 |publisher=IUPAP |access-date=2019-03-26 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n'''The IUPAP specialised Commissions are:'''\n\nC1.

[https://iupap.org/commissions/affiliated-commissions/ac4-international-commission-on-medical-physics/ International Commission on Medical Physics]\n\nIn addition IUPAP has established a number of Working Groups to provide an overview of important areas of international collaboration in physics.\n\n== Sponsored conferences ==\nEach year, IUPAP endorses approximately 30 international conferences and awards grants to the majority of them. Applications for sponsorship can be made via the IUPAP website.\n\nSponsored conferences fall into four categories:\n\n'''General Conferences - Type A'''\n\nThese provide a broad overview of an entire field (typically the field of interest to a Commission), and normally occur at two- or three-year intervals, as advances in the field warrant. Attendance in the range of 750-1000 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Topical Conferences - Type B'''\n\nThese concentrate on broad sub-fields (e.g. nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear reaction mechanisms, heavy ion physics, are possible sub-fields in the field of Nuclear Physics). They would normally be scheduled in the years between the corresponding Type A General conferences. Attendance in the range of 300-600 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Special Conferences - Type C'''\n\nThese concentrate on much more specialised topics than in the case of Type B Conferences (e.g. angular correlations, lifetime measurements, neutron resonance studies in the field of Nuclear Physics). Attendance in the range of 50-200 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Workshops in Developing Countries - Type D'''\n\nThese concentrate on meeting the needs of a developing region. Unlike the Type A, B and C conferences, they do not need to be truly international, but should involve neighbouring countries, and they should address the needs of the region. One Type D conference will be approved each year. All applications for Type-D Conferences must be submitted to the Commission on Physics for Development (C13).\n\n== Sponsored awards ==\nIUPAP commissions sponsor various awards for scientists. These include:\n\n* The IUPAP Young Scientist Prize, approved and adopted at the 2005 General Assembly for all commissions.\n* The SUNAMCO Medal, given by the Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses and Fundamental Constants (C2) \n* The Boltzmann Medal, awarded by the Commission on Statistical Physics (C3) \n* The Fritz London Award, given by the Commission on Low Temperature Physics (C5)  \n* The Young Author Best Paper Award, established by the Commission on Semiconductors (C8) and sponsored by the semiconductor industries of USA, Japan and Europe \n* ICM Award in Magnetism, established by the Commission on Magnetism (C9) \n* The ICPE Medal, sponsored by the Commission on Physics Education (C14) \n* Penning Award Excellence in Low-Temperature Plasma Physics, established by the Commission on Plasma Physics (C16)\n* ICO Prize, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)  \n* ICO Galileo Galilei Award, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)\n\n== Sponsored symposiums==\n* [[Symposium on Laser Physics]]\n\n== Member States of IUPAP ==\n\nIUPAP was founded  by 13 states:- Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Empire of Japan, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States and Union of South Africa in 1922. Since then many new members have joined the union.Today the IUPAP consists of 56 member states.\n\nBelow is the list of Member States of IUPAP:- \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"8\" |List of the Current and Former  Member States of IUPAP<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iupap.org/about-us/history-of-membership/|title=History of Membership {{!}} IUPAP: The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|website=iupap.org|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n!Country\n!Shares\n\n(2015)\n!Votes\n\n(2015)\n!Year of\nJoining\n!Year of\nceasing to \n\nbe a member\n!Rejoining\n(1)\n!Rejoining\n(2)\n|-\n|1\n|{{flag|Algeria}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n|{{flag|Argentina}}\n|1\n|1\n|1951\n|\n|1984\n|\n|-\n|3\n|{{flag|Australia}}\n|4\n|3\n|1925\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n|{{flag|Austria}}\n|2\n|2\n|1957\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n|{{flag|Belgium}}\n|4\n|3\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n|{{flag|Brazil}}\n|8\n|4\n|1951\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n|{{flag|Canada}}\n|8\n|4\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n|{{flag|Chile}}\n|1\n|1\n|1984\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n|{{flag|CHN|name=China-Beijing}} (PRC)\n|15\n|5\n|1984\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|10\n|{{flag|TWN|name=China-Taipei}} (Taiwan)\n|5\n|3\n|1984\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|11\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|12\n|{{flag|Croatia}}\n|1\n|1\n|1993\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|13\n|{{flag|Cyprus}}\n|1\n|1\n|2003\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|14\n|{{flag|Czech Republic}}\n|4\n|3\n|1993\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|15\n|{{flag|Denmark}}\n|3\n|2\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|16\n|{{flag|Estonia}}\n|1\n|1\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|17\n|{{flag|Ethiopia}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|No Voting rights<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iupap.org/about-us/history-of-membership/|title=History of Membership {{!}} IUPAP: The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|website=iupap.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n|\n|\n|-\n|18\n|{{flag|Finland}}\n|3\n|2\n|1947\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|19\n|{{flag|France}}\n|15\n|5\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|20\n|{{flag|Germany}}\n|15\n|5\n|1954\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|21\n|{{flag|Ghana}}\n|1\n|1\n|?\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|22\n|{{flag|Greece}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|23\n|{{flag|Hungary}}\n|3\n|2\n|1948\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|24\n|{{flag|India}}\n|8\n|4\n|1948\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|25\n|{{flag|Iran}}\n|1\n|1\n|?\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|26\n|{{flag|Ireland}}\n|1\n|1\n|1966\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|27\n|{{flag|Israel}}\n|2\n|2\n|1951\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|28\n|{{flag|Italy}}\n|12\n|5\n|1923\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|29\n|{{flag|Japan}}\n|15\n|5\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|30\n|{{flag|Jordan}}\n|2\n|1\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|31\n|{{flag|KOR|name=Korea}} (ROK)\n|10\n|5\n|1969\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|32\n|{{flag|Latvia}}\n|1\n|1\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|33\n|{{flag|Lithuania}}\n|1\n|1\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|34\n|{{flag|Mexico}}\n|2\n|2\n|1925\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|35\n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n|4\n|3\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|36\n|{{flag|New Zealand}}\n|1\n|1\n|1954\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|37\n|{{flag|Norway}}\n|3\n|2\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|38\n|{{flag|Pakistan}}\n|0\n|0\n|1951\n|\n|2017\n|\n|-\n|39\n|{{flag|Peru}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|40\n|{{PHL}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|41\n|{{flag|Poland}}\n|4\n|3\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|42\n|{{flag|Portugal}}\n|1\n|1\n|1984\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|43\n|{{flag|Romania}}\n|1\n|1\n|1947\n|\n|1960-87\n|2009\n|-\n|44\n|{{flag|Russia}}\n|18\n|6\n|1957\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|45\n|{{flag|Saudi Arabia}}\n|1\n|1\n|1990\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|46\n|{{flag|Senegal}}\n|1\n|1\n|?\n|No voting rights\n|\n|\n|-\n|47\n|{{flag|Singapore}}\n|2\n|2\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|48\n|{{SVK}}\n|1\n|1\n|1993\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|49\n|{{flag|Slovenia}}\n|1\n|1\n|1993\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|50\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n|3\n|2\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|51\n|{{flag|Spain}}\n|8\n|4\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|52\n|{{flag|Sweden}}\n|8\n|4\n|1923\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|53\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n|4\n|3\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|54\n|{{flag|Tunisia}}\n|1\n|1\n|2005\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|55\n|{{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|15\n|5\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|56\n|{{flag|United States}}\n|18\n|6\n|1922\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Bolivia}}\n|0\n|0\n|1963\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Bulgaria}}\n|0\n|0\n|1957\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Cameroon}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|2017\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Colombia}}\n|1\n|1\n|2009\n|2017\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Cuba}}\n|1\n|1\n|1969\n|No voting rights\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Egypt}}\n|1\n|1\n|1948\n|2017\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|East Germany}}\n|\n|\n|1960\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Kenya}}\n|1\n|1\n|1995\n|2017\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Nigeria}}\n|0\n|0\n|1990\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{Flag|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|name=Republic of China}}\n<small>(membership renewed as China-Taipei)</small>\n|\n|\n|1934\n|1984\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Soviet Union}}\n<small>(succeeded by Russia)</small>\n|18\n|6\n|1957\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|{{flag|Yugoslavia}}\n|0\n|0\n|1954\n|1992\n|\n|\n|}\n\n== List of IUPAP Presidents ==\n\nThe IUPAP President is the head of the Executive Council.

The committee consisted of ten distinguished physicists:- [[William Henry Bragg|W.H. Bragg]], M. Brillouin, [[Orso Mario Corbino|O.M. Corbino]], M. Knudsen, M. Leblanc, [[Robert Andrews Millikan|R.A. Millikan]], H. Nagaoka, E. Van Aubel, and H. Abraham. The committee had Bragg as President, Van Aubel as Vice-President, and Abraham as Secretary.\n\nThis was the birth of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.\n\n== Committees and governance<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iupap.org/about-us/statutes/ |\ntitle=The Statues of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (as adopted by the General Assembly, 2011)|date=2011 |publisher=IUPAP |access-date=2019-03-26 |quote=}}</ref> ==\nThe Union is governed by its General Assembly, which meets every three years. The Council is its top executive body, supervising the activities of the nineteen specialized International Commissions and the four Affiliated Commissions \u2013 it typically meets once or twice per year. The Union is composed of Members representing identified physics communities. At present 60 Members adhere to IUPAP. The Members are represented by Liaison Committees.  Members of the Council and Commissions are elected by the General Assembly, based on nominations received from Liaison Committees and existing Council and Commission members. \n\n'''The IUPAP specialised Commissions are:'''\n\nC1.

Applications for sponsorship can be made via the IUPAP website.\n\nSponsored conferences fall into four categories:\n\n'''General Conferences - Type A'''\n\nThese provide a broad overview of an entire field (typically the field of interest to a Commission), and normally occur at two- or three-year intervals, as advances in the field warrant. Attendance in the range of 750-1000 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Topical Conferences - Type B'''\n\nThese concentrate on broad sub-fields (e.g. nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear reaction mechanisms, heavy ion physics, are possible sub-fields in the field of Nuclear Physics). They would normally be scheduled in the years between the corresponding Type A General conferences. Attendance in the range of 300-600 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Special Conferences - Type C'''\n\nThese concentrate on much more specialised topics than in the case of Type B Conferences (e.g. angular correlations, lifetime measurements, neutron resonance studies in the field of Nuclear Physics). Attendance in the range of 50-200 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Workshops in Developing Countries - Type D'''\n\nThese concentrate on meeting the needs of a developing region. Unlike the Type A, B and C conferences, they do not need to be truly international, but should involve neighbouring countries, and they should address the needs of the region. One Type D conference will be approved each year.

If the forest is replaced with only one species of tree and all other vegetation is prevented from growing back, a [[monoculture]] forest similar to agricultural crops would be the result. However, most reforestation involves the planting of different selections of seedlings taken from the area, often of multiple species.<ref name=\"kennethmarendefoundation.com\">{{cite web |url=http://kennethmarendefoundation.com/index.php/reforestation-problem |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111185724/http://kennethmarendefoundation.com/index.php/reforestation-problem |archivedate=2014-11-11 }} {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> Another important factor is the natural regeneration of a wide variety of plant and animal species that can occur on a [[clearcutting|clear cut]]. In some areas the suppression of [[wildfire|forest fires]] for hundreds of years has resulted in large single aged and single species [[stand level modelling|forest stands]]. The logging of small clear cuts and/or prescribed burning actually increases the biodiversity in these areas by creating a greater variety of tree stand ages and species.\n\n== For harvesting ==\n{{see also|Harvesting}}\nReforestation need not be only used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as [[Finland]], many of the forests are ''managed'' by the wood products and [[pulp and paper industry]]. In such an arrangement, like other crops, trees are planted to replace those that have been cut. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation. The wood products industry systematically replaces many of the trees it cuts, employing large numbers of summer workers for [[tree planting]] work. For example, in 2010, [[Weyerhaeuser]] reported planting 50 million seedlings.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Sustainable Forest Management  | work = Key Timberland Statistics  | publisher = Weyerhaeuser  | date = 10 June 2011  | url = http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Planet/SustainableForestManagement  | accessdate = 7 January 2012  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111229213132/http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/Sustainability/Planet/SustainableForestManagement  | archivedate = 29 December 2011  }}</ref> However replanting an [[old-growth forest]] with a [[plantation]] is [[Plantation#Natural forest loss|not replacing the old with the same]] characteristics in the new.\n\nIn just 20 years, a [[teak]] plantation in [[Costa Rica]] can produce up to about 400 m\u00b3 of wood per hectare.

Even without displacing [[agriculture]] and cities, earth can sustain almost one billion hectares of new forests. This would remove 25% of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere and reduce its concentration to levels that existed in the early twentieth century. A temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would reduce the area suitable for forests by 20% by the year 2050, because some tropical areas will become too hot.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The countries that have the most forest-ready land are: [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[United States]] and [[China]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe four major strategies are: increase the amount of forested land through reforestation; increase density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale; expand the use of forest products that sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions; and reduce carbon emissions caused by deforestation and degradation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\nImplementing the first strategy is supported by many organizations around the world. For example, in China, the [[Jane Goodall Institute]], through their Shanghai [[Roots & Shoots]] division, launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, [[Inner Mongolia]] to plant one million trees.<ref name=\"Shanghai Roots & Shoots\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jgi-shanghai.org|title=Shanghai Roots & Shoots -|work=jgi-shanghai.org|access-date=2019-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224030000/http://www.jgi-shanghai.org/|archive-date=2017-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"The Million Tree Project\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtpchina.org|title=Million Tree Project :: Home|work=mtpchina.org}}</ref> China used 2.4 billion hectares of new forest to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} In [[Java, Indonesia]] newlywed couples give whoever is conducting their wedding 5 seedlings.

In theory, planting any kind of tree to produce more forest cover would absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, a [[genetically modified]] variant might grow much faster than unmodified specimens.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | title = A changing climate of opinion? | journal = The Economist  | volume = 387 | issue =  | pages = 93\u201396 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.economist.com/help/DisplayHelp.cfm?folder=663377 | accessdate = 2010-08-29}}</ref>{{rp|93}} Some of these cultivars are under development. Such fast-growing trees would be planted for harvest and can absorb carbon dioxide faster than slower-growing trees.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nImpacts on temperature are affected by the location of the forest. For example, reforestation in boreal or [[subarctic]] regions has less impact on climate. This is because it substitutes a high-[[albedo]], snow-dominated region with a lower-albedo forest canopy. By contrast, tropical reforestation projects lead to a positive change such as the formation of [[clouds]]. These clouds then [[albedo|reflect the sunlight]], lowering temperatures.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1457}}\n\nPlanting trees in [[tropical climate]]s with [[wet season]]s has another advantage. In such a setting, trees grow more quickly (fixing more carbon) because they can grow year-round. Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the [[:wikt:girth|girth]] of 70,000 trees across [[Africa]] has shown that tropical forests fix more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggested almost one fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across [[Africa]], [[Amazonia]] and [[Asia]]. Simon Lewis stated, \"Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/18/trees-tropics-climate-change | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fifth of world carbon emissions soaked up by extra forest growth, scientists find | first=David | last=Adam | date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008 1.3 billion hectares of tropical regions were deforested every year. Reducing this would reduce the amount of planting needed to achieve a given degree of mitigation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\n== Incentives ==\n{{update section|date=October 2019}}\nSome incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. Streck and Scholz (2006) explain how a group of scientists from various institutions have developed a compensated reduction of deforestation approach which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation. Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided.<ref name=\"Streck\">{{Cite journal | last = Streck | first = C. |author2=S.M.

The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades.<ref name=\"Streck\"/>{{rp|876}}\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n[[File:Regrowth - Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.JPG|thumb|left|Forest regrowth in [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]], Washington state, USA]]\n\n=== Global ===\n[[Trillion Tree Campaign]] is an initiative aiming to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe.

The country has generated all of its electric power from renewable sources for three years as of 2019. It has committed to be carbon-free and plastic-free by 2021.\n\nAs of 2019, half of the country's land surface is covered with forests. They absorb a huge amount of [[carbon dioxide]], combating climate change.\n\nIn the 1940s, more than 75% of the country was covered in mostly tropical rainforests and other indigenous woodlands. Between the 1940s and 1980s extensive, uncontrolled [[logging]] led to severe deforestation. By 1983, only 26% of the country had forest cover. Realizing the devastation, policymakers took a stand. Through a continued environmental focus they were able to turn things around to the point that today forest cover has increased to 52%, 2 times more than 1983 levels.\n\nAn honorable world leader for [[ecotourism]] and conservation, Costa Rica has pioneered the development of payments for [[environmental services]].  Costa Rica's extensive system of environmental protection has been encouraging conservation and reforestation of the land by providing grants for environmental services. The system is not just advanced for its time but is also unparalleled in the world. It received great international attention.\n\nThe country has established programs to compensate landowners for reforestation.

Sometimes the term \"re-afforestation\" is used to distinguish between the [[old growth forest|original forest cover]] and the later re-growth of forest to an area. Special tools, e.g. [[tree planting bar]]s, are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.\n\nAnother alternative strategy, [[proforestation]], is similar as it can be used to counteract the negative environmental and ecological effects of deforestation through growing an existing forest intact to its full ecological potential.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\nReforestation competes with other land uses, such as food production, livestock grazing and living space, for further economic growth. Reforestation often has the tendency to create large fuel loads, resulting in significantly hotter combustion than fires involving low brush or grasses.  Reforestation can divert large amounts of water from other activities.  Reforesting sometimes results in extensive canopy creation that prevents growth of diverse vegetation in the shadowed areas and generating soil conditions that hamper other types of vegetation. Trees used in some reforesting efforts (e.g., ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') tend to extract large amounts of moisture from the soil, preventing the growth of other plants.\n\nThere is also the risk that, through a [[wildfire|forest fire]] or [[Forest pathology|insect outbreak]], much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} Reduced harvesting rates and fire suppression have caused an increase in the forest biomass in the western United States over the past century.

In some areas the suppression of [[wildfire|forest fires]] for hundreds of years has resulted in large single aged and single species [[stand level modelling|forest stands]]. The logging of small clear cuts and/or prescribed burning actually increases the biodiversity in these areas by creating a greater variety of tree stand ages and species.\n\n== For harvesting ==\n{{see also|Harvesting}}\nReforestation need not be only used for recovery of accidentally destroyed forests. In some countries, such as [[Finland]], many of the forests are ''managed'' by the wood products and [[pulp and paper industry]]. In such an arrangement, like other crops, trees are planted to replace those that have been cut. In such circumstances, the industry can cut the trees in a way to allow easier reforestation. The wood products industry systematically replaces many of the trees it cuts, employing large numbers of summer workers for [[tree planting]] work.

Even without displacing [[agriculture]] and cities, earth can sustain almost one billion hectares of new forests. This would remove 25% of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere and reduce its concentration to levels that existed in the early twentieth century. A temperature rise of 1.5 degrees would reduce the area suitable for forests by 20% by the year 2050, because some tropical areas will become too hot.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The countries that have the most forest-ready land are: [[Russia]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[United States]] and [[China]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe four major strategies are: increase the amount of forested land through reforestation; increase density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale; expand the use of forest products that sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions; and reduce carbon emissions caused by deforestation and degradation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\nImplementing the first strategy is supported by many organizations around the world. For example, in China, the [[Jane Goodall Institute]], through their Shanghai [[Roots & Shoots]] division, launched the Million Tree Project in Kulun Qi, [[Inner Mongolia]] to plant one million trees.<ref name=\"Shanghai Roots & Shoots\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jgi-shanghai.org|title=Shanghai Roots & Shoots -|work=jgi-shanghai.org|access-date=2019-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224030000/http://www.jgi-shanghai.org/|archive-date=2017-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"The Million Tree Project\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtpchina.org|title=Million Tree Project :: Home|work=mtpchina.org}}</ref> China used 2.4 billion hectares of new forest to offset 21% of Chinese fossil fuel emissions in 2000.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} In [[Java, Indonesia]] newlywed couples give whoever is conducting their wedding 5 seedlings.

In theory, planting any kind of tree to produce more forest cover would absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, a [[genetically modified]] variant might grow much faster than unmodified specimens.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | title = A changing climate of opinion? | journal = The Economist  | volume = 387 | issue =  | pages = 93\u201396 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.economist.com/help/DisplayHelp.cfm?folder=663377 | accessdate = 2010-08-29}}</ref>{{rp|93}} Some of these cultivars are under development. Such fast-growing trees would be planted for harvest and can absorb carbon dioxide faster than slower-growing trees.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nImpacts on temperature are affected by the location of the forest. For example, reforestation in boreal or [[subarctic]] regions has less impact on climate. This is because it substitutes a high-[[albedo]], snow-dominated region with a lower-albedo forest canopy. By contrast, tropical reforestation projects lead to a positive change such as the formation of [[clouds]]. These clouds then [[albedo|reflect the sunlight]], lowering temperatures.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1457}}\n\nPlanting trees in [[tropical climate]]s with [[wet season]]s has another advantage. In such a setting, trees grow more quickly (fixing more carbon) because they can grow year-round. Trees in tropical climates have, on average, larger, brighter, and more abundant leaves than non-tropical climates. A study of the [[:wikt:girth|girth]] of 70,000 trees across [[Africa]] has shown that tropical forests fix more carbon dioxide pollution than previously realized. The research suggested almost one fifth of fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across [[Africa]], [[Amazonia]] and [[Asia]]. Simon Lewis stated, \"Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels, substantially buffering the rate of change.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/18/trees-tropics-climate-change | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fifth of world carbon emissions soaked up by extra forest growth, scientists find | first=David | last=Adam | date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008 1.3 billion hectares of tropical regions were deforested every year. Reducing this would reduce the amount of planting needed to achieve a given degree of mitigation.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}}\n\n== Incentives ==\n{{update section|date=October 2019}}\nSome incentives for reforestation can be as simple as a financial compensation. Streck and Scholz (2006) explain how a group of scientists from various institutions have developed a compensated reduction of deforestation approach which would reward developing countries that disrupt any further act of deforestation. Countries that participate and take the option to reduce their emissions from deforestation during a committed period of time would receive financial compensation for the carbon dioxide emissions that they avoided.<ref name=\"Streck\">{{Cite journal | last = Streck | first = C. |author2=S.M.

The funds received by the country could be invested to help find alternatives to the extensive cutdown of forests. This whole process of cutting emissions would be voluntary, but once the country has agreed to lower their emissions they would be obligated to reduce their emissions. However, if a country was not able to meet their obligation, their target would get added to their next commitment period. The authors of these proposals see this as a solely government-to-government agreement; private entities would not participate in the compensation trades.<ref name=\"Streck\"/>{{rp|876}}\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n[[File:Regrowth - Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.JPG|thumb|left|Forest regrowth in [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]], Washington state, USA]]\n\n=== Global ===\n[[Trillion Tree Campaign]] is an initiative aiming to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe.

The country has generated all of its electric power from renewable sources for three years as of 2019. It has committed to be carbon-free and plastic-free by 2021.\n\nAs of 2019, half of the country's land surface is covered with forests. They absorb a huge amount of [[carbon dioxide]], combating climate change.\n\nIn the 1940s, more than 75% of the country was covered in mostly tropical rainforests and other indigenous woodlands. Between the 1940s and 1980s extensive, uncontrolled [[logging]] led to severe deforestation. By 1983, only 26% of the country had forest cover. Realizing the devastation, policymakers took a stand. Through a continued environmental focus they were able to turn things around to the point that today forest cover has increased to 52%, 2 times more than 1983 levels.\n\nAn honorable world leader for [[ecotourism]] and conservation, Costa Rica has pioneered the development of payments for [[environmental services]].  Costa Rica's extensive system of environmental protection has been encouraging conservation and reforestation of the land by providing grants for environmental services. The system is not just advanced for its time but is also unparalleled in the world. It received great international attention.\n\nThe country has established programs to compensate landowners for reforestation.

Sometimes the term \"re-afforestation\" is used to distinguish between the [[old growth forest|original forest cover]] and the later re-growth of forest to an area. Special tools, e.g. [[tree planting bar]]s, are used to make planting of trees easier and faster.\n\nAnother alternative strategy, [[proforestation]], is similar as it can be used to counteract the negative environmental and ecological effects of deforestation through growing an existing forest intact to its full ecological potential.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}\nReforestation competes with other land uses, such as food production, livestock grazing and living space, for further economic growth. Reforestation often has the tendency to create large fuel loads, resulting in significantly hotter combustion than fires involving low brush or grasses.  Reforestation can divert large amounts of water from other activities.  Reforesting sometimes results in extensive canopy creation that prevents growth of diverse vegetation in the shadowed areas and generating soil conditions that hamper other types of vegetation. Trees used in some reforesting efforts (e.g., ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') tend to extract large amounts of moisture from the soil, preventing the growth of other plants.\n\nThere is also the risk that, through a [[wildfire|forest fire]] or [[Forest pathology|insect outbreak]], much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.<ref name=\"Canadell\"/>{{rp|1456}} Reduced harvesting rates and fire suppression have caused an increase in the forest biomass in the western United States over the past century.

Founded as Ravenshaw College in 1868, the institution became a university in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/Content/Ravenshaw_University_Act.pdf|title= Ravenshaw University Act|publisher=ravenshawuniversity.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref> The [[university]] has nine schools, thirty three [[academic departments]] and a student enrolment of nearly 8,000. It is one of the oldest educational institutes in the country and its history is synonymous with the history of modern [[Odisha]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===  \nAfter the great famine of 1866, the people of [[Odisha]] and some liberal Britons wanted to start a college at [[Cuttack]]. [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw]], officiating commissioner of [[Odisha]] Division made the [[government]] of [[Bengal]] realise the difficulties of Oriya students in getting college educations and succeeded in obtaining permission to start collegiate classes in the Cuttack Zilla School. Thus the first college in Odisha was born in January 1868 with intermediate classes and six students. Commissioner [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw|Ravenshaw]] proposed to convert the [[Ravenshaw Collegiate School|Collegiate School]] into a full-fledged degree [[college]]. The [[government]] of [[Bengal]] accepted the demand with the condition that a public contribution of Rs.30,000 be deposited for the proposed college. [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw|Ravenshaw]] took up the matter as an object of personal interest and guaranteed the collection of the required amount. H. Woodrew, DPI of [[Bengal]] supported Ravenshaw. H. J. Reynolds, [[secretary]] to the government of Bengal requested the government of [[India]] to sanction the incidental charges and the post of the principal on the additional condition of meeting half the monthly expenses by public donation. Due to Ravenshaw's efforts and the financial support of Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]], HH Shri [[Mayurbhanj Palace|Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo]], the college department of the Collegiate School was converted in 1876 to a full-fledged [[College|Government Degree College]] bearing the name [[Cuttack]] College affiliated to the [[University of Calcutta]]. Samuel Ager was appointed as the first principal. The college had only 19 students. H.H. Sri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo donated Rs. 20,000 as a permanent endowment which almost fulfilled the condition imposed by the government for public contribution. On his insistence the name was changed to Ravenshaw College in 1878 after [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw]] to commemorate his services to the cause of education in [[Odisha]]. The college was granted permanent status by 1881. Growth in the initial days was slow. Altogether 94 graduates were produced by the closing year of the 19th century and the student strength had increased to 97. Science stream remained confined only to intermediate level until 1912 when Bihar and Odisha were separated from Bengal.it is the college where many of our freedom fighters have completed their graduation.\n\n{{wide image|Ravenshaw Panorama1.jpg|1020px|Panoramic view of Ravenshaw University, main entry, 2011}}\n\n===Ravenshaw in the 20th century===\nThe college entered a new phase of development after 1912. School and survey classes were removed. Teachers of Indian Education Service were appointed as professors. New subjects such as Political Economy, Political Philosophy and honours in History and Persian were introduced. Infrastructure facilities for teaching of science at B.Sc. level were augmented. The student strength rose to 280 in 1912 and 375 in 1915. A new site (the present site) for the college at Chakkar Padia was located by the government to construct a complete set of new buildings at an approximate cost of Rs.10,00,000. In 1916 the University Bill proposed the transfer of Ravenshaw College from Calcutta University to Patna University. Although there was some public resistance for the change of affiliation, the then commissioner rightly supported the transfer by writing \"Divorced from the Calcutta University, its progress would be rapid and in course of time it should be able to supply every educational need of the people of Odisha.\" Accordingly, the affiliation was transferred to newly created Patna University on 1 October 1917.\nThe college was shifted to its present site in the erstwhile Chakkar Padia in 1921. While laying the foundation stone of the present building in November 1919 Sir Edward Gait, the governor of Bihar and Odisha wished that this mighty monument would one day grow into a university. The Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]] donated Rs. 1,00,000 for the electrification of the new building and purchase of equipment for science laboratories. A library building with an area of {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} was opened in 1922 by Lt. Governor of Bihar and Odisha. Maharaja of Kanika Sri Rajendra Narayan Bhanjadeo generously donated Rs. 55,000 for its construction which stands today as a beautiful piece of architecture. In his honour the library is named Kanika Library and is very close to the hearts of educated Odias. In recognition of the public generosity, the government sanctioned Rs. 25,000 towards purchase of books for the new Kanika Library. After the shifting of the main library to the centenary building, the old premises houses the journal section. Legislators from Odisha such as Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das and Sri Krishna Mohapatra demanded time and again for further growth of the college in Bihar Odisha Legislative Council and Viceroy's Council. In the words of Krishna Mohapatra \"Orissa had a pet child and that child was the Ravenshaw College.\" In response to public pressure, Mathematics honours got recognition by 1920. A year later affiliation was granted to B.Sc. in Botany and the college became a postgraduate institution with M.A. classes in English started in 1922 through the munificence of Maharani Smt. Parvati Devi, the queen of [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]], in granting Rs. 1,71,500 for its opening.\nThe staff position of Ravenshaw College was strengthened with the appointment, in 1918, of scholars such as Sir Jaudunath Sarkar and R. P. Khosla as professors of History and Economics respectively. By 1922 the sanctioned strength of teaching staff had reached 31, out of which 13 came from Indian Education Service, two were Europeans and the rest were from provincial Education Service. Honours classes in Physics, Chemistry and Botany were opened from July 1930 and steps were initiated to start postgraduate teaching in all subjects which was fulfilled after Odisha became a separate province. Co-education began in 1929\u201330 with four girl students taking admission in the college. Their number gradually rose over the years. Medical facilities opened in the college with the appointment of a sub-assistant surgeon and medical examination became compulsory for all students from October 1929.\nThe college remained affiliated to [[Patna University]] even after the separation of Odisha from Bihar in 1936. The affiliation was transferred to the newly-created Utkal University in 1943. In fact, it was Ravenshaw College that gave birth to the new university, nursed and sustained it. If walls could speak, the present zoology department building could say how the university started functioning on its premises more than half a century ago. The law department of Ravenshaw College was separated and gave birth to the Madhusudan Law College.\n\n===Ravenshaw in the freedom struggle===\nRavenshaw's Assembly Hall was the venue of the Legislative Assembly of the new state of Odisha. It witnessed the debates of the legislators framing laws to govern the state. It remained so until the capital was shifted to Bhubaneswar. All the significant cultural, intellectual and political movements of the state have sprung from its portals. It has nourished such great and kindred souls as [[Madhusudan Das]], [[Gopabandhu Das]], Acharya Harihara Das, [[Nilakantha Das]], [[Godabaris Mishra]] and Bhubanananda Das. It had on its staff such great scholars as Artaballav Mohanty, [[Jadunath Sarkar]], Sir Ross Masood, [[Pranakrushna Parija]], Balabhadra Prasad, Acharya Jogeschandra Vidyanidhi, Mahendra Kumar Rout, Baba Kartar Singh, Parasuram Mishra, Shri P.A. Sunderam and A.K. Dasgupata, to name a few. Most of the prominent political leaders of the state such as Shri Biswanath Das, H.K. Mahatab, Shri Nityananda Kanungo, Shri S.N.Dwibedi, Shri [[Biju Patnaik]], Shri Nilamani Routray, Smt. Nandini Satpathy, Shri Janaki Ballav Patnaik and Shri Rabi Ray etc., were Ravenshavians. The college produced such creative writers of yesteryear as Sri Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Sri Ananda Shankar Ray, Sri [[Gopinath Mohanty]], Sri Sachidananda Routray and Sri Surendranath Mohanty. In short, the college has been the major source of preparing manpower to lead every sphere of the society. In the Dimond Jubilee celebration address the then principal H.R. Batheja rightly observed: \"we have at last a temple of learning, fair to look on, stately in proportions which compares not unfavorably with the only other temple&nbsp;\u2013 The temple of Jaganath for which Odisha is known all over India. The twin monuments represent Odisha to the outside world and are source of justice and pride to every Oriya\".\n\n===Ravenshaw after independence===\n[[File:Ravenshaw Convention Centre,Ravenshaw University,Cuttack.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Ravenshaw Convention Centre]]\nIndian Science Congress Association meet of 1962 was held in Ravenshaw College Quadrangle. The College achieved the unique distinction of being one of the three colleges of the country to have been awarded national honour by the government of India through the issue of a commemorative stamp in 1978. The college has seen 55 principals. It has been accorded autonomous status since 1989. It stands today on a sprawling campus of {{convert|87.4|acre|m2}}. The magnificent red brick building of Gothic architecture has had several blocks added to it. The main library is in the new centenary library building. \n[[Government of Odisha]] accorded it unitary [[state university]] status in the year 2006 by passing the Ravenshaw University act. Subsequently, it got accredited with [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] under the section 2f of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/stateuniversitylist.aspx?id=26&Unitype=2|title= Ravenshaw University-UGC|publisher=ugc.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>  This was possible because of the efforts of the first vice chancellor of the [[university]], [[Devdas Chhotray]]. Since then a number of self-financing courses have been offered and the student strength has increased dramatically. Teaching is now imparted to more than 7000 students in Arts, Science and Commerce, management, computer science, electronics and telecommunication, information technology and hotel and hospitality management. Altogether there are 33 [[academic departments]] out of which 28 have postgraduate teaching facility and [[master of philosophy|M.Phil.]] and [[doctorate|Ph.D.]] courses are available in 22 departments. In addition, several new courses have been added under autonomous functioning besides the regular courses. There are 11 hostels, 9 of which are on the campus, accommodating about 2,500 boarders. A new 140 acre campus is being built at Naraj in Cuttack. The college houses, besides Ravenshaw Junior College having student strength of 1536, the Cuttack Study Centre of Indira Gandhi National Open University having student strength of 1133, IAS Coaching Class and Pre-Examination Training Centre for SC/ST students. The campus has a post office, an extension counter of the State Bank of India, a dispensary, a powerhouse, GED, PWD and PHS sections, a canteen, guest house, a gymnasium, and spacious play grounds. Ravenshaw has acquired a distinctive, secular, cosmopolitan culture of its own helping all Ravenshawvians to live in the [[University]] motto \"Skill is our power\".\n\n===Emblem===\nThe emblem is designed in three segments, separated by a river and its tributaries. The microscope on left symbolizes the insatiable human spirit of enquiry and scientific research fostered by this institution. The palm leaf manuscripts on a stand with a writing instrument on the right represent the great storehouse of accumulated wisdom of past generations and the pursuit of creativity which are the hallmarks of this institution. The open book at the bottom epitomizes the dissemination of knowledge and wisdom which the college inculcates in its countless scholars. The river and its tributaries suggest the endless flow of knowledge through great stretches of time and the perennial flow of life, its unity and diversity.\n\n==Academics==\nRavenshaw University has nine [[Academic degree|degree-granting]] [[institutes|schools]] and they offer [[Academic major|undergraduate]] programs in science, arts, commerce, management, computer science, electronics and telecommunication, hospitality and hotel management and information technology; [[Graduate school|graduate]] programs in science, arts, commerce, management (MBA) and computer application (MCA); and [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degree programs in science, arts and commerce.\n\n===Schools and Departments===\n*'''School of Languages''' (Departments: Hindi, Odia, Sanskrit and English)\n*'''School of Regional Studies & Earth Sciences''' (Departments: Geology and Applied geography)\n*'''School of Social Sciences''' (Departments: Economics, History, Philosophy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Sociology, International Studies, Rural Development, Education and Journalism and Mass Communication)\n*'''School of Life Sciences''' (Departments: Botany, Biotechnology and Zoology)\n*'''School of Mathematical Sciences''' (Departments: Mathematics and Statistics)\n*'''School of Information & Computer Sciences''' (Departments: Electronics and Telecommunication, Information Science and Technology, Information Technology and Management, Computer Science and Computer Applications)\n*'''School of Physical Sciences''' (Departments: Chemistry and Physics)\n*'''School of Commerce''' (Department of Commerce)\n*'''School of Management Studies''' (Departments: Business Administration, Hospitality & Hotel Administration, Integrated MBA in Financial Markets and MBA)\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmissions to various [[Academic major|undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degree programs are made through entrance examinations held every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eadmission.ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/|title= Ravenshaw University Admissions|publisher=ravenshawuniversity.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\n\nRavenshaw has been at the forefront of the research activities since its inception. Established as the first institution of [[Odisha]] for higher education, [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees were awarded by the various departments of Ravenshaw for the first time in the history of [[Odisha]]. However, keeping in mind the changing scenario of modern science and technology, its research infrastructure and library facilities are now being augmented through external research grants and internal resources. Currently 22 departments of the [[university]] offer [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eadmission.ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/courses-offered.php|title= Courses offered|publisher=ravenshawuniversity.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe current campus sits on an 87-acre campus in the heart of [[Cuttack]].

Founded as Ravenshaw College in 1868, the institution became a university in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/Content/Ravenshaw_University_Act.pdf|title= Ravenshaw University Act|publisher=ravenshawuniversity.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref> The [[university]] has nine schools, thirty three [[academic departments]] and a student enrolment of nearly 8,000. It is one of the oldest educational institutes in the country and its history is synonymous with the history of modern [[Odisha]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===  \nAfter the great famine of 1866, the people of [[Odisha]] and some liberal Britons wanted to start a college at [[Cuttack]]. [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw]], officiating commissioner of [[Odisha]] Division made the [[government]] of [[Bengal]] realise the difficulties of Oriya students in getting college educations and succeeded in obtaining permission to start collegiate classes in the Cuttack Zilla School. Thus the first college in Odisha was born in January 1868 with intermediate classes and six students. Commissioner [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw|Ravenshaw]] proposed to convert the [[Ravenshaw Collegiate School|Collegiate School]] into a full-fledged degree [[college]]. The [[government]] of [[Bengal]] accepted the demand with the condition that a public contribution of Rs.30,000 be deposited for the proposed college. [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw|Ravenshaw]] took up the matter as an object of personal interest and guaranteed the collection of the required amount. H. Woodrew, DPI of [[Bengal]] supported Ravenshaw. H. J. Reynolds, [[secretary]] to the government of Bengal requested the government of [[India]] to sanction the incidental charges and the post of the principal on the additional condition of meeting half the monthly expenses by public donation. Due to Ravenshaw's efforts and the financial support of Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]], HH Shri [[Mayurbhanj Palace|Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo]], the college department of the Collegiate School was converted in 1876 to a full-fledged [[College|Government Degree College]] bearing the name [[Cuttack]] College affiliated to the [[University of Calcutta]]. Samuel Ager was appointed as the first principal. The college had only 19 students. H.H. Sri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo donated Rs. 20,000 as a permanent endowment which almost fulfilled the condition imposed by the government for public contribution. On his insistence the name was changed to Ravenshaw College in 1878 after [[Thomas Edward Ravenshaw]] to commemorate his services to the cause of education in [[Odisha]]. The college was granted permanent status by 1881. Growth in the initial days was slow. Altogether 94 graduates were produced by the closing year of the 19th century and the student strength had increased to 97. Science stream remained confined only to intermediate level until 1912 when Bihar and Odisha were separated from Bengal.it is the college where many of our freedom fighters have completed their graduation.\n\n{{wide image|Ravenshaw Panorama1.jpg|1020px|Panoramic view of Ravenshaw University, main entry, 2011}}\n\n===Ravenshaw in the 20th century===\nThe college entered a new phase of development after 1912. School and survey classes were removed. Teachers of Indian Education Service were appointed as professors. New subjects such as Political Economy, Political Philosophy and honours in History and Persian were introduced. Infrastructure facilities for teaching of science at B.Sc. level were augmented. The student strength rose to 280 in 1912 and 375 in 1915. A new site (the present site) for the college at Chakkar Padia was located by the government to construct a complete set of new buildings at an approximate cost of Rs.10,00,000. In 1916 the University Bill proposed the transfer of Ravenshaw College from Calcutta University to Patna University. Although there was some public resistance for the change of affiliation, the then commissioner rightly supported the transfer by writing \"Divorced from the Calcutta University, its progress would be rapid and in course of time it should be able to supply every educational need of the people of Odisha.\" Accordingly, the affiliation was transferred to newly created Patna University on 1 October 1917.\nThe college was shifted to its present site in the erstwhile Chakkar Padia in 1921. While laying the foundation stone of the present building in November 1919 Sir Edward Gait, the governor of Bihar and Odisha wished that this mighty monument would one day grow into a university. The Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]] donated Rs. 1,00,000 for the electrification of the new building and purchase of equipment for science laboratories. A library building with an area of {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} was opened in 1922 by Lt. Governor of Bihar and Odisha. Maharaja of Kanika Sri Rajendra Narayan Bhanjadeo generously donated Rs. 55,000 for its construction which stands today as a beautiful piece of architecture. In his honour the library is named Kanika Library and is very close to the hearts of educated Odias. In recognition of the public generosity, the government sanctioned Rs. 25,000 towards purchase of books for the new Kanika Library. After the shifting of the main library to the centenary building, the old premises houses the journal section. Legislators from Odisha such as Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das and Sri Krishna Mohapatra demanded time and again for further growth of the college in Bihar Odisha Legislative Council and Viceroy\u2019s Council. In the words of Krishna Mohapatra \"Orissa had a pet child and that child was the Ravenshaw College.\" In response to public pressure, Mathematics honours got recognition by 1920. A year later affiliation was granted to B.Sc. in Botany and the college became a postgraduate institution with M.A. classes in English started in 1922 through the munificence of Maharani Smt. Parvati Devi, the queen of [[Sonepur, Odisha|Sonepur]], in granting Rs. 1,71,500 for its opening.\nThe staff position of Ravenshaw College was strengthened with the appointment, in 1918, of scholars such as Sir Jaudunath Sarkar and R. P. Khosla as professors of History and Economics respectively. By 1922 the sanctioned strength of teaching staff had reached 31, out of which 13 came from Indian Education Service, two were Europeans and the rest were from provincial Education Service. Honours classes in Physics, Chemistry and Botany were opened from July 1930 and steps were initiated to start postgraduate teaching in all subjects which was fulfilled after Odisha became a separate province. Co-education began in 1929-30 with four girl students taking admission in the college. Their number gradually rose over the years. Medical facilities opened in the college with the appointment of a sub-assistant surgeon and medical examination became compulsory for all students from October 1929.\nThe college remained affiliated to [[Patna University]] even after the separation of Odisha from Bihar in 1936. The affiliation was transferred to the newly-created Utkal University in 1943. In fact, it was Ravenshaw College that gave birth to the new university, nursed and sustained it. If walls could speak, the present zoology department building could say how the university started functioning on its premises more than half a century ago. The law department of Ravenshaw College was separated and gave birth to the Madhusudan Law College.\n\n===Ravenshaw in the freedom struggle===\nRavenshaw's Assembly Hall was the venue of the Legislative Assembly of the new state of Odisha. It witnessed the debates of the legislators framing laws to govern the state. It remained so until the capital was shifted to Bhubaneswar. All the significant cultural, intellectual and political movements of the state have sprung from its portals. It has nourished such great and kindred souls as [[Madhusudan Das]], [[Gopabandhu Das]], Acharya Harihara Das, [[Nilakantha Das]], [[Godabaris Mishra]] and Bhubanananda Das. It had on its staff such great scholars as Artaballav Mohanty, [[Jadunath Sarkar]], Sir Ross Masood, [[Pranakrushna Parija]], Balabhadra Prasad, Acharya Jogeschandra Vidyanidhi, Mahendra Kumar Rout, Baba Kartar Singh, Parasuram Mishra, Shri P.A. Sunderam and A.K. Dasgupata, to name a few. Most of the prominent political leaders of the state such as Shri Biswanath Das, H.K. Mahatab, Shri Nityananda Kanungo, Shri S.N.Dwibedi, Shri [[Biju Patnaik]], Shri Nilamani Routray, Smt. Nandini Satpathy, Shri Janaki Ballav Patnaik and Shri Rabi Ray etc., were Ravenshavians. The college produced such creative writers of yesteryear as Sri Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Sri Ananda Shankar Ray, Sri [[Gopinath Mohanty]], Sri Sachidananda Routray and Sri Surendranath Mohanty. In short, the college has been the major source of preparing manpower to lead every sphere of the society. In the Dimond Jubilee celebration address the then principal H.R. Batheja rightly observed: \"we have at last a temple of learning, fair to look on, stately in proportions which compares not unfavorably with the only other temple&nbsp;\u2013 The temple of Jaganath for which Odisha is known all over India. The twin monuments represent Odisha to the outside world and are source of justice and pride to every Oriya\".\n\n===Ravenshaw after independence===\n[[File:Ravenshaw Convention Centre,Ravenshaw University,Cuttack.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Ravenshaw Convention Centre]]\nIndian Science Congress Association meet of 1962 was held in Ravenshaw College Quadrangle. The College achieved the unique distinction of being one of the three colleges of the country to have been awarded national honour by the government of India through the issue of a commemorative stamp in 1978. The college has seen 55 principals. It has been accorded autonomous status since 1989. It stands today on a sprawling campus of {{convert|87.4|acre|m2}}. The magnificent red brick building of Gothic architecture has had several blocks added to it. The main library is in the new centenary library building. \n[[Government of Odisha]] accorded it unitary [[state university]] status in the year 2006 by passing the Ravenshaw University act. Subsequently, it got accredited with [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] under the section 2f of the [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/stateuniversitylist.aspx?id=26&Unitype=2|title= Ravenshaw University-UGC|publisher=ugc.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>  This was possible because of the efforts of the first vice chancellor of the [[university]], [[Devdas Chhotray]]. Since then a number of self-financing courses have been offered and the student strength has increased dramatically. Teaching is now imparted to more than 7000 students in Arts, Science and Commerce, management, computer science, electronics and telecommunication, information technology and hotel and hospitality management. Altogether there are 33 [[academic departments]] out of which 28 have postgraduate teaching facility and [[master of philosophy|M.Phil.]] and [[doctorate|Ph.D.]] courses are available in 22 departments. In addition, several new courses have been added under autonomous functioning besides the regular courses. There are 11 hostels, 9 of which are on the campus, accommodating about 2,500 boarders. A new 140 acre campus is being built at Naraj in Cuttack. The college houses, besides Ravenshaw Junior College having student strength of 1536, the Cuttack Study Centre of Indira Gandhi National Open University having student strength of 1133, IAS Coaching Class and Pre-Examination Training Centre for SC/ST students. The campus has a post office, an extension counter of the State Bank of India, a dispensary, a powerhouse, GED, PWD and PHS sections, a canteen, guest house, a gymnasium, and spacious play grounds. Ravenshaw has acquired a distinctive, secular, cosmopolitan culture of its own helping all Ravenshawvians to live in the [[University]] motto \"Skill is our power\".\n\n===Emblem===\nThe emblem is designed in three segments, separated by a river and its tributaries. The microscope on left symbolizes the insatiable human spirit of enquiry and scientific research fostered by this institution. The palm leaf manuscripts on a stand with a writing instrument on the right represent the great storehouse of accumulated wisdom of past generations and the pursuit of creativity which are the hallmarks of this institution. The open book at the bottom epitomizes the dissemination of knowledge and wisdom which the college inculcates in its countless scholars. The river and its tributaries suggest the endless flow of knowledge through great stretches of time and the perennial flow of life, its unity and diversity.\n\n==Academics==\nRavenshaw University has nine [[Academic degree|degree-granting]] [[institutes|schools]] and they offer [[Academic major|undergraduate]] programs in science, arts, commerce, management, computer science, electronics and telecommunication, hospitality and hotel management and information technology; [[Graduate school|graduate]] programs in science, arts, commerce, management (MBA) and computer application (MCA); and [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degree programs in science, arts and commerce.\n\n===Schools and Departments===\n*'''School of Languages''' (Departments: Hindi, Odia, Sanskrit and English)\n*'''School of Regional Studies & Earth Sciences''' (Departments: Geology and Applied geography)\n*'''School of Social Sciences''' (Departments: Economics, History, Philosophy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Sociology, International Studies, Rural Development, Education and Journalism and Mass Communication)\n*'''School of Life Sciences''' (Departments: Botany, Biotechnology and Zoology)\n*'''School of Mathematical Sciences''' (Departments: Mathematics and Statistics)\n*'''School of Information & Computer Sciences''' (Departments: Electronics and Telecommunication, Information Science and Technology, Information Technology and Management, Computer Science and Computer Applications)\n*'''School of Physical Sciences''' (Departments: Chemistry and Physics)\n*'''School of Commerce''' (Department of Commerce)\n*'''School of Management Studies''' (Departments: Business Administration, Hospitality & Hotel Administration, Integrated MBA in Financial Markets and MBA)\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmissions to various [[Academic major|undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degree programs are made through entrance examinations held every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eadmission.ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/|title= Ravenshaw University Admissions|publisher=ravenshawuniversity.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Research===\n\nRavenshaw has been at the forefront of the research activities since its inception. Established as the first institution of [[Odisha]] for higher education, [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees were awarded by the various departments of Ravenshaw for the first time in the history of [[Odisha]]. However, keeping in mind the changing scenario of modern science and technology, its research infrastructure and library facilities are now being augmented through external research grants and internal resources. Currently 22 departments of the [[university]] offer [[master of philosophy]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eadmission.ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/courses-offered.php|title= Courses offered|publisher=ravenshawuniversity.ac.in|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe current campus sits on an 87-acre campus in the heart of [[Cuttack]].

It has been recognized by [[Medical Council of India]] (MCI) as an ideal undergraduate institution facilitating education and training in super specialty subjects under medical and surgical disciplines.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Superintendant office.jpg|right|Office of the Superintendent |200px|thumb]]\nThe evolution of this institution dates back to the beginning of the 19th century. It took its birth as a small [[dispensary]] as [[First Aid Centre]] in the premises of the present medical college during the days of Maharatha rule in the later half of the eighteenth century. The sole purpose of that dispensary was to render whatever little medical assistance was available and feasible to the sick pilgrims en route to and from Puri, especially during the \"Car Festival\" of Lord Jagannath.\n\nThis dispensary continued to function admirably till the British occupation of Orissa in 1803. The British rulers, in due course of time, realized the strategic importance of this dispensary at [[Cuttack]] and converted it into small hospital. For smooth management of the Hospital, they made provisions for pumping adequate money from the \"Annachhatra Fund\".\n\nIn 1875, the Orissa Medical School was born and saw the light of the day by the effort of a large hearted Briton, Dr Stewart, the then Civil Surgeon of Cuttack as its first Principal. he mooted out the idea of starting a medical school, utilizing this hospital as an infrastructural nucleus.

It was affiliated to the Bihar and Orissa Medical Examination Board which grantee the LMP Diploma.\n\nIn 1944, the Orissa Medical School was renamed as Orissa Medical College and Major A.T Anderson, the then Civil Surgeon of Cuttack acted as its first Principal. he wanted to improve the Orissa Medical College as per the pattern existed in U.K which was highly appreciated by Lt.Col.A.N.Chopra, the then Director of Health and I.G, Prisons. They recommended to the Government to upgrade the existing medical school to the status of College. The Parla Ministry consisting of Maharaja of Paralakhemundi. Maharaja Krishna Chandra Gajapati Dev, Mr Abdus Subhan Khan (Minister of Health and Education) and Pandit Godabrish Misra gave due attention to this issue and finally the Orissa Medical College was born on 1 June 1944 with a capacity of 22 students into MBBS Degree Course.\n\nThe College was affiliated to Utkal University and the first batch appeared in the Final MBBS Examination in 1948. The College received recognition for MBBS degree from Medical Council of Indian in the year 1952 with retrospective effect.\n\nIn 1951, the Orissa Medical College was subsequently renamed as SRIRAM CHANDRA BHANJ MEDICAL COLLEGE in recognition of the donation and efforts made by [[Mayurbhanj State]] Maharaja [[Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo]]. The college received recognition for MBBS degree from [[Medical Council of India]] in 1952 with retrospective effect. Postgraduate courses in M.D./M.S. specialties were started in 1960. Since 1981, [[Post doc|post-doctoral]] training leading to the award of D.M. and M.Ch. degrees have been instituted in the disciplines of [[Cardiology]] and [[Neurosurgery]] respectively.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo Medical College.jpg|right|Department of Microbiology|thumb]]\nSCB Medical College provides degree courses for MBBS, MD, MS, DM, MCh and diploma courses. Its intake for MBBS courses is 250 and for postgraduate courses it is approximately 150. A [[Dentistry|dental]] wing in the college campus imparts B.D.S. degrees under [[Utkal University]]. At present this college extends facility for postgraduate training in all the 21 broad specialties.\n\nThe college offers the four-and-a-half-year M.B.B.S. course with a one-year compulsory rotating internship in affiliated hospitals. There are 250 seats, all the seats are filled through a single window all india medical test known as NEET-UG of which 85% admissions are done  by the [[Odisha Joint Entrance Examination]] (OJEE) at the state level and 15% through NEET counselling at the national level. Admission is extremely competitive.\n\nThe college offers more than 150 seats in post graduate courses. Admission is through the Odisha Post Graduate Medical Examination (50%) and at the national level through the [[All India Post Graduate Medical Entrance Examination]].\n\nNational programmes like family Welfare Training in Regional Family Welfare Training Centre, Post Partum Programme attached to Obstetrics & Gynecology Department, ICMR Programme, IGNOU study center, Regional Spinal injury center and treatment of Geriatric patients in Geriatric OPD are functioning in this institution.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:SCB Hostel.jpg|right|Old Gents Hostel|200px|thumb]]\nUndergraduate and post graduate students hail from all over [[India]]. The campus has five hostels including Old Gents Hostel and New Gents Hostel for undergraduate men. It has one each hostel for undergraduate women, postgraduate women, postgraduate men, house staff students and nursing students.\n\nBoth undergraduate and post graduate students ([[Junior Doctor's Association]]) have their union. Representatives of the student body are elected annually in a campus-wide election.\n\nThe inter-collegiate cultural, literary and sports festival of SCB Medical College is called [[Synapse]] and is held in late December and early January every year. It is organized by the Students Union. In addition, the Students Union holds annual inter-class competitions where undergraduate students within SCB Medical College compete in cultural, literary and sporting events.\n\nEach hostel has an air-conditioned TV room and one reading room. The campus has many canteens for students and staff. The campus also has a [[Gym]]nasium for men and women and grounds for [[cricket]], [[tennis]] and [[basketball]]. It has also a [[swimming pool]] for students . Every year the students organise picnic which means a great moment of joy between the hectic academic sessions.\n\n===Library===\nA student library is inside the campus with more than 500 seats having sections for undergraduate and postgraduate students. The Central Library is one of the best referral medical libraries in the state of Odisha. The library has installed [[Air Conditioner|air conditioning]] for the whole library. It has been declared as resource library in the Eastern Region by Govt. of India in the year 1993.\n\n==Medical facilities==\n[[File:SCB Out patient dept.jpg|right|Out Patient Department|200px|thumb]]\n{{weasel|date=May 2015}}\nDoctors and staff at SCB Medical College strive to provide comprehensive, high-quality tertiary care services including specialty and super-specialty services to all without consideration of caste, creed, religion, sex, economic status or disability. However, there may be some deficiencies due to extreme patient load and finite resources. Acquiring newer equipment for investigation, research and patient care is expedited as it is not constrained by funds.\n\nThe hospital provides service at its [[Outpatient department]], [[Emergency department|Casualty]] and indoor services.

On top of that, starting circa 480 C.E. [[Alchon Huns|Alchon Hun]] armies began attacking the declining empire from multiple sides. Defence of the vast empire put a strain on the royal treasury. Though the Huns were initially driven out, the protracted invasions quickened the downfall of the Gupta kings. It may be noted that Indian archeologist Shanker Sharma has argued that the empire's end was precipitated by a massive deluge around the middle of the sixth century C.E.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raj |first1=Dev |title=Deluge drowned mighty Guptas: Study |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/deluge-drowned-mighty-guptas-study/cid/1685500 |website=www.telegraphindia.com |accessdate=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nNear the end of the sixth century, the empire was ruled over by a feeble ruler belonging to the [[Later Gupta dynasty]], Mahasenagupta (r. c. 562-601 C.E.).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> The [[Gupta Empire#Decline of the empire|decline of the Gupta empire]] had left the disintegrating empire in chaos. Numerous local kings and rulers like [[Yashodharman]] emerged, and started vying for control of the many pieces of the former empire. Shashanka emerged as one of these ambitious local rulers, aiming to seize control of Gauda and its surrounding region.\n\n[[File:Rohtasgarh Fort Inside Side View.jpg|thumb|The Rohtasgarh Fort, built circa 7th century]]\nThe first mention of Shashanka is found in the 7th century hill fort [[Rohtas Fort|Rohtasgarh]] in the small town of Rohtas in the kingdom of Magadha. The seal bore a curt inscription, \"Mahasamanta Shashankadeva.\"\n\nSome historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha [[samanta]]) under Mahasenagupta, of the [[Later Gupta dynasty|Later Gupta Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=N.

Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as ''maha samanta'' to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=World Monarchies and Dynasties |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317451587 |page=330 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=R63ACQAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the [[Gauda Kingdom]]. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as ''Maharajadhiraja'' (king of great kings).\n\n== Military campaigns and warfare ==\nNot many historical references to the Gauda Army are available. Like its predecessor, the Late Gupta army, Shashanka's army had infantry and cavalry units. D. C. Sircar (1990) reports that the Gauda army also fielded a strong elephant corps in Kamarupa.<ref name=\"Sircar_Assam\">{{cite book |last1=Sircar |first1=D C |title=Political History, in Barpujari, H K (ed.), The Comprehensive History of Assam (Vol-1) |date=1990 |publisher=Publication Board, Assam |location=Guwahati, India |pages=94\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nKamarupa king [[Bhaskaravarman]] describes the Gauda army as fielding a strong naval force.<ref name=\"Sircar_Geography_1971\">{{cite book |last1=Sircar |first1=Dineschandra |title=Studies in the Geography of Ancient and Medieval India |date=1971 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |location=India |isbn=9788120806900 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=AqKw1Mn8WcwC |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Campaign against the Varmans of Kamarupa (Assam) ===\nIt appears that between 595-600 C.E. the Gauda army had carried out attacks against the [[Varman dynasty|Varman King]] of Kamrupa (Assam). The Varman king died early in the war, and his two sons stepped up. The Doobi Copper Plate inscriptions tell us that the Gauda army fought and defeated the king, and princes Supratisthita and Bhaskara of Kamrupa.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\">{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1=Hans |title=The World of the Skandapur\u0101\u1e47a |date=2014 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004277144 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=6p2XCgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref> The princes are described as fighting a mighty elephantry force.\n\nThe princes were brought back to Gauda as prisoners, but released shortly thereafter. They supposedly returned to their kingdom as feudatories under Shashanka. The younger of the two would soon turn against the Gauda.\n\n=== Campaign against the Maukharis of Kanyakubja (Kanauj) ===\nHans Bakker argues that the army that set out to attack the Maukharis in Kanyakubja was more of a \"confederation of all those who held a grudge\", and that it was led by Shashanka.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\" />\n\nNow because the ruling dynasties of Kanyakubja and Sthaniswara were related by matrimony, Thanesar king [[Rajyavardhana]] immediately set out with 10,000 cavalrymen to recapture Kanyakubja and avenge his sister Rajyashri. Rajyavardhana fought and killed Devagupta on the way. As he continued towards Kanyakubja, he came across Shashanka's army. Circa 606 C.E. Rajyavardhana was killed by Shashanka. No conclusive evidence exists but it is possible that Shashanka, who joined the battle as an ally of [[Devagupta]], murdered him. The only source available in this matter is the ''[[Harshacharita]]'' by [[B\u0101\u1e47abha\u1e6d\u1e6da]], who was a childhood friend and constant companion of [[Harsha]]; neither of these men were present at the death.\n\n=== War with [[Harsha]] of Sthanisvara (Thanesar) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nHarsha succeeded his brother as ruler of Thanesar in 606 C.E. and he once again gathered the army and attacked Kannauj. Shashanka and his allies fought a major war with the then emperor of [[Thanesar]], [[Harsha]], and his allies. It is evident that Shashanka had to retreat from Kannauj. The result of the battle was inconclusive as Shashanka is documented to have retained dominion over his lands. Shashanka continued to rule Gauda with frequent attacks from Harsha, which he is known to have faced bravely.\n\n== Extent of kingdom ==\n\nShashanka first established himself in [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]], and set his eyes on Magadha. Magadha at that time was under Maukhari rule, and Shashanka vowed to free it again.\n\nSen (1977) has shown that none other than Shashanka could have defeated the [[Maukhari dynasty|Maukhari]] rulers of Magadha.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> Next,\nhe focused on extending his kingdom to [[Odissi|Odissa]], parts of Central Provinces, and Bihar.\n\nThough Shashanka remains known, and referred to, as the Lord of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]], his kingdom included more than just that region. By the end of his reign, his domain stretched from [[Vanga (Bengal)|Vanga]] to [[Bhubaneswar|Bhuvanesha]] while in the east, his kingdom bordered [[Kamarupa]].\n\n=== Peak of Gauda Kingdom's expansion ===\nAt its peak, Shashanka's kingdom and conquests included the following small kingdoms, provinces, principalities and feudatory estates (in alphabetical order):<ref name=\"History_UK\" /> \n* Chandradwipa (southern Bangladesh) \n* Dandabhukti (southern West Bengal) \n* Gauda (parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh) \n* Harikela (north-eastern Bangladesh) \n* Kamrupa (Assam)\n* Karna Subarna (part of West Bengal) \n* Lukhnauti (North Bengal and Bihar) \n* Navyabakashika (central and southern Bangladesh) \n* Pundra Vardhana (now northern Bangladesh) \n* Rarh (southern areas of West Bengal) \n* Samatata (eastern Bangladesh)\n* Subarnabithi (central Bangladesh)\n* Summha Desa (south-western West Bengal) \n* Vanga (central Bangladesh)\n* Vangala (southern Bangladesh) \n* Varendra (northern Bangladesh)\n\nWhether all of the above came into the folds of the kingdom during Shashanka's lifetime, is not known. Also, while Shashanka is known to have occupied both Kamrupa and Kanyakubja, he could/did not hold on to either for long. Some historians maintain that Shashanka annexed Jharkhand as well.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Rajak |first=Jay Prakash |date=October 2012 |title=Geographical analysis of the dimensions of population characteristics in Jharkhand State |type=PhD |chapter=History and Location of Jharkhand |chapter-url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/103438/9/09_chapter%203.pdf |publisher=Visva-Bharati University |page=42 |hdl=10603/103438 |access-date=}}</ref>{{better source|reason=Citation is to a background chapter of the thesis of a geographer, not a historian, and they cite no sources for their statement that Shashank controled Jharkhand.|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Rule and administration ==\n\n[[File:Sasanka Deva king of Gauda circa 600-630.jpg|thumb|Coin of \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka-deva, king of Gauda, circa 600\u2013630.

Many historians and commentators argue that Shashanka was the first independent king of not only Gauda, but of Bengal. As such he is a symbolic figure in the region's aspirations for independence and self-rule.\n\nShashanka's feat in bringing the many tribes and kingdoms under a single flag becomes clear only after his death.

The villagers replied that they suffered from an acute shortage of water.\n\nSo Shashank's mother urged her son to do something for the villagers, so that they still had water during the lean season. Not one to disobey his mother's wishes, Shashanka reportedly pulled out an arrow from his sheath, and announced that he would excavate a reservoir as long as the arrow's trajectory. And thus, over a period of three years, and with help from local nobles, Sarasanka came into existence.\n\n=== Shashanka (fiction) ===\nPublished in 1914, Shashanka is a historical novel penned by the famous Indian archaeologist [[R.

On top of that, starting circa 480 C.E. [[Alchon Huns|Alchon Hun]] armies began attacking the declining empire from multiple sides. Defence of the vast empire put a strain on the royal treasury. Though the Huns were initially driven out, the protracted invasions quickened the downfall of the Gupta kings. It may be noted that Indian archeologist Shanker Sharma has argued that the empire's end was precipitated by a massive deluge around the middle of the sixth century C.E.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raj |first1=Dev |title=Deluge drowned mighty Guptas: Study |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/deluge-drowned-mighty-guptas-study/cid/1685500 |website=www.telegraphindia.com |accessdate=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nNear the end of the sixth century, the empire was ruled over by a feeble ruler belonging to the [[Later Gupta dynasty]], Mahasenagupta (r. c. 562-601 C.E.).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> The [[Gupta_Empire#Decline_of_the_empire|decline of the Gupta empire]] had left the disintegrating empire in chaos. Numerous local kings and rulers like [[Yashodharman]] emerged, and started vying for control of the many pieces of the former empire. Shashanka emerged as one of these ambitious local rulers, aiming to seize control of Gauda and its surrounding region. \n\n[[File:Rohtasgarh Fort Inside Side View.jpg|thumb|The Rohtasgarh Fort, built circa 7th century]]\nThe first mention of Shashanka is found in the 7th century hill fort [[Rohtas Fort|Rohtasgarh]] in the small town of Rohtas in the kingdom of Magadha. The seal bore a curt inscription, \"Mahasamanta Shashankadeva.\" \n\nSome historians believe that Shashanka began his career as a feudatory chief (maha [[samanta]]) under Mahasenagupta, of the [[Later_Gupta_dynasty|Later Gupta Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=N.

Other historians like Sailendra Nath Sen is of the opinion that Mahasenagupta - already under pressure from the Maukharis (for failing to provide adequate protection) - wouldn't have knowingly appointed Shashanka to such an important position. Middleton (2015) argues in a similar vein that Shashanka served as ''maha samanta'' to a Gauda king, possibly Jayanaga.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=World Monarchies and Dynasties |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317451587 |page=330 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=R63ACQAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>   \n\nWhether Shashanka was a feudatory under the Maukharis or the Guptas is not known. By 605 C.E. following Mahasenagupta's death, Shashanka had established what became known as the [[Gauda Kingdom]]. From there, he issued gold coins to celebrate his triumph, and came to be addressed as ''Maharajadhiraja'' (king of great kings).\n\n== Military campaigns and warfare ==\nNot many historical references to the Gauda Army are available. Like its predecessor, the Late Gupta army, Shashanka's army had infantry and cavalry units. D. C.

The Varman king died early in the war, and his two sons stepped up.

They supposedly returned to their kingdom as feudatories under Shashanka. The younger of the two would soon turn against the Gauda.\n\n=== Campaign against the Maukharis of Kanyakubja (Kanauj) ===\nHans Bakker argues that the army that set out to attack the Maukharis in Kanyakubja was more of a \"confederation of all those who held a grudge\", and that it was led by Shashanka.<ref name=\"Bakker_Skandapurana\" />\n\nNow because the ruling dynasties of Kanyakubja and Sthaniswara were related by matrimony, Thanesar king [[Rajyavardhana]] immediately set out with 10,000 cavalrymen to recapture Kanyakubja and avenge his sister Rajyashri. Rajyavardhana fought and killed Devagupta on the way. As he continued towards Kanyakubja, he came across Shashanka's army. Circa 606 C.E. Rajyavardhana was killed by Shashanka. No conclusive evidence exists but it is possible that Shashanka, who joined the battle as an ally of [[Devagupta]], murdered him. The only source available in this matter is the ''[[Harshacharita]]'' by [[B\u0101\u1e47abha\u1e6d\u1e6da]], who was a childhood friend and constant companion of [[Harsha]]; neither of these men were present at the death.\n\n=== War with [[Harsha]] of Sthanisvara (Thanesar) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nHarsha succeeded his brother as ruler of Thanesar in 606 C.E. and he once again gathered the army and attacked Kannauj. Shashanka and his allies fought a major war with the then emperor of [[Thanesar]], [[Harsha]], and his allies. It is evident that Shashanka had to retreat from Kannauj. The result of the battle was inconclusive as Shashanka is documented to have retained dominion over his lands. Shashanka continued to rule Gauda with frequent attacks from Harsha, which he is known to have faced bravely.\n\n== Extent of kingdom ==\n\nShashanka first established himself in [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]], and set his eyes on Magadha. Magadha at that time was under Maukhari rule, and Shashanka vowed to free it again. \n\nSen (1977) has shown that none other than Shashanka could have defeated the [[Maukhari dynasty|Maukhari]] rulers of Magadha.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Bindeshwari Prasad |title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D. |date=1977 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=India |pages=129\u2013131 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> Next,\nhe focused on extending his kingdom to [[Odissi|Odissa]], parts of Central Provinces, and Bihar. \n\nThough Shashanka remains known, and referred to, as the Lord of [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]], his kingdom included more than just that region. By the end of his reign, his domain stretched from [[Vanga (Bengal)|Vanga]] to [[Bhubaneswar|Bhuvanesha]] while in the east, his kingdom bordered [[Kamarupa]].\n\n=== Peak of Gauda Kingdom's expansion ===\nAt its peak, Shashanka's kingdom and conquests included the following small kingdoms, provinces, principalities and feudatory estates (in alphabetical order):<ref name=\"History_UK\" /> \n* Chandradwipa (southern Bangladesh) \n* Dandabhukti (southern West Bengal) \n* Gauda (parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh) \n* Harikela (north-eastern Bangladesh) \n* Kamrupa (Assam)\n* Karna Subarna (part of West Bengal) \n* Lukhnauti (North Bengal and Bihar) \n* Navyabakashika (central and southern Bangladesh) \n* Pundra Vardhana (now northern Bangladesh) \n* Rarh (southern areas of West Bengal) \n* Samatata (eastern Bangladesh)\n* Subarnabithi (central Bangladesh)\n* Summha Desa (south-western West Bengal) \n* Vanga (central Bangladesh)\n* Vangala (southern Bangladesh) \n* Varendra (northern Bangladesh)\n\nWhether all of the above came into the folds of the kingdom during Shashanka's lifetime, is not known. Also, while Shashanka is known to have occupied both Kamrupa and Kanyakubja, he could/did not hold on to either for long.

However Gauda was soon divided amongst [[Harsha]] and [[Bhaskaravarman]] of [[Kamarupa]], the latter even managing to conquer [[Karnasuvarna]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nSasanka was the first fully sovereign ruler of Bengal, and he occupies a prominent place in its history and collective memory.<ref name=\"History_UK\" /> Shashanka's legacy is closely related to that of the kingdom that he founded, and the kingdom that rose and fell with him. But its legacy continued, leading later kings and sultans to accept Gauda's political demarcation.

Many historians and commentators argue that Shashanka was the first independent king of not only Gauda, but of Bengal. As such he is a symbolic figure in the region's aspirations for independence and self-rule.\n\nShashanka's feat in bringing the many tribes and kingdoms under a single flag becomes clear only after his death. Chaos broke out in Bengal with the demise of the Gauda Kingdom. In Pala inscriptions, this time is called Matsyanyayam, implying times of 'jungle rule' when big fish swallow up small fish.<ref>{{cite web |title=Matsyanyayam |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Matsyanyayam |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> \n   \nIt is thought that the development of the [[Bengali calendar]] took place under Shashanka's reign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shashanka|title=Shashanka|website=Banglapedia|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/dynasty/shashanakadynasty.html|title=Shashanka Dynasty|website=indianmirror.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V0GEtXp-GsUC&pg=PA104&dq=king+shashanka#v=onepage|title= A History of India|year = 1998|isbn=0203443454}}</ref>\n\n== In folk and popular culture ==\n\n=== Sarasanka Dighi (folk legend) ===\nSituated in present day [[Midnapore]], Sarasanka is a massive ''dighi'' (manmade lake) measuring over 140 acres.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maity |first1=Atanunandan |title=A Note on Sarasanka Dighi |url=http://www.chitrolekha.com/V4/n1/07_Sarasanka_Dantan_Medinipur.pdf |website=Chitrolekha International Magazine on Art and Design |accessdate=16 September 2019 |ref=sarasanka}}</ref> That is nearly equal to the total area of 80 football fields.

The villagers replied that they suffered from an acute shortage of water. \n\nSo Shashank's mother urged her son to do something for the villagers, so that they still had water during the lean season. Not one to disobey his mother's wishes, Shashanka reportedly pulled out an arrow from his sheath, and announced that he would excavate a reservoir as long as the arrow's trajectory. And thus, over a period of three years, and with help from local nobles, Sarasanka came into existence. \n\n=== Shashanka (fiction) ===\nPublished in 1914, Shashanka is a historical novel penned by the famous Indian archaeologist [[R._D._Banerji|Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay]], who is best known for his discoveries in [[Mohenjo Daro]]. Commentators have claimed that Bandyopadhyay was frustrated with the lack of historical and archaeological resources in Bengal.
