The film stars [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Kajol]], with [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]], [[Kirron Kher]] and [[Sharat Saxena]] in supporting roles.\n\nKhan plays the role of a tourist guide in [[New Delhi]] named Rehan Khan, while Kajol plays a blind [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] woman, Zooni Ali Beg. Both fall in love, but are separated by a [[terrorist attack]] that reportedly kills Rehan. It is later revealed that he was not killed, but is in fact a [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmiri insurgent]] whose real name is Rehan Qadri, and is the mastermind behind the attacks. Seven years later, his organization, known as the \"IKF\", sends him on a mission in [[Kashmir]], where he once again, in a strange fate, meets Zooni.\n\n''Fanaa'' was [[List of most expensive Indian films|one of the most expensive Bollywood films]] during its time of release. The film's title is derived from the [[Islam]]ic [[Sufism|Sufi]] term \"[[Fanaa (Sufism)|fanaa]]\", meaning \"destroyed\" in [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], and [[Hindi]]. Khan and Kajol were put into a romantic pairing for the first time with this film. It also marked the comeback of Kajol, who was last seen in ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001).\n\n''Fanaa'' was released on 26 May 2006. The film was banned in the state of [[Gujarat]] due to protests against Aamir Khan for his comments criticising the [[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat government]]. Nevertheless, ''Fanaa'' received positive reviews and became a commercial success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/aamir-khan-enters-brazil-with-fanaa/story-mAY8gThpbCzriIFzn8BnGJ.html|title=Aamir Khan enters Brazil with Fanaa|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Plot==\nZooni Ali Beg ([[Kajol]]) is a blind [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] woman who travels for the first time with her friends, Mehbooba ([[Sanaya Irani]]), Rubina ([[Gautami Kapoor]]) and Fatimah ([[Shruti Seth]]) to [[New Delhi]] to perform in a ceremony for [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]]. On her journey, she meets Rehan Khan ([[Aamir Khan]]), a tour guide who flirts with her. Although her friends warn Zooni about him, she falls in love. On her last night in Delhi, Rehan and Zooni spend the night together and end up in bed. As Zooni is leaving the next day, Rehan comes and takes her away with him. Her parents arrive in Delhi to marry them. Zooni has a procedure done that helps her see again, but when she comes out of surgery, she finds out that Rehan was killed in a bomb blast in the city.\n\nMalini Tyagi ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) is a special intelligence agent brought in to assess the threat of the bomb blast, and the group responsible, an independent organization fighting for an independent Kashmir known as IKF. It is revealed that Rehan is the man who placed the bomb blast in motion, then faked his death so Zooni wouldn't come looking for him. He admits that he loves Zooni, but also concedes that he can never see her again because of his dangerous life.\n\nSeven years later, Rehan is on another mission for the IKF. IKF has acquired a nuclear weapon but needs to get hold of the trigger, which is in the army's possession. Rehan steals it, but Tyagi has figured out his plan and sends forces to stop him. In the ensuing shootout, Rehan is injured. He makes his way to a remote house for help. It turns out to be Zooni's house. Zooni had become pregnant after Rehan's supposed death and has given birth to and raised her and Rehan's son. Zooni and her father save Rehan, though neither knows his real identity. Though initially distant from them, Rehan develops an affection for his son and the family.\n\nRehan eventually reveals his true identity to them. Initially hurt, Zooni refuses to let Rehan leave her again, and the two of them are married by her father. Tyagi has a report published about Rehan, warning the public that he is a [[terrorist]]. Zooni's father sees this report and confronts Rehan. Rehan accidentally throws Zooni's father off a ledge, killing him. He radios the IKF from an army officer's house but kills the officer when he discovers Rehan.\n\nZooni finds her father's body, and Rehan lies about his death. However, Zooni later sees the news report, and finds the trigger. She takes her son and flees to the officer's house, where she radios for help. Tyagi tells her to stop Rehan. Rehan arrives the next day, and takes the trigger from Zooni, saying the IKF will kill her and their son if he doesn't. Zooni shoots him in the leg. Rehan draws his gun on her, but can't bring himself to shoot. Zooni shoots him again, this time fatally, to stop him. Tyagi stops the IKF from shooting Zooni. Rehan dies in Zooni's arms.\n\nZooni and her son later visit the graves of her father and Rehan, who are buried next to each other.

The film stars [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Kajol]], with [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]], [[Kirron Kher]] and [[Sharat Saxena]] in supporting roles.\n\nKhan plays the role of a tourist guide in [[New Delhi]] named Rehan Khan, while Kajol plays a blind [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] woman, Zooni Ali Beg. Both fall in love, but are separated by a [[terrorist attack]] that reportedly kills Rehan. It is later revealed that he was not killed, but is in fact a [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmiri insurgent]] whose real name is Rehan Qadri, and is the mastermind behind the attacks. Seven years later, his organization, known as the \"IKF\", sends him on a mission in [[Kashmir]], where he once again, in a strange fate, meets Zooni.\n\n''Fanaa'' was [[List of most expensive Indian films|one of the most expensive Bollywood films]] during its time of release. The film's title is derived from the [[Islam]]ic [[Sufism|Sufi]] term \"[[Fanaa (Sufism)|fanaa]]\", meaning \"destroyed\" in [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], and [[Hindi]]. Khan and Kajol were put into a romantic pairing for the first time with this film. It also marked the comeback of Kajol, who was last seen in ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001).\n\n''Fanaa'' was released on 26 May 2006. The film was banned in the state of [[Gujarat]] due to protests against Aamir Khan for his comments criticising the [[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat government]]. Nevertheless, ''Fanaa'' received positive reviews and became a commercial success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/aamir-khan-enters-brazil-with-fanaa/story-mAY8gThpbCzriIFzn8BnGJ.html|title=Aamir Khan enters Brazil with Fanaa|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Plot==\nZooni Ali Beg ([[Kajol]]) is a blind [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] woman who travels for the first time with her friends, Mehbooba ([[Sanaya Irani]]), Rubina ([[Gautami Kapoor]]) and Fatimah ([[Shruti Seth]]) to [[New Delhi]] to perform in a ceremony for [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]]. On her journey, she meets Rehan Khan ([[Aamir Khan]]), a tour guide who flirts with her. Although her friends warn Zooni about him, she falls in love. On her last night in Delhi, Rehan and Zooni spend the night together and end up in bed. As Zooni is leaving the next day, Rehan comes and takes her away with him. Her parents arrive in Delhi to marry them. Zooni has a procedure done that helps her see again, but when she comes out of surgery, she finds out that Rehan was killed in a bomb blast in the city.\n\nMalini Tyagi ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) is a special intelligence agent brought in to assess the threat of the bomb blast, and the group responsible, an independent organization fighting for an independent Kashmir known as IKF. It is revealed that Rehan is the man who placed the bomb blast in motion, then faked his death so Zooni wouldn't come looking for him. He admits that he loves Zooni, but also concedes that he can never see her again because of his dangerous life.\n\nSeven years later, Rehan is on another mission for the IKF. IKF has acquired a nuclear weapon but needs to get hold of the trigger, which is in the army's possession. Rehan steals it, but Tyagi has figured out his plan and sends forces to stop him. In the ensuing shootout, Rehan is injured. He makes his way to a remote house for help. It turns out to be Zooni's house. Zooni had become pregnant after Rehan's supposed death and has given birth to and raised her and Rehan's son. Zooni and her father save Rehan, though neither knows his real identity. Though initially distant from them, Rehan develops an affection for his son and the family.\n\nRehan eventually reveals his true identity to them. Initially hurt, Zooni refuses to let Rehan leave her again, and the two of them are married by her father. Tyagi has a report published about Rehan, warning the public that he is a [[terrorist]]. Zooni's father sees this report and confronts Rehan. Rehan accidentally throws Zooni's father off a ledge, killing him. He radios the IKF from an army officer's house but kills the officer when he discovers Rehan.\n\nZooni finds her father's body, and Rehan lies about his death. However, Zooni later sees the news report, and finds the trigger. She takes her son and flees to the officer's house, where she radios for help. Tyagi tells her to stop Rehan. Rehan arrives the next day, and takes the trigger from Zooni, saying the IKF will kill her and their son if he doesn't. Zooni shoots him in the leg. Rehan draws his gun on her, but can't bring himself to shoot. Zooni shoots him again, this time fatally, to stop him. Tyagi stops the IKF from shooting Zooni. Rehan dies in Zooni's arms.\n\nZooni and her son later visit the graves of her father and Rehan, who are buried next to each other. When her son asks if his father was wrong, Zooni tells him that his father did what he thought was right.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Rehan Qadri Sr. / Khan\n* [[Kajol]] as Zooni Ali Beg / Zooni Rehan Qadri \n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Zulfikar Ali Beg\n* [[Kirron Kher]] as Nafisa Ali Beg\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Malini Tyagi (Anti Terrorist Special Force)\n* [[Sanaya Irani]] as Mehbooba 'Boboo'\n* [[Gautami Kapoor]] as Rubina 'Ruby'\n* [[Shruti Seth]] as Fatimah 'Fatty'\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] as Susheel Rawat (Anti Terrorist Special Force)\n* Ahmed Khan as Naana Jaan (Rehan's Grandfather)\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Colonel Maan Singh        \n* Puneet Vasishtha as Captain Ijaz Khan\n* [[Jaspal Bhatti]] as Jolly Singh\n* [[Lilette Dubey]] as Helen\n* [[Vrajesh Hirjee]] as Balwant (Tourist Guide)\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as Venkateshwar Atti Cooper Rao\n* Shishir Sharma as Defence Minister\n* Salim Shah as Defence Secretary\n* Deepak Saraf as Chief Minister\n* [[Ali Haji (actor)|Ali Haji]] as Rehan Qadri Jr.\n* [[Shiney Ahuja]] as Major Suraj Ahuja (Special Appearance)\n* [[Lara Dutta]] as Zeenat (Special Appearance) \n{{colend}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n{{expand section|date=December 2016|reason=Where are the review excerpts?}}\nAt [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 100% rating critical approval rating, based on seven reviews.<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1194626_fanaa Fanaa (2006)].

State of Florida, 352 So.2d 97 (1977) https://www.leagle.com/decision/1977449352so2d971410</ref> the [[Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal]] clarified that evidence of another crime cannot be introduced unless some relevancy to the trial at hand is shown by evidence. In ''Akers'', the court stated that \"if prosecutors insist on crying the wolf of the Williams Rule they might eventually find the courts hard of hearing.\" Critics of the way the Williams Rule is often used by the prosecution say that trial courts fail to require the requisite showing of relevance to the current issues before allowing the Williams Rule evidence to be introduced. As such, these critics claim that the evidence is in fact being used to show the bad character and criminal propensity of the defendant. Such a use is prohibited by the rules of evidence.\n\n[[Category:Florida law]]\n[[Category:United States state evidence case law]]\n[[Category:Law articles needing an infobox]]\n{{US-case-law-stub}}\n", "text_old": "The '''Williams Rule''' is based on the holding in the [[Florida]] state case of ''[[Williams v.
