However, by the 1230s, Trier's influence near the [[Rhine]] and Lahn had strengthened enough to oust Nassau from the majority of the Archbishopric's vogtships.<ref name=\"Reuling\" /> The Archbishop had reinforced Montabaur around 1217 in order to protect his possessions on the right bank of the Rhine from Nassau.\n\nIn 1224, Henry found support from [[Engelbert II of Berg|Engelbert II]], the Archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]], who made Henry his ''[[Hofmarschall]]'' and ''Schenk'' (an honorary title that originally meant \"[[cup-bearer]]\").<ref name=\"Thiele\" />  However, in exchange for his protection from the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, Henry had to cede half of [[Siegen]] to Cologne.

Henry continuously disputed any division of his realm with the Teutonic Order.\n\nHenry also held the Upper Vogtship over the Diocese of St. George in [[Limburg an der Lahn]] during the construction of the [[Limburg Cathedral]]. In 1239 he transferred, at the request of his vassal Friedrich vom Hain, the income of the [[Netphen]] parishes to the [[Premonstratensian]] Keppel Abbey near [[Hilchenbach]].

The Q44A was the chosen route as it serves as a subway feeder and as a connector to major hospitals. In the late 1950s, the route carried as many as 7.5 million passengers per year, but that figure decreased to 3.78 million by 1976. Union Turnpike received computerized traffic signals before other streets, but it did little to cut travel times for bus passengers. As part of the plan, it was decided that a zone express concept could be used on the Q44A without inconveniencing many passengers, while benefiting a majority of them.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book | last=Habib | first=Philip A. | title=TSM Seminar - Policy, Procedure & Practice | publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]; [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] | year=1978 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KcghAQAAIAAJ&q=Because+of+the+perceived+potential+to+attract+new+riders,+the+Transit+Authority+began+studying+this+issue+in%C2%A01974.+The+route+chosen,+Q/44A-Union+Turnpike,+had+an+ideal+combination+of+attributes.+...+that+a+zone%C2%A0express%C2%A0concept+could+be+applied+with+minimal+inconvenience+to+a+few+passengers,+and+significant+benefit+to+most.&dq=Because+of+the+perceived+potential+to+attract+new+riders,+the+Transit+Authority+began+studying+this+issue+in%C2%A01974.+The+route+chosen,+Q/44A-Union+Turnpike,+had+an+ideal+combination+of+attributes.+...+that+a+zone%C2%A0express%C2%A0concept+could+be+applied+with+minimal+inconvenience+to+a+few+passengers,+and+significant+benefit+to+most. |via=Google Books}}</ref>{{Rp|92\u201394}}\n\nLimited-stop service began on April 18, 1977 with the intent of attracting new riders to the route.<ref>\n* {{cite web|title=Express Yourself on the Q44A|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/35774233370/in/dateposted-family/|publisher = New York City Transit Authority |website = Flickr|date = April 18, 1977|accessdate = July 25, 2017}}\n* {{cite web|title=Express Yourself on the Q44A|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/35774221850/in/dateposted-family/|publisher = New York City Transit Authority |website = Flickr|date = April 18, 1977|accessdate = July 25, 2017}}\n* {{cite web|title=Express Yourself on the Q44A|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/35327512414/in/dateposted-family/|publisher = New York City Transit Authority |website = Flickr|date = April 18, 1977|accessdate = July 25, 2017}}\n</ref> Along with the [[M15 (New York City bus)|M15]], the two routes became the first to use limited service in the city.<ref name=\":1\" /> Limited-stop service would be bidirectional during the AM rush hour, and peak-direction (heading east) during the PM rush hour.

After running local to Winchester Boulevard, westbound expresses only stopped at Cloverdale Boulevard (226th Street), Springfield Boulevard, 149th Street, Main Street, and the subway.

The Q44A was the chosen route as it serves as a subway feeder and as a connector to major hospitals. In the late 1950s, the route carried as many as 7.5 million passengers per year, but that figure decreased to 3.78 million by 1976. Union Turnpike received computerized traffic signals before other streets, but it did little to cut travel times for bus passengers. As part of the plan, it was decided that a zone express concept could be used on the Q44A without inconveniencing many passengers, while benefiting a majority of them.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book | last=Habib | first=Philip A. | title=TSM Seminar - Policy, Procedure & Practice | publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]; [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] | year=1978 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=KcghAQAAIAAJ&q=Because+of+the+perceived+potential+to+attract+new+riders,+the+Transit+Authority+began+studying+this+issue+in%C2%A01974.+The+route+chosen,+Q/44A-Union+Turnpike,+had+an+ideal+combination+of+attributes.+...+that+a+zone%C2%A0express%C2%A0concept+could+be+applied+with+minimal+inconvenience+to+a+few+passengers,+and+significant+benefit+to+most.&dq=Because+of+the+perceived+potential+to+attract+new+riders,+the+Transit+Authority+began+studying+this+issue+in%C2%A01974.+The+route+chosen,+Q/44A-Union+Turnpike,+had+an+ideal+combination+of+attributes.+...+that+a+zone%C2%A0express%C2%A0concept+could+be+applied+with+minimal+inconvenience+to+a+few+passengers,+and+significant+benefit+to+most. |via=Google Books}}</ref>{{Rp|92\u201394}}\n\nLimited-stop service began on April 18, 1977 with the intent of attracting new riders to the route.<ref>\n* {{cite web|title=Express Yourself on the Q44A|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/35774233370/in/dateposted-family/|publisher = New York City Transit Authority |website = Flickr|date = April 18, 1977|accessdate = July 25, 2017}}\n* {{cite web|title=Express Yourself on the Q44A|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/35774221850/in/dateposted-family/|publisher = New York City Transit Authority |website = Flickr|date = April 18, 1977|accessdate = July 25, 2017}}\n* {{cite web|title=Express Yourself on the Q44A|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/35327512414/in/dateposted-family/|publisher = New York City Transit Authority |website = Flickr|date = April 18, 1977|accessdate = July 25, 2017}}\n</ref> Along with the [[M15 (New York City bus)|M15]], the two routes became the first to use limited service in the city.<ref name=\":1\" /> Limited-stop service would be bidirectional during the AM rush hour, and peak-direction (heading east) during the PM rush hour.

However, the Q38 did use CNG buses before, as Triboro Coach did use CNG buses, and used CNG buses until after takeover. In April 2006, an explosion at LaGuardia Depot which left several buses totaled or damaged force the MTA to take the CNG fueling station. From that point on, all LaGuardia Depot routes operated with Diesel or Hybrid buses. The Q38 is still based out of College Point, and uses CNG equipment up to this date.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n* {{commons category inline|Q38 (New York City bus)}}\n\n{{Queens bus routes}}\n\n[[Category:MTA Regional Bus routes|Q038]]\n[[Category:Bus routes in Queens, New York|038]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Bus route in Queens, New York}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{For|additional information on the current bus services|List of bus routes in Queens#Q38{{!}}List of bus routes in Queens}}\n{{Infobox bus line\n|box_width     = 300px\n|number        = {{NYC bus infobox header |title=q38}}\n|logo          = <!-- bus logo (ex: Image_name.png) -->\n|logo_width    = <!-- width of bus logo -->\n|logo_alt      = <!-- logo image alternate text (only works if logo_width is supplied) -->\n|subheader     = Eliot Avenue<br>Penelope Avenue\u221263rd Drive<br>Corona\u2212Middle Village\u2212Rego Park-Forest Hills\n|image         = File:MTA Hoffman Drive 21.jpg\n|image_width   = 300px\n|image_alt     = A bus on the Q38 lline\n|caption       = A Forest Hills-bound Q38 bus on [[Woodhaven Boulevard]] near [[Queens Boulevard]].\n|system        = [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]]\n|operator      = [[MTA Bus Company]]\n|garage        = [[Bus depots of MTA Regional Bus Operations#College Point Depot|College Point Depot]]\n|vehicle       = [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer C40LF]] [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]\n|livery        =\n|pvr           =\n|status        =\n|open          = June 17, 1934 (Q38 Penelope Avenue service)<ref name=\"LIDaily-Q38Start-Jun171934\">{{cite news|title=New Bus Line Makes First Trips Today: Links East Elmhurst and Other Points With Middle Village|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252014%2FJamaica%2520NY%2520Long%2520Island%2520Daily%2520Press%2FJamaica%2520NY%2520Long%2520Island%2520Daily%2520Press%25201934%2FJamaica%2520NY%2520Long%2520Island%2520Daily%2520Press%25201934%2520-%25203465.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F8df6d706164a47199e4a7e37b28bf514#page=1|accessdate=July 13, 2016|work=Long Island Daily Press|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|date=June 17, 1934|page=20}}</ref><ref name=ChiRailFan-NYCTRoutes/><ref name=\"LIDaily-6BusBids-Jun301934\"/><br>1940s (Q45X/Q50 Eliot Avenue service)<ref name=\"LIStar-TriboroAd-1943\" /><ref name=\"LIStar-TriboroRevisions-Sep1948\" /><ref name=\"LIStar-Q45XCurb-Sep1948\" /><br>July 3, 1960 (Combined Penelope/Eliot service)<ref name=\"1960Triboro1\" /><ref name=\"1960Triboro2\" />\n|close         =\n|predecessors  =\n|night         =\n|locale        = [[Queens]]\n|communities   = [[Rego Park, Queens|Rego Park]], [[LeFrak City]], [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], [[Corona, Queens|Corona]], [[Middle Village, Queens|Middle Village]], [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]]\n|landmarks     =\n|termini       = <!-- used when route starts and stops at a single location, overrides the start and end parameters -->\n|start         = [[Corona, Queens|Corona]]&nbsp;&ndash; Otis Avenue and Horace Harding Expressway\n|via           = Eliot Avenue, [[Metropolitan Avenue]], Penelope Avenue, 63rd Drive, 62nd Drive / 63rd Road\n|end           = [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]]&nbsp;&ndash; 62nd Drive & 108th Street\n|length        = <!--{{convert||mi|km}}-->\n|otherroutes   =\n|compete       =\n|ibus          =\n|level         =\n|level1        =\n|frequency     =\n|alt_frequency =\n|time          =\n|day           = All times except late nights<ref name=\"Q38\" />\n|timetable_link= [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025857/http://web.mta.info/busco/schedules/q038cur.pdf Q38]\n|annualpatronage = 2,352,459 (2017)<ref name=ridership>{{cite web | title=Facts and Figures | website=mta.info | date=March 9, 2016 | url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_busMTA_annual.htm | accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n|fare          = [[New York City transit fares|$2.75]] ([[MetroCard]] or coins)\n|cash          = Coins only (exact change required)\n|transfers     = Yes\n|map_link      = <!-- external link to an online map (ex: [http://www.example.com/map.html Line xx map]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) -->\n|map           = {{Q38 RDT|inline=yes}}\n|map_state     = collapsed\n|map_name      = <!-- name of the map (defaults to 'Route map') -->\n|previous_line = [[Q37 (New York City bus)|Q37]]\n|next_line     = [[Q39 (New York City bus)|Q39]]\n|notes         = <!-- anything special in small font, centered at the bottom of the infobox -->\n}}\n\nThe '''Q38''' [[bus route]] constitutes a [[public transit]] route in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], [[United States]].

The route is now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand.\n\n== Route description and service ==\nThe Q37 bus originates at Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike, where a vast majority of the riders of the Q37 transfer to the [[New York City Subway]] at the [[Kew Gardens\u2013Union Turnpike (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Kew Gardens\u2013Union Turnpike]] station. The bus turns via Kew Gardens Road, and then turns south via 80th Road, and then buses turn onto Park Lane. Buses at this point going northbound continue via Park Lane and then turn on Union Turnpike. After running via Park Lane, the Q37 turns onto Park Lane South, which is on the border of [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]] and [[Forest Park (Queens)|Forest Park]]. Then the bus turns east on [[Myrtle Avenue]], and then it turns southeast via 111th Street, and it continues to run via 111th Street until Rockaway Boulevard, passing through [[Richmond Hill, Queens|Richmond Hill]] and [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park]]. The bus route then turns into [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct Race Track]] to serve the [[Resorts World Casino New York|Resorts World Casino]]. Afterwards, the route continues onto Rockaway Boulevard before turning southeast via various local streets. The bus then turns east via 135th Avenue, and then the bus turns onto South Conduit Avenue before reaching the route's terminal at 149th Avenue and 150th Avenue in [[South Ozone Park, Queens|South Ozone Park]].<ref name=Q37 /><ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\">{{Cite NYC bus map|Q}}</ref>\n\nDuring weekdays, some buses bypass the Resorts World Casino.

The Q37 was formerly privately operated by [[Green Bus Lines]], under a subsidized franchise with the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (NYCDOT). The route is now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand.\n\n== Route description and service ==\nThe Q37 bus originates at Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike, where a vast majority of the riders of the Q37 transfer to the [[New York City Subway]] at the [[Kew Gardens\u2013Union Turnpike (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Kew Gardens\u2013Union Turnpike]] station. The bus turns via Kew Gardens Road, and then turns south via 80th Road, and then buses turn onto Park Lane. Buses at this point going northbound continue via Park Lane and then turn on Union Turnpike. After running via Park Lane, the Q37 turns onto Park Lane South, which is on the border of [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]] and [[Forest Park (Queens)|Forest Park]]. Then the bus turns east on [[Myrtle Avenue]], and then it turns southeast via 111th Street, and it continues to run via 111th Street until Rockaway Boulevard, passing through [[Richmond Hill, Queens|Richmond Hill]] and [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park]]. The bus route then turns into [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct Race Track]] to serve the [[Resorts World Casino New York|Resorts World Casino]]. Afterwards, the route continues onto Rockaway Boulevard before turning southeast via various local streets. The bus then turns east via 135th Avenue, and then the bus turns onto South Conduit Avenue before reaching the route's terminal at 149th Avenue and 150th Avenue in [[South Ozone Park, Queens|South Ozone Park]].<ref name=Q37 /><ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\">{{Cite NYC bus map|Q}}</ref>\n\nDuring weekdays, some buses bypass the Resorts World Casino.

With the new zone setup, one company would be awarded the franchise in each zone, with any remaining smaller operations acquired by the larger company. The Q37 fell into Zone C, the zone for [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park]], [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]], [[Richmond Hill, Queens|Richmond Hill]], and the [[Rockaway, Queens|Rockaways]], and the route was awarded to Green Bus Lines.<ref name=\"ChiRailFan-NYCTRoutes2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagorailfan.com/nycdateq.html|title=NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT ROUTES|website=www.chicagorailfan.com|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"BklynEagle-QnsBusFranchise-Sept1936\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/52705553/?terms=queens%2Bbus%2Bzone|title=Bus Franchises For Queens Are Granted by City: 12-Year Old Problem Is Solved by Action of Board of Estimate|date=September 24, 1936|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|newspaper=[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252023%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%25201935-1936%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%25201935-1936%2520-%25200819.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F8c89521611117b575f39e5224c6da1e0#page=1|title=Local Bus Route Taken Over by New Operator: First Green Line Buses Run Sunday Morning: Have 2 Other Local Runs|last=|first=|date=November 19, 1936|work=|newspaper=The Leader-Observer|access-date=June 20, 2016|via=Fulton History}}</ref>\n\nOn May 19, 1938, the New York State Transit Commission approved a modification in the Q37's route, creating a terminal loop at its Jamaica Avenue terminus instead of having the route make a [[U-turn]] on 111th Street.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3003287;view=1up;seq=181|title=Eighteenth Annual Report For the Calendar Year 1938|last=|first=|publisher=Department of Public Service Metropolitan Division Transit Commission|year=1939|isbn=|location=|pages=169-170}}</ref>\n\nOn April 15, 1941, the president and treasurer of Green Bus Lines applied for a franchise to extend the Q37 from the south side of [[Jamaica Avenue]] north to [[Queens Boulevard]] in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]], providing a connection to the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|Queens Boulevard subway line]].

Additionally, 132nd Street is a narrow residential block.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/ServChanges_Q37_Q10_QM18.htm|title=Route Adjustment and Bus Stop Change in South Ozone Park|date=February 2013|website=web.mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|language=en|access-date=July 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/south/mta-changes-routes-for-three-area-buses/article_223eb970-7a03-11e2-abfe-0019bb2963f4.html|title=MTA changes routes for three area buses|website=Queens Chronicle|access-date=June 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn September 3, 2017, due to low ridership at Resorts World Casino, half of all weekday buses started bypassing the casino and were labeled Q37B.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/36139961683/|title=Q37 Relabeled Q37B buses bypass Resorts World Casino in South Ozone Park|last=|first=|date=August 31, 2017|work=Flickr|access-date=October 27, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref> In July 2018, the MTA indicated that it would truncate the southern terminus of the Q37 bus to 131st Street and 135th Road.

Some differ only in subtle morphological features, such as details of the male genitalia. Males of some species differ confusingly from the females, being covered in greenish-yellow fur. The confusion of species arises particularly in the [[common names]]; in [[India]], for example, the common name for any all-black species of ''Xylocopa'' is ''bhanvra'' (or ''bhomora'' - \u09ad\u09cb\u09ae\u09cb\u09f0\u09be - in [[Assamese language|Assamese]]), and reports and sightings of ''bhanvra'' or ''bhomora'' are commonly misattributed to a European species, ''[[Xylocopa violacea]]''; however, this species is found only in the northern regions of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], and most reports of ''bhanvra'', especially elsewhere in India, refer to any of roughly 15 other common black ''Xylocopa'' species in the region, such as ''[[Xylocopa nasalis|X. nasalis]]'', ''[[Xylocopa tenuiscapa|X. tenuiscapa]]'', or ''[[Xylocopa tranquebarorum|X. tranquebarorum]]''.<ref>Gupta, R.K., Yanega, D. 2003.

The front wing has small stigma. When closed, the bee's short mandibles conceal the [[labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]]. The [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]] is flat.<ref name=\"DiscoverLife\"/> Males of many species have much larger eyes than the females, which relates to their mating behavior.\n\nIn the [[United States]], two eastern species, ''[[Xylocopa virginica]]'' and ''[[Xylocopa micans|X. micans]]'', occur. Three more species are primarily western in distribution, ''[[Xylocopa sonorina|X. sonorina]]'', ''[[Xylocopa tabaniformis|X. tabaniformis orpifex]]'', and ''[[Xylocopa californica|X. californica]]''.

They use wood bits to form partitions between the cells in the nest. A few species bore holes in wood dwellings. Since the tunnels are near the surface, structural damage is generally minor or superficial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Susan|title=Fact Sheet Carpenter Bees|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2074.html|publisher=Ohio State University Extension|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> However, carpenter bee nests are attractive to [[woodpecker]]s, which may do further damage by drilling into the wood to feed on the bees or larvae.{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\nCarpenter bees have short mouthparts and are important [[pollinator]]s on some open-faced or shallow flowers; for some they even are obligate pollinators, for example the maypop (''[[Passiflora incarnata]]'') and ''[[Orphium]]'', which are not pollinated by any other insects. They also are important pollinators of flowers with various forms of lids, such as ''[[Salvia]]'' species and some members of the [[Fabaceae]]. However many carpenter bees \"[[nectar robbing|rob]]\" [[nectar]] by slitting the sides of flowers with deep [[Corolla (flower)|corollae]].  ''[[Eastern carpenter bee|Xylocopa virginica]]'' is one example of a species with such [[nectar robbing]] behavior.  With their short labia the bees cannot reach the nectar without piercing the long-tubed flowers; they miss contact with the anthers and perform no pollination. In some plants, this reduces fruit and seed production, while others have developed defence mechanisms against nectar robbing. When foraging for pollen from some species with tubular flowers however, the same species of carpenter bees still achieve pollination, if the anthers and stigmata are exposed together.<ref>\"Large Carpenter Bees as Agricultural Pollinators\". www.hindawi.com. Retrieved 2015-10-01.</ref>\n \nMany [[Old World]] carpenter bees have a special pouch-like structure on the inside of their first [[metasoma]]l [[tergite]] called the [[acarinarium]] where certain [[mite]]s (''[[Dinogamasus]]'' species) reside as [[commensalism|commensals]]. The exact nature of the relationship is not fully understood, though in other bees that carry mites, they are beneficial, feeding either on [[fungi]] in the nest, or on other harmful mites.\n\n== Behavior ==\n[[File:Carpenter bee.jpg|thumb|''[[Xylocopa virginica]]'' in the United States]]\n[[File:Marvels of insect life; a popular account of structure and habit (1916) (14593767158).jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the brood chambers of ''[[Xylocopa violacea|X. violacea]]'', illustrated by Theo Carreras. Tunnels are excavated in wooden posts, divided into chambers which are provisioned, and an egg is laid in each.

The [[pupa]] (lower left) is seen from back and front.<ref>Marvels of insect life; a popular account of structure and habit, 1916, Edward Step, p. 39</ref>]]\n\nCarpenter bees are traditionally considered solitary bees, though some species have simple social nests in which mothers and daughters may cohabit. Examples of this type of social nesting can be seen in the species ''[[Xylocopa sulcatipes]]''<ref name= Comparative>Gerling, Dan; Hurd, Paul David; Hefetz, Abraham (1983).

In this type of nesting, multiple females either share in the foraging and nest laying, or one female does all the foraging and nest laying, while the other females guard.<ref name=Comparative/>\n\nSolitary species differ from social species. Solitary bees tend to be gregarious and often several nests of solitary bees are near each other. In solitary nesting, the founding bee forages, builds cells, lays the eggs, and guards. Normally, only one generation of bees live in the nest.<ref name= Comparative/> ''[[Xylocopa pubescens]]'' is one carpenter bee species that can have both social and solitary nests.<ref name=\"everything\">Gerling, Dan, Paul David Hurd, and Abraham Hefetz.

Smithsonian Institution Press, 1983.</ref>\n\nCarpenter bees make nests by tunneling into wood, bamboo, and similar hard plant material such as [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]], usually dead. They vibrate their bodies as they rasp their [[mandible (arthropod)|mandible]]s against hard wood, each nest having a single entrance which may have many adjacent tunnels. As a subfamily, they attack a wide range of host plants, but any one species may show definite adaptations or preferences for particular groups of plants. The entrance is often a perfectly circular hole measuring about {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on}} on the underside of a beam, bench, or tree limb. Carpenter bees do not eat wood. They discard the bits of wood, or reuse particles to build partitions between cells. The tunnel functions as a nursery for brood and storage for the pollen/nectar upon which the brood subsists. The provision masses of some species are among the most complex in shape of any group of bees; whereas most bees fill their brood cells with a soupy mass and others form simple [[spheroid]]al pollen masses, ''Xylocopa'' species form elongated and carefully sculpted masses that have several projections which keep the bulk of the mass from coming into contact with the cell walls, sometimes resembling an irregular [[caltrop]]. The eggs are very large relative to the size of the female, and are some of the largest eggs among all insects.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter 40 \u2014 Largest Eggs |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_40.shtml |author=Salvatore Vicidomini |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |date=February 9, 2005 |work=Book of Insect Records}}</ref> Carpenter bees can be timber pests, and cause substantial damage to wood if infestations go undetected for several years.<ref name=\"ZabelMorrell2012\">{{cite book|author1=Robert A.

Species in which the males have large eyes are characterized by a mating system where the males either search for females by patrolling, or by hovering and waiting for passing females, which they then pursue. In the other mating system, the males often have very small heads, but a large, hypertrophied [[gland]]ular reservoir in the [[mesosoma]] releases [[pheromone]]s into the airstream behind the male while it flies or hovers. The pheromone advertises the presence of the male to females.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Minckley, R. L. |author2=Buchmann, S. L. |author3=Wcislo, W.

Some differ only in subtle morphological features, such as details of the male genitalia. Males of some species differ confusingly from the females, being covered in greenish-yellow fur. The confusion of species arises particularly in the [[common names]]; in [[India]], for example, the common name for any all-black species of ''Xylocopa'' is ''bhanvra'' (or ''bhomora'' - \u09ad\u09cb\u09ae\u09cb\u09f0\u09be - in [[Assamese language|Assamese]]), and reports and sightings of ''bhanvra'' or ''bhomora'' are commonly misattributed to a European species, ''[[Xylocopa violacea]]''; however, this species is found only in the northern regions of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], and most reports of ''bhanvra'', especially elsewhere in India, refer to any of roughly 15 other common black ''Xylocopa'' species in the region, such as ''[[Xylocopa nasalis|X. nasalis]]'', ''[[Xylocopa tenuiscapa|X. tenuiscapa]]'', or ''[[Xylocopa tranquebarorum|X. tranquebarorum]]''.<ref>Gupta, R.K., Yanega, D. 2003.

Males of some species of carpenter bees have a white or yellow face, unlike bumblebees, while females lack the bare [[Pollen basket|corbicula]] of bumblebees; the hind leg is entirely hairy.\n\nThe wing venation is characteristic; the marginal cell in the front wing is narrow and elongated, and its apex bends away from the [[costa (entomology)|costa]]. The front wing has small stigma. When closed, the bee's short mandibles conceal the [[labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]]. The [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]] is flat.<ref name=\"DiscoverLife\"/> Males of many species have much larger eyes than the females, which relates to their mating behavior.\n\nIn the [[United States]], two eastern species, ''[[Xylocopa virginica]]'' and ''[[Xylocopa micans|X. micans]]'', occur. Three more species are primarily western in distribution, ''[[Xylocopa sonorina|X. sonorina]]'', ''[[Xylocopa tabaniformis|X. tabaniformis orpifex]]'', and ''[[Xylocopa californica|X. californica]]''.

They use wood bits to form partitions between the cells in the nest. A few species bore holes in wood dwellings. Since the tunnels are near the surface, structural damage is generally minor or superficial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Susan|title=Fact Sheet Carpenter Bees|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2074.html|publisher=Ohio State University Extension|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> However, carpenter bee nests are attractive to [[woodpecker]]s, which may do further damage by drilling into the wood to feed on the bees or larvae.{{citation needed|date = July 2019}}\n\nCarpenter bees have short mouthparts and are important [[pollinator]]s on some open-faced or shallow flowers; for some they even are obligate pollinators, for example the maypop (''[[Passiflora incarnata]]'') and ''[[Orphium]]'', which are not pollinated by any other insects. They also are important pollinators of flowers with various forms of lids, such as ''[[Salvia]]'' species and some members of the [[Fabaceae]]. However many carpenter bees \"[[nectar robbing|rob]]\" [[nectar]] by slitting the sides of flowers with deep [[Corolla (flower)|corollae]].  ''[[Eastern carpenter bee|Xylocopa virginica]]'' is one example of a species with such [[nectar robbing]] behavior.  With their short labia the bees cannot reach the nectar without piercing the long-tubed flowers; they miss contact with the anthers and perform no pollination. In some plants, this reduces fruit and seed production, while others have developed defence mechanisms against nectar robbing. When foraging for pollen from some species with tubular flowers however, the same species of carpenter bees still achieve pollination, if the anthers and stigmata are exposed together.<ref>\"Large Carpenter Bees as Agricultural Pollinators\". www.hindawi.com. Retrieved 2015-10-01.</ref>\n \nMany [[Old World]] carpenter bees have a special pouch-like structure on the inside of their first [[metasoma]]l [[tergite]] called the [[acarinarium]] where certain [[mite]]s (''[[Dinogamasus]]'' species) reside as [[commensalism|commensals]]. The exact nature of the relationship is not fully understood, though in other bees that carry mites, they are beneficial, feeding either on [[fungi]] in the nest, or on other harmful mites.\n\n== Behavior ==\n[[File:Carpenter bee.jpg|thumb|''[[Xylocopa virginica]]'' in the United States]]\n[[File:Marvels of insect life; a popular account of structure and habit (1916) (14593767158).jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the brood chambers of ''[[Xylocopa violacea|X. violacea]]'', illustrated by Theo Carreras. Tunnels are excavated in wooden posts, divided into chambers which are provisioned, and an egg is laid in each. Each cell initially contains a mass of pollen with the egg, on which the grub will feed. The [[pupa]] (lower left) is seen from back and front.<ref>Marvels of insect life; a popular account of structure and habit, 1916, Edward Step, p. 39</ref>]]\n\nCarpenter bees are traditionally considered solitary bees, though some species have simple social nests in which mothers and daughters may cohabit. Examples of this type of social nesting can be seen in the species ''[[Xylocopa sulcatipes]]''<ref name= Comparative>Gerling, Dan; Hurd, Paul David; Hefetz, Abraham (1983). Comparative behavioral biology of two Middle East species of carpenter bees (''Xylocopa'' Latreille)(Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology.

In this type of nesting, multiple females either share in the foraging and nest laying, or one female does all the foraging and nest laying, while the other females guard.<ref name=Comparative/>\n\nSolitary species differ from social species. Solitary bees tend to be gregarious and often several nests of solitary bees are near each other. In solitary nesting, the founding bee forages, builds cells, lays the eggs, and guards. Normally, only one generation of bees live in the nest.<ref name= Comparative/> ''[[Xylocopa pubescens]]'' is one carpenter bee species that can have both social and solitary nests.<ref name=\"everything\">Gerling, Dan, Paul David Hurd, and Abraham Hefetz.

Smithsonian Institution Press, 1983.</ref>\n\nCarpenter bees make nests by tunneling into wood, bamboo, and similar hard plant material such as [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]], usually dead. They vibrate their bodies as they rasp their [[mandible (arthropod)|mandible]]s against hard wood, each nest having a single entrance which may have many adjacent tunnels. As a subfamily, they attack a wide range of host plants, but any one species may show definite adaptations or preferences for particular groups of plants. The entrance is often a perfectly circular hole measuring about {{convert|16|mm|abbr=on}} on the underside of a beam, bench, or tree limb. Carpenter bees do not eat wood. They discard the bits of wood, or reuse particles to build partitions between cells. The tunnel functions as a nursery for brood and storage for the pollen/nectar upon which the brood subsists. The provision masses of some species are among the most complex in shape of any group of bees; whereas most bees fill their brood cells with a soupy mass and others form simple [[spheroid]]al pollen masses, ''Xylocopa'' species form elongated and carefully sculpted masses that have several projections which keep the bulk of the mass from coming into contact with the cell walls, sometimes resembling an irregular [[caltrop]]. The eggs are very large relative to the size of the female, and are some of the largest eggs among all insects.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter 40 \u2014 Largest Eggs |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_40.shtml |author=Salvatore Vicidomini |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |date=February 9, 2005 |work=Book of Insect Records}}</ref> Carpenter bees can be timber pests, and cause substantial damage to wood if infestations go undetected for several years.<ref name=\"ZabelMorrell2012\">{{cite book|author1=Robert A.

Species in which the males have large eyes are characterized by a mating system where the males either search for females by patrolling, or by hovering and waiting for passing females, which they then pursue. In the other mating system, the males often have very small heads, but a large, hypertrophied [[gland]]ular reservoir in the [[mesosoma]] releases [[pheromone]]s into the airstream behind the male while it flies or hovers. The pheromone advertises the presence of the male to females.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Minckley, R. L. |author2=Buchmann, S. L. |author3=Wcislo, W.

Following protests over this aspect of the design in the 1990s by the NAACP ([[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]) and other groups, efforts began in the [[Georgia General Assembly]] to remove the battle flag from the state flag's design.

These efforts succeeded in January 2001 when [[List of Governors of Georgia|Georgia Governor]] [[Roy Barnes]] introduced a design that, though continuing to depict the Battle Flag, greatly reduced its prominence.\n\nThe following year, amidst dwindling demands for the return of the 1956 design (\"Battle Flag\" version) and lesser opposing demands for the continued use of the new \"Barnes'\" design, the Georgia General Assembly redesigned the flag yet again; it adopted a \"compromise\" design using the 13-star First National Flag of the Confederacy (the \"Stars and Bars\"), combined with a simplified version of [[Seal of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia's state seal]] placed within [[Betsy Ross flag|the circle of 13 stars]] on the flag's canton.\n\n[[File:Georgiaflags.svg|thumb|center|500px|Recent flags of Georgia]]\n\n==== Mississippi ====\n{{Main|Flag of Mississippi}}\n[[File:Flag of Mississippi.svg|thumb|left|[[Flag of Mississippi]]]]\n[[File:Laurel City Hall.jpg|thumb|City Hall in [[Laurel, Mississippi]] in 2012]]\nThe Confederate battle flag became a part of the flag of Mississippi in 1894.

The omission was not discovered until 1993, when a lawsuit filed by the NAACP regarding the flag was being reviewed by the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi]].

The south-to-north route runs primarily on [[Kissena Boulevard]] and [[Parsons Boulevard]], serving two major [[New York City Bus|bus]]-[[New York City Subway|subway]] hubs: [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Sutphin Boulevard\u2013Archer Avenue\u2013Jamaica]] and [[Flushing\u2013Main Street (IRT Flushing Line)#Bus service|Flushing\u2013Main Street]]. The Q25 terminates in [[College Point, Queens|College Point]], and the Q34 in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], both in northern Queens.\n\nThe Q25 and Q34 were originally operated by Queens-Nassau Transit Lines, Queens Transit Corporation, and [[Queens Surface Corporation]] from the 1930s to 2005; they are now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand.\n\n==Route description and service==\n[[File:MTA Parsons 90th Av 02.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica Station]]-bound Q34 bus on Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica.]]\nThe Q25's northern terminal is at Poppenhusen Avenue and 119th Street in College Point. The bus then travels east and south via 127th Street, Ulmer Place, and Linden Place, before it merges with the Q34 at 32nd Avenue. It then turns west onto Northern Boulevard, and then south onto [[Main Street (Queens)|Main Street]] in [[Flushing, Queens|Downtown Flushing]] (which hosts [[Chinatowns in Queens#Flushing|Flushing Chinatown]]). The route passes the [[Flushing\u2013Main Street (IRT Flushing Line)|Flushing\u2013Main Street]] terminal of the [[IRT Flushing Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}), where over a dozen bus lines terminate. The LIRR [[Port Washington Branch]] also stops here, at the [[Flushing\u2013Main Street station (LIRR)|Flushing\u2013Main Street station]]. It then turns southeast onto Kissena Boulevard, running the entire distance of the street between Main Street and Parsons Boulevard, and then turns south via Parsons Boulevard. The routes proceed south to Jamaica Avenue, then west to Sutphin Boulevard, terminating at Sutphin Boulevard and 94th Avenue underneath the [[Jamaica station]] for the LIRR and [[AirTrain JFK]]. This terminal is shared with the parallel {{NYC bus link|Q65}} route, which serves 164th Street. Between the Whitestone Expressway and Jamaica, the Q25 employs limited-stop service, making intermittent stops primarily at major intersections and points of interest. Local stops are served by the regular Q25 and the Q34.<ref name=Q25Sched /><ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\"/>\n\nThe only difference in the routes is north of Linden Place, where the Q34 diverges. The Q34 starts at 149th Street and Willets Point Boulevard in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], and then turns via Union Street. The Q34 then turns on Union Street, 28th Avenue, 28th Road, 139th Street, 31st Road, 138th Street, and 32nd Avenue, where it meets up with the Q25 at Linden Place. The Q34 does not operate during late nights or weekends.<ref name=\"Q25Sched\" /><ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\"/>\n\nThe average daily ridership for the Q25 on weekdays in 2014 was 19,567, the ridership on Saturday was 13,359 and the ridership on Sunday was 10,225.

The south-to-north route runs primarily on [[Kissena Boulevard]] and [[Parsons Boulevard]], serving two major [[New York City Bus|bus]]-[[New York City Subway|subway]] hubs: [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Sutphin Boulevard\u2013Archer Avenue\u2013Jamaica]] and [[Flushing\u2013Main Street (IRT Flushing Line)#Bus service|Flushing\u2013Main Street]]. The Q25 terminates in [[College Point, Queens|College Point]], and the Q34 in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], both in northern Queens.\n\nThe Q25 and Q34 were originally operated by Queens-Nassau Transit Lines, Queens Transit Corporation, and [[Queens Surface Corporation]] from the 1930s to 2005; they are now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand.\n\n==Route description and service==\n[[File:MTA Parsons 90th Av 02.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica Station]]-bound Q34 bus on Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica.]]\nThe Q25's northern terminal is at Poppenhusen Avenue and 119th Street in College Point. The bus then travels east and south via 127th Street, Ulmer Place, and Linden Place, before it merges with the Q34 at 32nd Avenue. It then turns west onto Northern Boulevard, and then south onto [[Main Street (Queens)|Main Street]] in [[Flushing, Queens|Downtown Flushing]] (which hosts [[Chinatowns in Queens#Flushing|Flushing Chinatown]]). The route passes the [[Flushing\u2013Main Street (IRT Flushing Line)|Flushing\u2013Main Street]] terminal of the [[IRT Flushing Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Flushing}}), where over a dozen bus lines terminate. The LIRR [[Port Washington Branch]] also stops here, at the [[Flushing\u2013Main Street station (LIRR)|Flushing\u2013Main Street station]]. It then turns southeast onto Kissena Boulevard, running the entire distance of the street between Main Street and Parsons Boulevard, and then turns south via Parsons Boulevard. The routes proceed south to Jamaica Avenue, then west to Sutphin Boulevard, terminating at Sutphin Boulevard and 94th Avenue underneath the [[Jamaica station]] for the LIRR and [[AirTrain JFK]]. This terminal is shared with the parallel {{NYC bus link|Q65}} route, which serves 164th Street. Between the Whitestone Expressway and Jamaica, the Q25 employs limited-stop service, making intermittent stops primarily at major intersections and points of interest. Local stops are served by the regular Q25 and the Q34.<ref name=Q25Sched /><ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\"/>\n\nThe only difference in the routes is north of Linden Place, where the Q34 diverges. The Q34 starts at 149th Street and Willets Point Boulevard in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], and then turns via Union Street. The Q34 then turns on Union Street, 28th Avenue, 28th Road, 139th Street, 31st Road, 138th Street, and 32nd Avenue, where it meets up with the Q25 at Linden Place. The Q34 does not operate during late nights or weekends.<ref name=\"Q25Sched\" /><ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\"/>\n\nThe average daily ridership for the Q25 on weekdays in 2014 was 19,567, the ridership on Saturday was 13,359 and the ridership on Sunday was 10,225. The average daily ridership for the Q34 in 2014 was 7,218.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current3\">{{Cite NYC bus map|Q}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-NEQnsBusStudy-Sept201522\">{{cite web|title = Northeast Queens Bus Study|url = http://www.mta.info/sites/default/files/northeast_queens_bus_study_-_final_9-28-15.pdf|publisher = [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate = December 11, 2015|date = September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"NYCDOTBusSRSRA-Ch3-20042\">{{cite web|author1 = Urbitran Associates, Inc|title = NYCDOT Bus Ridership Survey and Route Analysis Final Report: Chapter 3 Transit System Characteristics|url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/dotbusrsra_2.pdf|website = [[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher = [[New York City Department of Transportation]]|accessdate = October 16, 2015|date = May 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"NYCDOTBusSRSRA-Ch4-20042\">{{cite web|author1 = Urbitran Associates, Inc|title = NYCDOT Bus Ridership Survey and Route Analysis Final Report: Chapter 4 Operating and Financial Performance|url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/dotbusrsra_3.pdf|website = [[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher = [[New York City Department of Transportation]]|accessdate = December 20, 2015|date = May 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"NYCDOT-Bus-APPB2\">{{cite web|title = Appendix B: Route Profiles|url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/appb.pdf|website = [[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher = [[New York City Department of Transportation]]|accessdate = November 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early operation===\nQ25 service began in 1928, under the operation of the Flushing Heights Bus Company.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT ROUTES|url = http://www.chicagorailfan.com/nycdateq.html|website = www.chicagorailfan.com|accessdate = December 31, 2015}}</ref> This route was formally known as Route Q-25, Flushing-Jamaica via Parsons Boulevard Line.<ref name=\":1\" /> On May 25, 1933, [[Queens Surface Corporation#Bustitution and re-merging|Queens\u2013Nassau Transit]] received a one-year franchise for route \"Q-34\" from Flushing to College Point.<ref name=\"NYState-MetroAnnualReport-1934\">{{cite web|title=Full text of 'State of New York Department of Public Service Metropolitan Division: Fourteenth Annual Report For the Calendar Year 1934'\"|url=https://archive.org/stream/annualreport1419newy/annualreport1419newy_djvu.txt|website=[[Internet Archive|archive.org]]|publisher=[[New York State Department of Public Service]]|accessdate=March 2, 2016|date=February 14, 1935}}</ref> The route began service in April 1933.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 1931, the Board of Estimate was deciding which bus route franchises would be given to which operators.

For instance, the above-mentioned C major scale contains the tritones F\u2013B (from F to the B above it, also called '''augmented fourth''') and B\u2013F (from B to the F above it, also called '''diminished fifth''', '''semidiapente''', or '''semitritonus''').<ref>E.g., [[Jacobus Leodiensis]], ''Speculum musicae'', Liber secundus, in ''Jacobi Leodiensis Speculum musicae'', edited by Roger Bragard, Corpus Scriptorum de Musica 3/2 ([Rome]: American Institute of Musicology, 1961): 128\u201331, citations on 192\u201396, 200, and 229; Jacobus Leodiensis, ''Speculum musicae'', Liber sextus, in ''Jacobi Leodiensis Speculum musicae'', edited by Roger Bragard, Corpus Scriptorum de Musica 3/6 ([Rome]: American Institute of Musicology, 1973): 1\u2013161, citations on 52 and 68; Johannes Torkesey, ''Declaratio et expositio'', London: British Library, Lansdowne 763, ff.89v-94v, citations on f.92r,2\u20133; [[Prosdocimus de Beldemandis]], ''Tractatus musice speculative'', in D.

According to a complex but widely used [[interval (music)#Interval number and quality|naming convention]], six of them are classified as ''augmented fourths'', and the other six as ''diminished fifths''.\n\nUnder that convention, a ''fourth'' is an interval encompassing four [[staff position]]s, while a ''fifth'' encompasses five staff positions (see [[Interval (music)#Number|interval number]] for more details).\nThe augmented fourth (''A4'') and diminished fifth (''d5'') are defined as the intervals produced by [[augmentation (music)|widening]] the [[perfect fourth]] and [[Diminution|narrowing]] the [[perfect fifth]] by one [[chromatic semitone]].<ref>Bruce Benward & Marilyn Nadine Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', seventh edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill), p.&nbsp;54. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref>\nThey both span six semitones, and they are the [[Inversion (music)#Intervals|inverse]] of each other, meaning that their sum is exactly equal to one [[perfect octave]] (A4 + d5 = P8).\nIn twelve-tone equal temperament, the most commonly used [[tuning system]], the A4 is [[Enharmonic|equivalent]] to a d5, as both have the size of exactly half an [[octave]]. In most other tuning systems, they are not equivalent, and neither is exactly equal to half an octave.\n\nAny augmented fourth can be decomposed into three whole tones. For instance, the interval F\u2013B is an augmented fourth and can be decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F\u2013G, G\u2013A, and A\u2013B.\n\nIt is not possible to decompose a diminished fifth into three adjacent whole tones. The reason is that a whole tone is a [[major second]], and according to a rule explained elsewhere,{{Where|date=April 2015}}<!--formerly linked to [[Interval (music)#Simple and compound]], which discusses intervals larger than an octave, not composite intervals.--> the composition of three seconds is always a fourth (for instance, an A4). To obtain a fifth (for instance, a d5), it is necessary to add another second. For instance, using the notes of the C major scale, the diminished fifth B\u2013F can be decomposed into the four adjacent intervals\n: B\u2013C ([[minor second]]), C\u2013D (major second), D\u2013E (major second), and E\u2013F (minor second).\nUsing the notes of a chromatic scale, B\u2013F may be also decomposed into the four adjacent intervals\n: B\u2013C{{Music|sharp}} (major second), C{{Music|sharp}}\u2013D{{Music|sharp}} (major second), D{{Music|sharp}}\u2013E{{Music|sharp}} (major second), and E{{Music|sharp}}\u2013F{{Music|natural}} ([[diminished second]]).\nNotice that the latter diminished second is formed by two [[Enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] notes (E{{Music|sharp}} and F{{Music|natural}}). On a [[piano keyboard]], these notes are produced by the same key. However, in the above-mentioned naming convention, they are considered different notes, as they are written on different [[staff position]]s and have different diatonic functions within music theory.\n\n== Definitions ==\n{{section refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Tritone in the chromatic circle.png|thumb|right|Tritone drawn in the [[chromatic circle]].]]\nA tritone (abbreviation: ''TT'') is traditionally defined as a musical interval composed of three [[major second|whole tones]]. As the symbol for whole tone is ''T'', this definition may also be written as follows:\n\n: ''TT = T+T+T''\n\nOnly if the three tones are of the same size (which is not the case for many [[tuning system]]s) can this formula be simplified to:\n\n: ''TT = 3T''\n\nThis definition, however, has two different interpretations (broad and strict).\n\n=== Broad interpretation (chromatic scale) ===\nIn a [[chromatic scale]], the interval between any note and the previous or next is a semitone. Using the notes of a chromatic scale, each tone can be divided into two semitones:\n: ''T = S+S''\n\nFor instance, the tone from C to D (in short, C\u2013D) can be decomposed into the two semitones C\u2013C{{Music|sharp}} and C{{Music|sharp}}\u2013D by using the note C{{Music|sharp}}, which in a chromatic scale lies between C and D. This means that, when a chromatic scale is used, a tritone can be also defined as any musical interval spanning six semitones:\n\n: ''TT = T+T+T = S+S+S+S+S+S''.\n\nAccording to this definition, with the twelve notes of a chromatic scale it is possible to define twelve different tritones, each starting from a different note and ending six notes above it. Although all of them span six semitones, six of them are classified as ''augmented fourth''s, and the other six as ''diminished fifths''.\n\n=== Strict interpretation (diatonic scale) ===\nWithin a [[diatonic scale]], whole tones are always formed by adjacent notes (such as C and D) and therefore they are regarded as [[incomposite interval]]s. In other words, they cannot be divided into smaller intervals. Consequently, in this context the above-mentioned \"decomposition\" of the tritone into six semitones is typically not allowed.\n\nIf a diatonic scale is used, with its 7 notes it is possible to form only one sequence of three adjacent whole tones (''T+T+T''). This interval is an A4. For instance, in the [[C major]] diatonic scale (C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013...), the only tritone is from F to B. It is a tritone because F\u2013G, G\u2013A, and A\u2013B are three adjacent whole tones. It is a ''fourth'' because the notes from F to B are four (F, G, A, B). It is ''augmented'' (i.e., widened) because it is wider than most of the fourths found in the scale (they are [[perfect fourth]]s).\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the d5 is not a tritone. Indeed, in a diatonic scale, there is only one d5, and this interval does not meet the strict definition of tritone, as it is formed by one semitone, two whole tones, and another semitone:\n\n: ''d5 = S+T+T+S''.\n\nFor instance, in the C major diatonic scale, the only d5 is from B to F. It is a ''fifth'' because the notes from B to F are five (B, C, D, E, F). It is ''diminished'' (i.e. narrowed) because it is smaller than most of the fifths found in the scale (they are [[perfect fifth]]s).\n\n== Size in different tuning systems ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = Tritones\n | image1 = Just augmented fourth on C.png\n | caption1 = [[major fourth|just augmented fourth]] between C and F{{music|sharp}}+ {{Audio|Just augmented fourth on C.mid|Play 45:32 (590.22 cents)}}\n | image2 = Pythagorean augmented fourth on C.png\n | caption2 = Pythagorean augmented fourth between C and F{{music|sharp}}++ {{Audio|Pythagorean augmented fourth on C.mid|Play 729:512 (611.73 cents)}}\n | image3 = Augmented fourth on C.png\n | caption3 = the classic augmented fourth between C and F{{music|sharp}} {{Audio|Classic augmented fourth on C.mid|Play 25:18 (568.72 cents)}}\n | image4 = Diminished fifth on C.png\n | caption4 = the classic diminished fifth between C and G{{music|flat}} {{Audio|Classic diminished fifth on C.mid|Play 36:25 (631.28 cents)}}\n | image5 = Lesser septimal tritone on C.png\n | caption5 = Lesser septimal tritone on between C and G{{music|7}}{{music|b}}<ref name=\"Fonville\">Fonville, John. \"Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation- A Guide for Interpreters\", p.&nbsp;121\u201322, ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp.&nbsp;106\u201337.</ref> {{audio|Lesser septimal tritone on C.mid|Play 7:5 (582.51 cents)}}\n | image6 = Comparison of tritones.png\n | caption6 = Comparison of intervals near or enharmonic with the tritone\n}}\n\nIn twelve-tone equal temperament, the A4 is exactly half an [[octave]] (i.e., a ratio of [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]:1 or 600 [[cent (music)|cents]]; {{audio|Tritone1.mid|play}}). The inverse of 600 cents is 600 cents. Thus, in this tuning system, the A4 and its inverse (d5) are [[Enharmonic|equivalent]].\n\nThe half-octave or equal tempered A4 and d5 are unique in being equal to their own inverse (each to the other). In other [[meantone temperament|meantone]] tuning systems, besides 12-tone equal temperament, A4 and d5 are distinct intervals because neither is exactly half an octave. In any meantone tuning near to {{fraction|2|9}}-comma meantone the A4 is near to the ratio 7:5 (582.51) and the d5 to 10:7 (617.49), which is what these intervals are in [[septimal meantone temperament]]. In [[31 equal temperament]], for example, the A4 is 619.35 cents, whereas the d5 is 580.65 cents. This is perceptually indistinguishable from septimal meantone temperament.\n\nSince they are the inverse of each other, by definition A4 and d5 always add up to exactly one [[octave|perfect octave]]:\n: ''A4 + d5 = P8''.\nOn the other hand, two A4 add up to six whole tones. In equal temperament, this is equal to exactly one perfect octave:\n: ''A4 + A4 = P8''.\nIn [[quarter-comma meantone]] temperament, this is a [[diesis]] (128:125) less than a perfect octave:\n: ''A4 + A4 = P8 \u2212 [[diesis]]''.\n\nIn [[just intonation]] several different sizes can be chosen both for the A4 and the d5.

It is also present in the natural [[minor scale]] as the interval formed between the second and sixth scale degrees (for example, from D to A{{Music|flat}} in the key of [[C minor]]). The melodic minor scale, having two forms, presents a tritone in different locations when ascending and descending (when the scale ascends, the tritone appears between the third and sixth scale degrees and the fourth and seventh scale degrees, and when the scale descends, the tritone appears between the second and sixth scale degrees). [[Supertonic]] chords using the notes from the natural minor mode thus contain a tritone, regardless of inversion. Containing tritones, these scales are [[Anhemitonic scale|tritonic]].\n\n=== Occurrences in chords ===\n\nThe dominant seventh chord in root position contains a diminished fifth (tritone) within its pitch construction: it occurs between the third and seventh above the [[root (chord)|root]]. In addition, [[augmented sixth chord]]s, some of which are enharmonic to dominant seventh chords, contain tritones spelled as augmented fourths (for example, the German sixth, from A to D{{music|sharp}} in the key of [[A minor]]); the French sixth chord can be viewed as a superposition of two tritones a major second apart.\n\nThe [[diminished triad]] also contains a tritone in its construction, deriving its name from the diminished-fifth interval (i.e. a tritone). The [[half-diminished seventh chord]] contains the same tritone, while the fully [[diminished seventh chord]] is made up of two superposed tritones a minor third apart.\n\nOther chords built on these, such as [[ninth chord]]s, often include tritones (as diminished fifths).\n\n=== Resolution ===\n{{thumb|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\clef treble \\key c \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\stemUp b'2 c f e\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\clef treble \\key c \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\stemDown f2 e \\bar \"||\" b' c \\bar \"||\"\n             }\n            >>\n</score>}}\nIn all of the sonorities mentioned above, used in functional harmonic analysis, the tritone pushes towards resolution, generally resolving by [[step (music)|step]] in [[contrary motion]]. This determines the resolution of chords containing tritones.\n\nThe augmented fourth resolves outward to a minor or major sixth (the first measure below). The inversion of this, a diminished fifth, resolves inward to a major or minor third (the second measure below).

This interval was frequently avoided in medieval ecclesiastical singing because of its dissonant quality.

Later theorists such as Ugolino d'Orvieto and Tinctoris advocated for the inclusion of B{{music|flat}}.<ref>{{citation | author =Guido d'Arezzo | title = Epistola de ignoto cantu|pp=lines 309\u201322|nopp=y}}{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}<!--If a particular manuscript copy is being cited, the location, library name, and shelf number are needed; if a modern edition, then the editor, location, and publisher are needed at a minimum.-->{{Failed verification|date=October 2015}}<!--Guido does not mention Ugolino or Tinctoris, nor how could he?

However, stories that singers were [[excommunication|excommunicated]] or otherwise punished by the Church for invoking this interval are likely fanciful. At any rate, avoidance of the interval for musical reasons has a long history, stretching back to the parallel [[organum]] of the ''[[Musica Enchiriadis]]''. In all these expressions, including the commonly cited ''\"mi contra fa est diabolus in musica\"'', the \"mi\" and \"fa\" refer to notes from two adjacent [[hexachord]]s. For instance, in the tritone B\u2013F, B would be \"mi\", that is the third scale degree in the \"hard\" hexachord beginning on G, while F would be \"fa\", that is the fourth scale degree in the \"natural\" hexachord beginning on C.\n\nLater, with the rise of the Baroque and Classical music era, composers accepted the tritone, but used it in a specific, controlled way\u2014notably through the principle of the tension-release mechanism of the [[Tonality|tonal system]]. In that system (which is the fundamental musical grammar of Baroque and Classical music), the tritone is one of the defining intervals of the dominant-seventh chord and two tritones separated by a minor third give the fully diminished seventh chord its characteristic sound. In minor, the diminished triad (comprising two minor thirds, which together add up to a tritone) appears on the second scale degree\u2014and thus features prominently in the progression ii<sup>o</sup>\u2013V\u2013i. Often, the [[Inverted chord|inversion]] ii<sup>o6</sup> is used to move the tritone to the inner voices as this allows for stepwise motion in the bass to the dominant root. In three-part counterpoint, free use of the diminished triad in first inversion is permitted, as this eliminates the tritone relation to the bass.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jeppesen |first=Knud |authorlink=Knud Jeppesen |others=trans. by [[Glen Haydon]], with a new foreword by Alfred Mann |title=Counterpoint: the polyphonic vocal style of the sixteenth century |origyear=1939 |url=https://archive.org/details/counterpointpoly0000jepp |url-access=registration |year=1992 |publisher=Dover |location=New York |isbn=0-486-27036-X }}</ref>\n\nIt is only with the [[Romantic music]] and [[modern classical music]] that composers started to use it totally freely, without functional limitations notably in an expressive way to exploit the \"evil\" connotations culturally associated with it, such as [[Franz Liszt]]'s use of the tritone to suggest Hell in his ''[[Dante Sonata]]'':\n\n{{thumb|align=center|caption=Liszt, \"Apr\u00e8s une lecture du Dante\" from Ann\u00e9es de P\u00e8lerinage.|content=\n<score override_ogg=\"Liszt, apres une lecture de Dante from Annees de Pelerinage.wav\"> {\n\\relative c' { \\new PianoStaff << \\set PianoStaff.connectArpeggios = ##t\n\\new Staff { \\key f \\major \\tempo \"Andante maestoso\"\n  R1 R r2 \\clef F << { <a, c fis>2\\(\n  \\stemDown <bes des g> <ces ees aes> \\stemUp <ees ees'>2..\\) q16 s1 } \\\\\n  { \\stemNeutral s2*3 <aes bes>2\\<_\\markup\\italic{poco rit.} <g bes>\\>\n  <ees aes ces ees>1\\arpeggio\\!^\\fermata } >>\n}\n\\new Staff { \\clef F \\key f \\major\n  \\slashedGrace { <a a'>8 } <a a'>2^^ \\slashedGrace { <ees ees'>8 } <ees ees'>2^^\n  \\slashedGrace { <a, a'>8 } <a a'>4^^ \\slashedGrace { <ees ees'>8 } <ees ees'>4^^\n  \\slashedGrace { <a, a'>8 } <a a'>4^^ \\slashedGrace { <ees ees'>8 } <ees ees'>4^^~q1~q~\n  q4 <fes fes'>8.

Since the perfect 11th (i.e. an octave plus perfect fourth) is typically perceived as a dissonance requiring a resolution to a major or minor 10th, chords that expand to the 11th or beyond typically raise the 11th a semitone (thus giving us an augmented or sharp 11th, or an octave plus a tritone from the root of the chord) and present it in conjunction with the perfect 5th of the chord. Also in jazz harmony, the tritone is both part of the dominant chord and its substitute dominant (also known as the sub V chord). Because they share the same tritone, they are possible substitutes for one another. This is known as a [[tritone substitution]]. The tritone substitution is one of the most common chord and improvisation devices in jazz.\n\n{{quote|In the theory of harmony it is known that a diminished interval needs to be resolved inwards, and an augmented interval outwards. ... and with the correct resolution of the ''true'' tritones this desire is totally satisfied. However, if one plays a ''just'' diminished fifth that is perfectly in tune, for example, there is no wish to resolve it to a major third. Just the opposite\u2014aurally one wants to enlarge it to a minor sixth. The opposite holds true for the ''just'' augmented fourth. ...<br />These apparently contradictory aural experiences become understandable when the cents of both types of just tritones are compared with those of the true tritones and then read 'crossed-over'. One then notices that the just augmented fourth of 590.224 cents is only 2 cents bigger than the true diminished fifth of 588.270 cents, and that both intervals lie below the middle of the octave of 600.000 cents. It is no wonder that, following the ear, we want to resolve both downwards. The ear only desires the tritone to be resolved upwards when it is bigger than the middle of the octave. Therefore the opposite is the case with the just diminished fifth of 609.776 cents. ...<ref name=\"Renold\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of meantone intervals]]\n* [[Interval (music)|List of musical intervals]]\n* [[List of pitch intervals]]\n* [[Hexatonic scale#Tritone scale]]\n* [[Consecutive fifths#Unequal fifths]]\n* [[Petrushka chord]]\n* [[Tritonic scale]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*R., Ken (2012).

In most other tuning systems, they are not equivalent, and neither is exactly equal to half an octave.\n\nAny augmented fourth can be decomposed into three whole tones. For instance, the interval F\u2013B is an augmented fourth and can be decomposed into the three adjacent whole tones F\u2013G, G\u2013A, and A\u2013B.\n\nIt is not possible to decompose a diminished fifth into three adjacent whole tones. The reason is that a whole tone is a [[major second]], and according to a rule explained elsewhere,{{Where|date=April 2015}}<!--formerly linked to [[Interval (music)#Simple and compound]], which discusses intervals larger than an octave, not composite intervals.--> the composition of three seconds is always a fourth (for instance, an A4). To obtain a fifth (for instance, a d5), it is necessary to add another second. For instance, using the notes of the C major scale, the diminished fifth B\u2013F can be decomposed into the four adjacent intervals\n: B\u2013C ([[minor second]]), C\u2013D (major second), D\u2013E (major second), and E\u2013F (minor second).\nUsing the notes of a chromatic scale, B\u2013F may be also decomposed into the four adjacent intervals\n: B\u2013C{{Music|sharp}} (major second), C{{Music|sharp}}\u2013D{{Music|sharp}} (major second), D{{Music|sharp}}\u2013E{{Music|sharp}} (major second), and E{{Music|sharp}}\u2013F{{Music|natural}} ([[diminished second]]).\nNotice that the latter diminished second is formed by two [[Enharmonic|enharmonically equivalent]] notes (E{{Music|sharp}} and F{{Music|natural}}). On a [[piano keyboard]], these notes are produced by the same key. However, in the above-mentioned naming convention, they are considered different notes, as they are written on different [[staff position]]s and have different diatonic functions within music theory.\n\n== Definitions ==\n{{section refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Tritone in the chromatic circle.png|thumb|right|Tritone drawn in the [[chromatic circle]].]]\nA tritone (abbreviation: ''TT'') is traditionally defined as a musical interval composed of three [[major second|whole tones]]. As the symbol for whole tone is ''T'', this definition may also be written as follows:\n\n: ''TT = T+T+T''\n\nOnly if the three tones are of the same size (which is not the case for many [[tuning system]]s) can this formula be simplified to:\n\n: ''TT = 3T''\n\nThis definition, however, has two different interpretations (broad and strict).\n\n=== Broad interpretation (chromatic scale) ===\nIn a [[chromatic scale]], the interval between any note and the previous or next is a semitone. Using the notes of a chromatic scale, each tone can be divided into two semitones:\n: ''T = S+S''\n\nFor instance, the tone from C to D (in short, C\u2013D) can be decomposed into the two semitones C\u2013C{{Music|sharp}} and C{{Music|sharp}}\u2013D by using the note C{{Music|sharp}}, which in a chromatic scale lies between C and D. This means that, when a chromatic scale is used, a tritone can be also defined as any musical interval spanning six semitones:\n\n: ''TT = T+T+T = S+S+S+S+S+S''.\n\nAccording to this definition, with the twelve notes of a chromatic scale it is possible to define twelve different tritones, each starting from a different note and ending six notes above it. Although all of them span six semitones, six of them are classified as ''augmented fourth''s, and the other six as ''diminished fifths''.\n\n=== Strict interpretation (diatonic scale) ===\nWithin a [[diatonic scale]], whole tones are always formed by adjacent notes (such as C and D) and therefore they are regarded as [[incomposite interval]]s. In other words, they cannot be divided into smaller intervals. Consequently, in this context the above-mentioned \"decomposition\" of the tritone into six semitones is typically not allowed.\n\nIf a diatonic scale is used, with its 7 notes it is possible to form only one sequence of three adjacent whole tones (''T+T+T''). This interval is an A4. For instance, in the [[C major]] diatonic scale (C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013...), the only tritone is from F to B. It is a tritone because F\u2013G, G\u2013A, and A\u2013B are three adjacent whole tones. It is a ''fourth'' because the notes from F to B are four (F, G, A, B). It is ''augmented'' (i.e., widened) because it is wider than most of the fourths found in the scale (they are [[perfect fourth]]s).\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the d5 is not a tritone. Indeed, in a diatonic scale, there is only one d5, and this interval does not meet the strict definition of tritone, as it is formed by one semitone, two whole tones, and another semitone:\n\n: ''d5 = S+T+T+S''.\n\nFor instance, in the C major diatonic scale, the only d5 is from B to F. It is a ''fifth'' because the notes from B to F are five (B, C, D, E, F). It is ''diminished'' (i.e. narrowed) because it is smaller than most of the fifths found in the scale (they are [[perfect fifth]]s).\n\n== Size in different tuning systems ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = Tritones\n | image1 = Just augmented fourth on C.png\n | caption1 = [[major fourth|just augmented fourth]] between C and F{{music|sharp}}+ {{Audio|Just augmented fourth on C.mid|Play 45:32 (590.22 cents)}}\n | image2 = Pythagorean augmented fourth on C.png\n | caption2 = Pythagorean augmented fourth between C and F{{music|sharp}}++ {{Audio|Pythagorean augmented fourth on C.mid|Play 729:512 (611.73 cents)}}\n | image3 = Augmented fourth on C.png\n | caption3 = the classic augmented fourth between C and F{{music|sharp}} {{Audio|Classic augmented fourth on C.mid|Play 25:18 (568.72 cents)}}\n | image4 = Diminished fifth on C.png\n | caption4 = the classic diminished fifth between C and G{{music|flat}} {{Audio|Classic diminished fifth on C.mid|Play 36:25 (631.28 cents)}}\n | image5 = Lesser septimal tritone on C.png\n | caption5 = Lesser septimal tritone on between C and G{{music|7}}{{music|b}}<ref name=\"Fonville\">Fonville, John. \"Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation- A Guide for Interpreters\", p.&nbsp;121\u201322, ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp.&nbsp;106\u201337.</ref> {{audio|Lesser septimal tritone on C.mid|Play 7:5 (582.51 cents)}}\n | image6 = Comparison of tritones.png\n | caption6 = Comparison of intervals near or enharmonic with the tritone\n}}\n\nIn twelve-tone equal temperament, the A4 is exactly half an [[octave]] (i.e., a ratio of [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]:1 or 600 [[cent (music)|cents]]; {{audio|Tritone1.mid|play}}). The inverse of 600 cents is 600 cents. Thus, in this tuning system, the A4 and its inverse (d5) are [[Enharmonic|equivalent]].\n\nThe half-octave or equal tempered A4 and d5 are unique in being equal to their own inverse (each to the other). In other [[meantone temperament|meantone]] tuning systems, besides 12-tone equal temperament, A4 and d5 are distinct intervals because neither is exactly half an octave. In any meantone tuning near to {{fraction|2|9}}-comma meantone the A4 is near to the ratio 7:5 (582.51) and the d5 to 10:7 (617.49), which is what these intervals are in [[septimal meantone temperament]]. In [[31 equal temperament]], for example, the A4 is 619.35 cents, whereas the d5 is 580.65 cents. This is perceptually indistinguishable from septimal meantone temperament.\n\nSince they are the inverse of each other, by definition A4 and d5 always add up to exactly one [[octave|perfect octave]]:\n: ''A4 + d5 = P8''.\nOn the other hand, two A4 add up to six whole tones. In equal temperament, this is equal to exactly one perfect octave:\n: ''A4 + A4 = P8''.\nIn [[quarter-comma meantone]] temperament, this is a [[diesis]] (128:125) less than a perfect octave:\n: ''A4 + A4 = P8 \u2212 [[diesis]]''.\n\nIn [[just intonation]] several different sizes can be chosen both for the A4 and the d5.

It is also present in the natural [[minor scale]] as the interval formed between the second and sixth scale degrees (for example, from D to A{{Music|flat}} in the key of [[C minor]]). The melodic minor scale, having two forms, presents a tritone in different locations when ascending and descending (when the scale ascends, the tritone appears between the third and sixth scale degrees and the fourth and seventh scale degrees, and when the scale descends, the tritone appears between the second and sixth scale degrees). [[Supertonic]] chords using the notes from the natural minor mode thus contain a tritone, regardless of inversion. Containing tritones, these scales are [[Anhemitonic scale|tritonic]].\n\n=== Occurrences in chords ===\n\nThe dominant seventh chord in root position contains a diminished fifth (tritone) within its pitch construction: it occurs between the third and seventh above the [[root (chord)|root]]. In addition, [[augmented sixth chord]]s, some of which are enharmonic to dominant seventh chords, contain tritones spelled as augmented fourths (for example, the German sixth, from A to D{{music|sharp}} in the key of [[A minor]]); the French sixth chord can be viewed as a superposition of two tritones a major second apart.\n\nThe [[diminished triad]] also contains a tritone in its construction, deriving its name from the diminished-fifth interval (i.e. a tritone). The [[half-diminished seventh chord]] contains the same tritone, while the fully [[diminished seventh chord]] is made up of two superposed tritones a minor third apart.\n\nOther chords built on these, such as [[ninth chord]]s, often include tritones (as diminished fifths).\n\n=== Resolution ===\nIn all of the sonorities mentioned above, used in functional harmonic analysis, the tritone pushes towards resolution, generally resolving by [[step (music)|step]] in [[contrary motion]]. This determines the resolution of chords containing tritones.\n\nThe augmented fourth resolves outward to a minor or major sixth (the first measure below). The inversion of this, a diminished fifth, resolves inward to a major or minor third (the second measure below). The diminished fifth is often called a tritone in modern [[tonal music|tonal]] theory, but functionally and notationally it can only resolve inwards as a diminished fifth and is therefore not reckoned a tritone\u2014that is, an interval composed of three adjacent whole tones\u2014in mid-[[renaissance]] (early 16th-century) music theory.<ref>Margaret Bent, \"\"Accidentals, Counterpoint, and Notation in Aaron\u2019s Aggiunta to the Toscanello\", ''Journal of Musicology'' 12: \"Aspects of Musical Language and Culture in the Renaissance: A Birthday Tribute to James Haar\" (1994): 306\u201344.

This interval was frequently avoided in medieval ecclesiastical singing because of its dissonant quality. The first explicit prohibition of it seems to occur with the development of [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s [[hexachord]]al system, who suggested that rather than make B{{music|flat}} a diatonic note, the hexachord be moved and based on C to avoid the F\u2013B tritone altogether.

However, stories that singers were [[excommunication|excommunicated]] or otherwise punished by the Church for invoking this interval are likely fanciful. At any rate, avoidance of the interval for musical reasons has a long history, stretching back to the parallel [[organum]] of the ''[[Musica Enchiriadis]]''. In all these expressions, including the commonly cited ''\"mi contra fa est diabolus in musica\"'', the \"mi\" and \"fa\" refer to notes from two adjacent [[hexachord]]s. For instance, in the tritone B\u2013F, B would be \"mi\", that is the third scale degree in the \"hard\" hexachord beginning on G, while F would be \"fa\", that is the fourth scale degree in the \"natural\" hexachord beginning on C.\n\nLater, with the rise of the Baroque and Classical music era, composers accepted the tritone, but used it in a specific, controlled way\u2014notably through the principle of the tension-release mechanism of the [[Tonality|tonal system]]. In that system (which is the fundamental musical grammar of Baroque and Classical music), the tritone is one of the defining intervals of the dominant-seventh chord and two tritones separated by a minor third give the fully diminished seventh chord its characteristic sound. In minor, the diminished triad (comprising two minor thirds, which together add up to a tritone) appears on the second scale degree\u2014and thus features prominently in the progression ii<sup>o</sup>\u2013V\u2013i.

Since the perfect 11th (i.e. an octave plus perfect fourth) is typically perceived as a dissonance requiring a resolution to a major or minor 10th, chords that expand to the 11th or beyond typically raise the 11th a semitone (thus giving us an augmented or sharp 11th, or an octave plus a tritone from the root of the chord) and present it in conjunction with the perfect 5th of the chord. Also in jazz harmony, the tritone is both part of the dominant chord and its substitute dominant (also known as the sub V chord). Because they share the same tritone, they are possible substitutes for one another. This is known as a [[tritone substitution]]. The tritone substitution is one of the most common chord and improvisation devices in jazz.\n\n{{quote|In the theory of harmony it is known that a diminished interval needs to be resolved inwards, and an augmented interval outwards. ... and with the correct resolution of the ''true'' tritones this desire is totally satisfied. However, if one plays a ''just'' diminished fifth that is perfectly in tune, for example, there is no wish to resolve it to a major third. Just the opposite\u2014aurally one wants to enlarge it to a minor sixth. The opposite holds true for the ''just'' augmented fourth. ...<br />These apparently contradictory aural experiences become understandable when the cents of both types of just tritones are compared with those of the true tritones and then read 'crossed-over'. One then notices that the just augmented fourth of 590.224 cents is only 2 cents bigger than the true diminished fifth of 588.270 cents, and that both intervals lie below the middle of the octave of 600.000 cents. It is no wonder that, following the ear, we want to resolve both downwards. The ear only desires the tritone to be resolved upwards when it is bigger than the middle of the octave.

Memory deficits, age-related memory loss, and people's want to improve their own memory has lead to research on how to best help people to improve their memory. Research has also worked to determine what factors influence memory and cognition. Many different techniques to improve memory have been found, including [[cognitive training]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[stress management]], and [[exercise]]. Each technique has the ability to influence memory in a different ways. [[Neuroimaging]] has also provided [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] evidence supporting [[Holism|holistic]] ways in which one can improve memory.\n\n==Memory function factors==\n\n=== Neuroplasticity===\n[[Neuroplasticity]] is the mechanism by which the brain encodes experience, learns new behaviours and relearns lost behaviour if the brain has been damaged.<ref name=\"Kleim\">Kleim, JA., & Jones, TA.

[[London]] [[taxicab]] drivers provide a great example of this dynamic. They undergo extensive training for 2\u20134 years, learning and memorizing street names, layout of streets within the city and the quickest cross-city routes.  After studying London taxicab drivers over a period of time, it was found that the [[grey matter]] volume increased over time in the posterior [[hippocampus]], an area in the brain involved heavily in memory. The longer taxi drivers navigated the streets of London, the greater the posterior hippocampal gray matter volume.  This suggests a correlation between a healthy person's mental training or exercise and their brains capacity to manage greater volume and more complex information. The increase in volume actually led to a decrease in the taxi drivers' ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information.<ref name=\"Maguire\">Maguire, EA., Woollett, K., & Spiers, HJ. (2006).

In one experiment, the goal was to prove that cognitive training would increase the cognitive functions in older adults by using three types of training (memory, reasoning and speed of processing). It was found that improvements in cognitive ability not only was maintained over time but had a positive transfer effect on everyday functioning. Therefore, these results indicate that each type of cognitive training can produce immediate and lasting improvements in each kind of cognitive ability, thus suggesting that training can be beneficial to improving memory.<ref name=\"Willis\">Willis, SL., Tennstedt, SL., Marsiske, M., Ball, K., Elias, J., Koepke, KM., Morris, JN., Rebok, GW., Unverzagt, FW., Stoddard, AM., & Wright, E.

For example, the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) study by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] in 2009 demonstrated that cognitive training designed to improve accuracy and speed of the [[auditory system]] presented improvements in memory and attention system functioning as well as auditory functioning.<ref>Smith, G.E., Housen, P., Yaffe, K., Ruff, R., Kennison, R.F., Mahncke, H.W., Zelinski, E.M.

The American Geriatrics Society.</ref>\n[[File:Brain animated color nevit.gif|thumb|Human Brain]]\nTwo cognitive training methods are:\n\n* ''Strategy training'' is used to help individuals remember increasing amounts of information of a particular type. It involves teaching effective approaches to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Working memory#Neural maintenance|maintenance]], and/or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] from working memory. The main goal of strategy training is to increase performance in tasks requiring retention of information. Studies strongly support the claim that the amount of information remembered can be increased by rehearsing out loud, telling a story with stimuli, or using imagery to make stimuli stand out. Strategy training has been used in children with [[Down syndrome]] and also in older adult populations.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n* ''Core training'' involves repetition of demanding working memory tasks.  Some core training programs involve a combination of several tasks with widely varying stimulus types. The diversity of exercises increase the chance that one of, or some combination of the training tasks, will produce desired training-related gains. A goal of cognitive training is to impact the ease and success of cognitive performance in one's daily life. Core training can reduce the symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and improve the quality of life involving patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[schizophrenia]] and also, those who have suffered from [[stroke]].<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe manner in which a training study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of [[expectancy bias]] relates to [[placebo]] effects, which is the belief that training should have a positive influence on cognition.  A [[Treatment group|control group]] may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training.  Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect.  An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability.  The study may result in inconsistency if there are a variety of comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, assessment conditions, training setting and control group selection.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe Five x Five System is a set of memory enhancement tools that are scientifically validated.

Memory deficits, age-related memory loss, and people's want to improve their own memory has lead to research on how to best help people to improve their memory. Research has also worked to determine what factors influence memory and cognition. Many different techniques to improve memory have been found, including [[cognitive training]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[stress management]], and [[exercise]]. Each technique has the ability to influence memory in a different ways. [[Neuroimaging]] has also provided [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] evidence supporting [[Holism|holistic]] ways in which one can improve memory.\n\n==Memory function factors==\n\n=== Neuroplasticity===\n[[Neuroplasticity]] is the mechanism by which the brain encodes experience, learns new behaviours and relearns lost behaviour if the brain has been damaged.<ref name=\"Kleim\">Kleim, JA., & Jones, TA.

[[London]] [[taxicab]] drivers provide a great example of this dynamic. They undergo extensive training for 2\u20134 years, learning and memorizing street names, layout of streets within the city and the quickest cross-city routes.  After studying London taxicab drivers over a period of time, it was found that the [[grey matter]] volume increased over time in the posterior [[hippocampus]], an area in the brain involved heavily in memory. The longer taxi drivers navigated the streets of London, the greater the posterior hippocampal gray matter volume.  This suggests a correlation between a healthy person's mental training or exercise and their brains capacity to manage greater volume and more complex information. The increase in volume actually led to a decrease in the taxi drivers' ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information.<ref name=\"Maguire\">Maguire, EA., Woollett, K., & Spiers, HJ. (2006).

In one experiment, the goal was to prove that cognitive training would increase the cognitive functions in older adults by using three types of training (memory, reasoning and speed of processing). It was found that improvements in cognitive ability not only was maintained over time but had a positive transfer effect on everyday functioning. Therefore, these results indicate that each type of cognitive training can produce immediate and lasting improvements in each kind of cognitive ability, thus suggesting that training can be beneficial to improving memory.<ref name=\"Willis\">Willis, SL., Tennstedt, SL., Marsiske, M., Ball, K., Elias, J., Koepke, KM., Morris, JN., Rebok, GW., Unverzagt, FW., Stoddard, AM., & Wright, E.

National Institutes of Health, 296(23), 2805-2814.</ref>\n\nCognitive training in areas other than memory has actually been seen to generalize and transfer to memory systems. For example, the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) study by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] in 2009 demonstrated that cognitive training designed to improve accuracy and speed of the [[auditory system]] presented improvements in memory and attention system functioning as well as auditory functioning.<ref>Smith, G.E., Housen, P., Yaffe, K., Ruff, R., Kennison, R.F., Mahncke, H.W., Zelinski, E.M.

The American Geriatrics Society.</ref>\n[[File:Brain animated color nevit.gif|thumb|Human Brain]]\nTwo cognitive training methods are:\n\n* ''Strategy training'' is used to help individuals remember increasing amounts of information of a particular type. It involves teaching effective approaches to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Working memory#Neural maintenance|maintenance]], and/or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] from working memory. The main goal of strategy training is to increase performance in tasks requiring retention of information. Studies strongly support the claim that the amount of information remembered can be increased by rehearsing out loud, telling a story with stimuli, or using imagery to make stimuli stand out. Strategy training has been used in children with [[Down syndrome]] and also in older adult populations.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n* ''Core training'' involves repetition of demanding working memory tasks.  Some core training programs involve a combination of several tasks with widely varying stimulus types. The diversity of exercises increase the chance that one of, or some combination of the training tasks, will produce desired training-related gains. A goal of cognitive training is to impact the ease and success of cognitive performance in one's daily life. Core training can reduce the symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and improve the quality of life involving patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[schizophrenia]] and also, those who have suffered from [[stroke]].<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe manner in which a training study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of [[expectancy bias]] relates to [[placebo]] effects, which is the belief that training should have a positive influence on cognition.  A [[Treatment group|control group]] may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training.  Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect.  An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability.  The study may result in inconsistency if there are a variety of comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, assessment conditions, training setting and control group selection.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe Five x Five System is a set of memory enhancement tools that are scientifically validated. The system was created by Dr Peter Marshall for research purposes at Royal Holloway, University of London. The system involves 5 groups of 5 tactics designed to maximise storage and recall at each stage of the process of registering, short-term storage, long-term storage, consolidation and retrieval and was designed to test efficacy of including memory training in school curricula.

The bus route's layover area is now on the north side of Union Turnpike.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/planned_servChanges_Q23.htm|title=Permanent Route and Bus Stop Changes in Forest Hills|last=|first=|date=September 3, 2017|website=web.mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|language=en|access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{attached KML|display=inline,title|from=Q23 (New York City bus)}}\n* {{commons category inline|Q23 (New York City bus)}}\n\n{{Queens bus routes}}\n\n[[Category:MTA Regional Bus routes|Q023]]\n[[Category:Bus routes in Queens, New York|023]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Bus route in Queens, New York}}\n{{For|additional information on the current bus services|List of bus routes in Queens#Q23}}\n{{Infobox bus line\n|box_width     = 300px\n|number        = {{NYC bus infobox header |title=q23 }}\n|logo          = <!-- bus logo (ex: Image_name.png) -->\n|logo_width    = <!-- width of bus logo -->\n|logo_alt      = <!-- logo image alternate text (only works if logo_width is supplied) -->\n|bgcolor       = #0000e6 <!-- background color for infobox title (hex codes need a '#', i.e. #00ff33 not 00ff33) -->\n|titlecolor    = white<!-- color of the title text (hex codes need a '#') -->\n|subheader     = 108th Street\u2212Ditmars Boulevard<ref name=LIStar-TriboroAd-1943>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252014%2FLong%2520Island%2520City%2520NY%2520Star%2520Journal%2FLong%2520Island%2520City%2520NY%2520Star%2520Journal%25201943%2FLong%2520Island%2520City%2520NY%2520Star%2520Journal%25201943%2520-%25202418.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2Fabc48b51b92d5b64af849648b34bcb87#page=1|title=TRIBORO COACH  CORP.

The Q23 was formerly privately operated by the [[Triboro Coach|Triboro Coach Corporation]], under a subsidized franchise with the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] (NYCDOT). The route is now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[MTA Bus Company]] brand. The bus provides service between East Elmhurst in northwestern Queens to Glendale in central Queens, running mainly along 108th Street, providing access to the subway in Forest Hills.\n\n==Route description and service==\n===Northbound===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = MTA_Union_Tpke_Forest_Crescent_02.jpg\n| image2    = MTA Union Tpke Forest Crescent 04 - New Q23 Layover.jpg\n| width     = 200\n| footer    = The former Forest Hills terminal at Forest View Crescent (top), and the new layover area across Union Turnpike (bottom)\n| footer_align      = left\n}}\nThe northbound Q23 makes a winding loop in order to get onto 71st Avenue. It originates at Union Turnpike at Stop & Shop in [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], just east of the abandoned [[Rockaway Beach Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR).<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/busqns.pdf|title=Queens Bus Map|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)]]}}</ref> It then turns right at Woodhaven Boulevard, passing over the LIRR's [[Montauk Branch]], before making another right at Metropolitan Avenue. The Q23 then turns left onto 71st Avenue. The northbound route is about {{Convert|0.25|mi|km}} away from the northbound route through this stretch. At Kessel Street, the Q23 turns left, then two blocks later, turns right onto 69th Avenue. Due to a height restriction between Austin and Burns Street, the Q23 cannot return to 71st Avenue until it crosses the LIRR's [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]]. To do that, the Q23 takes a circuitous route, turning left onto Burns Street, right onto Yellowstone Boulevard (traveling underneath the LIRR), right onto Austin Street, and left onto 71st Avenue. One block north at [[Queens Boulevard]], the Q23 turns onto 108th Street, remaining on the street until 43rd Avenue, where it turns left.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" />\n\nIn Corona, the Q23 turns right from 43rd Avenue to National Street, then continues onto 103rd Street when National Street ends at [[Roosevelt Avenue]]. In [[East Elmhurst, Queens|East Elmhurst]], the Q23 makes a series of successive turns that resembles a hook shape. It turns left from 103rd Street onto 32nd Avenue, then turns right onto 101st Street, right onto [[Astoria Boulevard]], and left onto 29th Avenue. This hook-shaped path is due to the presence of a median on Astoria Boulevard that blocks through traffic from 103rd Street.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" /> The Q23 then turns left at [[Ditmars Boulevard]], then terminates a few blocks later at 102nd Street near [[LaGuardia Airport]].<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" />\n\n===Southbound===\nThe southbound Q23 originates at 102nd Street and Ditmars Boulevard near LaGuardia Airport.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" /> The southbound route is straighter in East Elmhurst than the northbound route is. From Ditmars Boulevard, it turns right onto 29th Avenue, then left onto 102nd Street, which is a different street than the 102nd Street where the Q23 originated due to the area's street grid.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" /> The Q23 continues south on 102nd Street until 37th Avenue, where it turns left. At 104th Street, it turns right, then the Q23 turns left again at 43rd Avenue and right at 108th Street, following the path of the northbound route until 69th Avenue in Forest Hills.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" /> The Q23 turns left onto Loubet Street, then makes a right onto 71st Avenue, since Kessel Street is one-way northwest-bound. It goes straight onto 71st Avenue, before turning right onto Union Turnpike, where it terminates.<ref name=\"MTA-QnsBusMap-Current32\" />\n\n== History ==\nQ23 service began in 1925 as a [[North Shore Bus Company]] route.<ref name=\"Bus Route History2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagorailfan.com/nycdateq.html|title=NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT ROUTES|website=www.chicagorailfan.com|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FFlushing%2520NY%2520North%2520Shore%2520%2520Daily%2520Journal%2FFlushing%2520NY%2520North%2520Shore%2520%2520Daily%2520Journal%25201936%2FFlushing%2520NY%2520North%2520Shore%2520%2520Daily%2520Journal%25201936%252000089.pdf|title=Committee Report Names Bus Operators For 3 Zones In Queens|last=|first=|date=January 10, 1936|work=North Shore Daily Journal|access-date=July 30, 2017|page=7}}</ref> The route initially ran between Ditmars Boulevard and 29th Avenue in East Elmhurst and Otis Avenue and Corona Avenue in Corona.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jq7h4X8FYzoC|title=The Chase National Bank of the City of New York, Successor by Consolidation to The Equitable Trust COmpany of New york, as Trustee, Under a Deed of Trust Entered Into Between John D.

On November 29, 2015, the Q44 was converted into a [[Select Bus Service]] (SBS) route.\n\n==Route description and service==\n{{see also|Main Street (Queens)#Route description|l1=Main Street (Queens)}}\n\n===Q44===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = New Flyer XD60 Q44 SelectBusService.jpg\n| caption1  = A [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer XD60]] in Q44 SBS service near [[Parkchester (IRT Pelham Line)|Parkchester station]] in the Bronx\n| alt1      = \n| image2    = NYCT Bus 2015 New Flyer XD40 7386.jpg\n| caption2  = A standard-length New Flyer bus on Q44 SBS service, used as a supplement to the normal articulated fleet\n| alt2      = \n| width =  250\n| footer          = \n| footer_align      = left\n}}\n<!--[[File:New Flyer XD60 Q44 SelectBusService.jpg|thumb|left|A [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer XD60]] in Q44 SBS service near [[Parkchester (IRT Pelham Line)|Parkchester station]] in the Bronx.]]\n[[File:NYCT Bus 2015 New Flyer XD40 7386.jpg|thumb|right|A standard-length New Flyer bus on Q44 SBS service, used as a supplement to the normal articulated fleet.]]-->\nThe current Q44 route begins at the intersection of [[Merrick Road|Merrick Boulevard]] and Archer Avenue in Downtown [[Jamaica, Queens]] (or Jamaica Center), just south of the [[165th Street Bus Terminal]]. This terminus is shared with the {{NYC bus link|Q17}}. Traveling west along Archer Avenue, it passes the [[Jamaica Center\u2013Parsons/Archer (Archer Avenue Lines)|Jamaica Center]] station of the [[Archer Avenue Lines|Archer Avenue subway]] and its [[Jamaica Center\u2013Parsons/Archer (Archer Avenue Lines)#Jamaica Center Bus Terminal|bus terminal]]. At the [[Sutphin Boulevard\u2013Archer Avenue\u2013JFK Airport (Archer Avenue Lines)|Sutphin Boulevard]] subway station, which connects to the [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]] station of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] and [[AirTrain JFK]], the route turns north onto Sutphin Boulevard. It then turns west onto [[Hillside Avenue]] and north onto [[Queens Boulevard]], interchanging with two stations of the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]].<ref name=NYCgov-BRTQ44Jan222015 /><ref name=Q44SBSSched /><ref name=\"q44 brt 2015-06-09\" /><ref name=MTA-QnsBusMap-Current/>\n\nAt [[Main Street (Queens)|Main Street]] the Q44 turns north, running the entire distance of the street between Queens Boulevard and [[Northern Boulevard]] in [[Flushing, Queens|Downtown Flushing]] (also known as [[Chinatowns in Queens#Flushing|Flushing Chinatown]]). In Downtown Flushing is the [[Flushing\u2013Main Street (IRT Flushing Line)|Flushing\u2013Main Street]] terminal, where several bus lines, the [[IRT Flushing Line]] subway, and the LIRR [[Port Washington Branch]] interchange. The Q44 shifts onto Union Street and Parsons Boulevard to 14th Avenue in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]]. It then enters the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]], sharing the bridge with the {{NYC bus link|Q50}}. Throughout Queens, the Q44 provides [[limited-stop]] service, making intermittent stops primarily at major intersections and points of interest.<ref name=NYCgov-BRTQ44Jan222015 /><ref name=Q44SBSSched /><ref name=\"q44 brt 2015-06-09\" /><ref name=MTA-QnsBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|Q}}</ref>\n\nAfter entering [[the Bronx]], the Q44 and Q50 follow the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] service road to just south of the [[Bruckner Interchange]], making only two stops: one at Lafayette Avenue, and another one at Brush Avenue and Bruckner Blvd, where passengers can also connect to the {{NYC bus link|Bx5}} bus. While the Q50 turns east to follow the Bx5, the Q44 turns west onto East 177th Street (the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] service road), running along either direction of the road. At the [[Parkchester (IRT Pelham Line)|Parkchester]] subway station, the Q44 goes around the [[Hugh J. Grant]] Circle. The Q44 continues along East 177th Street until the interchange with the [[New York State Route 895|Sheridan Expressway]], where it turns north onto Devoe Avenue. The Q44 stops at East [[Tremont Avenue]] near the [[West Farms Square\u2013East Tremont Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|West Farms Square]] subway station, and terminates at East 180th Street at the southern boundary of the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Buses lay over on a bridge over the [[Bronx River]], before reentering service on [[Boston Post Road|Boston Road]]. Although the Q44's northern terminal is signed as \"Bronx Zoo\" (formerly \"Bronx Zoo \u2212 West Farms Square\"), the zoo is not accessible from this location; the closest entrance is several blocks north at Bronx Park South and Boston Road.<ref name=NYCgov-BRTQ44Jan222015 /><ref name=Q44SBSSched /><ref name=\"q44 brt 2015-06-09\" /><ref name=MTA-BxBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|Bx}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1999, the Q44 ran entirely local between Jamaica, Queens and West Farms, Bronx. It was the only bus service along Main Street in Queens.<ref name=\"DailyNews-Q44Q20-Briarwood-1999\" /> Before the implementation of Select Bus Service in November 2015, the route ran entirely local along East 177th Street.

The Q20A branches off at 20th Avenue, running along the northern edge of the former [[Flushing Airport]] and serving a large shopping center. This route is shared with the {{NYC bus link|Q76}}. The Q20B turns west farther north at 14th Avenue, running through a much more residential area. Both the 20th and 14th Avenue routes were part of the original Q20, which only ran between College Point and Downtown Flushing.

The Q20A/B terminates in [[College Point, Queens|College Point]] at the north end of Queens. The Q44 continues north into the borough of [[the Bronx]], terminating in the [[West Farms, Bronx|West Farms]] neighborhood near the [[Bronx Zoo]]. The Q44 is one of two Queens bus routes to operate between the two boroughs (along with the {{NYC bus link|Q50}}).\n\nThe Q44 and Q20 were originally operated by the [[North Shore Bus Company]] from the 1930s to 1947; they are now operated by [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]] under the [[New York City Transit Authority|New York City Transit]] brand. In June 1999, the Q44 began limited stop service in Queens, with the Q20 split into two branches to provide local service.

In Downtown Flushing is the [[Flushing\u2013Main Street (IRT Flushing Line)|Flushing\u2013Main Street]] terminal, where several bus lines, the [[IRT Flushing Line]] subway, and the LIRR [[Port Washington Branch]] interchange. The Q44 shifts onto Union Street and Parsons Boulevard to 14th Avenue in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]].

While the Q50 turns east to follow the Bx5, the Q44 turns west onto East 177th Street (the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] service road), running along either direction of the road. At the [[Parkchester (IRT Pelham Line)|Parkchester]] subway station, the Q44 goes around the [[Hugh J. Grant]] Circle. The Q44 continues along East 177th Street until the interchange with the [[New York State Route 895|Sheridan Expressway]], where it turns north onto Devoe Avenue. The Q44 stops at East [[Tremont Avenue]] near the [[West Farms Square\u2013East Tremont Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|West Farms Square]] subway station, and terminates at East 180th Street at the southern boundary of the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Buses lay over on a bridge over the [[Bronx River]], before reentering service on [[Boston Post Road|Boston Road]]. Although the Q44's northern terminal is signed as \"Bronx Zoo\" (formerly \"Bronx Zoo \u2212 West Farms Square\"), the zoo is not accessible from this location; the closest entrance is several blocks north at Bronx Park South and Boston Road.<ref name=NYCgov-BRTQ44Jan222015 /><ref name=Q44SBSSched /><ref name=\"q44 brt 2015-06-09\" /><ref name=MTA-BxBusMap-Current>{{Cite NYC bus map|Bx}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1999, the Q44 ran entirely local between Jamaica, Queens and West Farms, Bronx.

The Q20B turns west farther north at 14th Avenue, running through a much more residential area.
