He won a [[Super Bowl]] as [[head coach]] of the [[Oakland Raiders]], and after retiring from coaching became a well-known [[color commentator]] for NFL telecasts.  In 2006, he was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his coaching career.  He is also widely known for the long-running ''[[Madden NFL]]'' video game series he has endorsed and fronted since 1988. Madden worked as a color analyst for all four major networks: [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] (1979\u20131993), [[NFL on FOX|Fox]] (1994\u20132001), [[Monday Night Football|ABC]] (2002\u20132005), and [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] (2006\u20132008).

While at SDSU, Madden coached under [[Don Coryell]], whom Madden credits as being an influence on his coaching and who he feels will one day be included in the Hall of Fame.<ref name=PFHOF>{{cite web|title=John Madden's biography|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/players/john-madden/biography|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Professional coaching with the Oakland Raiders===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2017}}\nBuilding on that success, Madden was hired by [[Al Davis]] as linebackers coach for the [[American Football League|AFL's]] [[Oakland Raiders]] in [[1967 American Football League season|1967]], putting him in the [[Sid Gillman]] [[coaching tree]].  He helped the team reach [[Super Bowl II]] that season. A year later, after Raiders head coach [[John Rauch]] resigned to take the same position with the [[Buffalo Bills]], Madden was named the Raiders' head coach on February 4, 1969, becoming, at the age of 32, professional football's youngest head coach to that time. According to former Raiders coach [[Dennis Allen (American football)|Dennis Allen]], John Madden was arguably the best [[Oakland Raiders]] coach in the history of the team.\n\nMadden's Raiders reached and lost five AFC Title games in seven years, which left the Raiders with the same image that the [[Dallas Cowboys]] had previously had\u2014as a team unable to \"win the big one.\" Despite a 12\u20131\u20131 mark in [[1969 American Football League season|1969]], the team lost 17\u20137 to the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in the final American Football League championship game. [[1972 NFL season|Three years later]], what appeared to be a last-minute victory over the Steelers instead became a part of football lore when Franco Harris' \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\" gave [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] a 13\u20137 win. Then, in 1974, after defeating the two-time, and defending Super Bowl champion [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] in dramatic fashion, the [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] lost again to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the AFC Championship game.\nIn [[1975 NFL season]], the Raiders went 11\u20133 and lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the AFC Championship game by a score of 16\u201310.\n\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] went 13\u20131 in the regular season, and escaped the first round of the playoffs with a dramatic and controversial victory over the [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In the second round of the playoffs they defeated the [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] for the AFC Championship. On January 9, 1977, Madden's Raiders finally captured their first Super Bowl with a convincing 32\u201314 win over the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. The [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] lost the AFC Championship Game in [[1977 NFL season|1977]] to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. After the Raiders failed to qualify for the postseason in [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Madden announced his retirement on January 4, 1979 due to an increasingly deteriorating ulcer condition and [[occupational burnout]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/05/archives/madden-citing-health-resigns-as-coach-of-raiders-best-step-to-take.html \"Madden, Citing Health, Resigns as Coach of Raiders,\" ''The New York Times'', Friday, January 5, 1979.] Retrieved November 21, 2019</ref>\n\nAmong Madden's accomplishments as a head coach were winning a Super Bowl, and becoming the youngest coach to reach 100 career regular season victories, a record he compiled in only ten full seasons of coaching at the age of 42. Madden is still the coach with the most wins in Raiders history.\n\nMadden never had a losing season as a head coach. His overall winning percentage, including playoff games, ranks second in league history. Madden achieved his record during a period that included head coaches [[Tom Landry]], [[Don Shula]], [[Chuck Noll]] and [[Bud Grant]], who are generally regarded as the top coaches of that era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=2319004 |title=Young fans introduced to NFL through Madden games&nbsp;\u2013 NFL&nbsp;\u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=February 4, 2006 |accessdate=October 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Head coaching record===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Post season\n|-\n!Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!

Prior to teaming with Summerall on CBS, Madden was paired with a variety of announcers, such as [[Dick Stockton]], [[Frank Glieber]] and [[Gary Bender]]. The team of Madden and Summerall would go on to call eight Super Bowls together (five for CBS and three for Fox). On occasions in which Summerall was unavailable (during the CBS years, Summerall was normally scheduled to commentate on the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] tennis tournament during the early weeks of the NFL season), Madden would team with the likes of [[Vin Scully]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/did-you-know-vin-scully-almost-became-john-maddens-partner-at-cbs.html|title=Did you know Vin Scully almost became John Madden's partner at CBS?|last1=Fang|first1=Ken|last2= |first2= |date=May 24, 2016|website=Awful Announcing|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and subsequently, [[Verne Lundquist]]. On their final CBS telecast together (the [[NFL playoffs, 1993-94#NFC: Dallas Cowboys 38, San Francisco 49ers 21|NFC Championship Game]] on January 23, 1994), Madden told Summerall that while CBS may no longer have the NFL (for the time being, as CBS would eventually regain NFL rights in [[1998 NFL season|1998]] by outbidding NBC for the rights to [[American Football Conference|AFC]] telecasts), at least they have the memories. On [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s final ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' telecast in [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Madden used a similar choice of words.\n\n====Fox Sports====\nWhen the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] gained the rights to NFC games in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], CBS employees became free agents. Madden was the biggest star in football broadcasting, and Fox, ABC, and NBC made offers higher than the $2 million a year maximum for sportscaster salaries; NBC's owner [[General Electric]] offered to make Madden its \"worldwide spokesman\", and [[GE Rail]] would build for him a luxury train.

Madden also reached the milestone of calling the Super Bowl on all of the \"Big Four\" broadcast networks when he appeared on the 2009 broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]]. On October 13, 2008, NBC announced that Madden would not be traveling to the October 19 ''Sunday Night Football'' [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]\u2013[[2009 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] game in [[Tampa, Florida]], marking the end of Madden's 476-weekend streak of consecutive broadcast appearances. Madden, who travels by bus, decided to take the week off because he had traveled from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to San Diego, and would have had to go back to Florida before returning to his [[Northern California]] home.

Previously the show was on every weekday with one show at 8:15&nbsp;a.m. Pacific Time and often another at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. Since his return, Madden airs on Mondays and Fridays only, at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. Through the years, Madden often took on a fantasy persona, discussing how he ran the [[Boston Marathon]] the day before the event to avoid the crowds or even discussions about taking part in the Alaskan Iditarod Trails Sled Dog race. Madden has also aired sports commentaries in syndication on the [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] radio network in the United States.\n\n===Film===\nMadden was briefly featured in the film [[Christine (1983 film)|''Christine'']]. Madden was seen coaching an American football team during a television broadcast.\n\nMadden was also featured in the movie ''[[Little Giants]]''. A bus full of NFL pros gets lost and happens to come across the kids looking for directions. Madden helps the team draw up the eventual game-winning play, \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico\", which was a version of a [[fumblerooski]].\n\nMadden also played himself as the broadcaster of the fictional games in the film ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]'' alongside his broadcast partner at the time [[Pat Summerall]].\n\nA film clip interview of Madden about [[De La Salle High School (Concord, California)|De La Salle]] football coach [[Bob Ladouceur]] appears near the beginning of the end credits of the 2014 film ''[[When the Game Stands Tall]]''.\n\n===Advertising===\nMadden has appeared in a variety of radio and television commercials including [[Ace Hardware]], [[Outback Steakhouse]] (the corporate sponsor of the ''Maddencruiser''),<ref name=nyt1/> [[Verizon Wireless]], [[Rent-A-Center]], [[Miller Lite]], [[Toyota]], [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and [[Tinactin|\"Tough Actin\" Tinactin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2YlMNeSsgAC&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=You've Got to Be Believed to Be Heard: The Complete Book of Speaking . . . in Business and in Life!|first=Bert|last=Decker|date=September 16, 2008|publisher=Macmillan|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=forbes/>{{r|curtis20181213}} In particular, the Miller beer advertisements cemented Madden's image in the public eye as a bumbling but lovable personality.<ref name=adage>{{cite web | url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/miller-lite-air-classic-john-madden-ad/306355/ | title=Miller Lite Brings Back Classic John Madden Ad | last=Schultz | first=E.J. | publisher=[[Advertising Age]] | date=October 19, 2016 | accessdate=February 11, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nMadden had a brief movie role playing himself in the 1994 youth football film ''[[Little Giants]]'' and in the 2000 film ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]''. He appeared in a 1999 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[Sunday, Cruddy Sunday]]\". Madden also hosted an episode of NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1982 with musical guest [[Jennifer Holliday]]. As well, Madden was featured in the Irish band [[U2]]'s music video for the song \"[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]\". In the video, Madden is commenting on a fake football game featuring [[Bono|Paul Hewson]] as the kicker who misses a short kick to win the game. He makes a similar appearance in the video for [[Paul Simon|Paul Simon's]] 1972 single \"[[Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard]]\",<ref>{{cite web | title=Paul Simon - Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VrKro8djw}}</ref> in which he attempts to teach football fundamentals to a group of kids playing a pickup game.\n\nHe has also recorded radio and television [[public service announcement]]s for a number of causes, including NBC/[[Ad Council]]'s [[The More You Know]] in 2009 and Vascular Cures (formerly the Pacific Vascular Research Foundation) in [[Redwood City, California]] (based on the health experiences of his wife, Virginia Madden).\n\nTo minimize travel to studios, Madden built Goal Line Productions in Pleasanton, Calif.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flip2media.com/video-production-ad-agency-about/|title=About our Video Production and Advertising Agency Team |accessdate=February 24, 2020}}</ref> a facility that is now managed by his son, Joe.

Entries in the series have consistently been best-sellers, to the extent that they have even spawned TV shows featuring competition between players of the games. Despite Madden's retirement as a broadcaster in 2009, he still continues to lend his name and provide creative input to the series,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ea-madden-nfl-franchise-to-continue-contract-long-term-2009-4|title=EA: Madden NFL Franchise To Continue, Contract 'Long Term' (ERTS)|date=April 16, 2009|work=Silicon Alley Insider|publisher=The Business Insider|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}</ref> which is so popular that he is better known as the face of ''Madden'' than as a Super Bowl-winning coach and broadcaster.{{r|thefranchise}}\n\nMadden views the game as an educational tool.

His announcing style is punctuated with interjections such as \"Boom!\", \"Whap!\", \"Bang!\" and \"Doink!\"' and with his use of the [[telestrator]], a device which allows him to superimpose his light-penned diagrams of football plays over video footage. Madden's use of the telestrator helped to popularize the technology, which has become a staple of television coverage of all sports.\n\nMadden was also known for working the annual [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] for CBS and later Fox.  He would award a turkey or [[Turducken#Cultural references|turducken]] to players of the winning team. He would also award a turkey drumstick to players of the winning team during the Thanksgiving Day game, often bringing out a \"nuclear turkey\" with as many as eight drumsticks on it for the occasion. The drumsticks served as an odd take on the \"player of the game\" award. Madden stopped announcing the Thanksgiving Day games after he moved to ABC in 2002, but the tradition continued. Fox, CBS, and the NFL Network present the Galloping Gobbler, the All-Iron Award, and the Pudding Pie Award, respectively, to the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|game's \"Most Valuable\" player]].\n\n===Aversion to flying===\nMadden's aversion to flying is well known. Two different theories have developed as to the cause.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} One theory relates to the October 29, 1960, [[Cal Poly football team plane crash]] that claimed the lives of sixteen players, the team's student manager, and a football booster. Having graduated from [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly]] only two years prior, Madden lost many friends in the accident. However, it is known that Madden flew up until 1979, when he had a panic attack on a flight originating in Tampa. The details, nature and extent of this panic attack are not known. Madden, however, stated once in an interview that his fears were not about turbulence, flying, or [[Acrophobia|heights]], but primarily [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28380636// |title=Madden, Tollner recall deadly plane crash of '60&nbsp;\u2013 College football&nbsp;\u2013 NBC Sports |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906173209/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28380636// |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He also once noted that when he did fly, traveling all over the United States, it did not allow him to see anything.\n\nDuring his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' hosting appearance in the early 1980s, a short film aired depicting Madden making the journey to New York to host ''SNL'' by train.

Likewise, Madden never called any preseason game held outside of North America, even when his play-by-play partner was on the telecast.

He won a [[Super Bowl]] as [[head coach]] of the [[Oakland Raiders]], and after retiring from coaching became a well-known [[color commentator]] for NFL telecasts.  In 2006, he was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his coaching career.  He is also widely known for the long-running ''[[Madden NFL]]'' video game series he has endorsed and fronted since 1988. Madden worked as a color analyst for all four major networks: [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] (1979\u20131993), [[NFL on FOX|Fox]] (1994\u20132001), [[Monday Night Football|ABC]] (2002\u20132005), and [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] (2006\u20132008). Madden retired from [[broadcasting]] after the [[2008 NFL season]] to spend more time with his family.<ref name=forbes>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/16/john-madden-retires-nbc-nfl-business-sports-john-madden.html|title=John Madden retires|date=April 16, 2009|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}</ref> He has also written several books and has served as a commercial pitchman for various products and retailers.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Madden was born in [[Austin, Minnesota]] to Earl Russell Madden and Mary Margaret (n\u00e9e Flaherty) Madden.

Following the [[1963 college football season|1963 season]], he was hired as a defensive assistant coach at [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]], where he served through [[1966 college football season|1966]].\n\nDuring that final campaign, the [[San Diego State Aztecs football|Aztecs]] were ranked among the top small colleges in the country. While at SDSU, Madden coached under [[Don Coryell]], whom Madden credits as being an influence on his coaching and who he feels will one day be included in the Hall of Fame.<ref name=PFHOF>{{cite web|title=John Madden's biography|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/players/john-madden/biography|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Professional coaching with the Oakland Raiders===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2017}}\nBuilding on that success, Madden was hired by [[Al Davis]] as linebackers coach for the [[American Football League|AFL's]] [[Oakland Raiders]] in [[1967 American Football League season|1967]], putting him in the [[Sid Gillman]] [[coaching tree]].  He helped the team reach [[Super Bowl II]] that season. A year later, after Raiders head coach [[John Rauch]] resigned to take the same position with the [[Buffalo Bills]], Madden was named the Raiders' head coach on February 4, 1969, becoming, at the age of 32, professional football's youngest head coach to that time. According to former Raiders coach [[Dennis Allen (American football)|Dennis Allen]], John Madden was arguably the best [[Oakland Raiders]] coach in the history of the team.\n\nMadden's Raiders reached and lost five AFC Title games in seven years, which left the Raiders with the same image that the [[Dallas Cowboys]] had previously had\u2014as a team unable to \"win the big one.\" Despite a 12\u20131\u20131 mark in [[1969 American Football League season|1969]], the team lost 17\u20137 to the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in the final American Football League championship game. [[1972 NFL season|Three years later]], what appeared to be a last-minute victory over the Steelers instead became a part of football lore when Franco Harris' \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\" gave [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] a 13\u20137 win. Then, in 1974, after defeating the two-time, and defending Super Bowl champion [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] in dramatic fashion, the [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] lost again to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the AFC Championship game.\nIn [[1975 NFL season]], the Raiders went 11\u20133 and lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the AFC Championship game by a score of 16\u201310.\n\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] went 13\u20131 in the regular season, and escaped the first round of the playoffs with a dramatic and controversial victory over the [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In the second round of the playoffs they defeated the [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] for the AFC Championship. On January 9, 1977, Madden's Raiders finally captured their first Super Bowl with a convincing 32\u201314 win over the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. The [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] lost the AFC Championship Game in [[1977 NFL season|1977]] to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. After the Raiders failed to qualify for the postseason in [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Madden announced his retirement on January 4, 1979 due to an increasingly deteriorating ulcer condition and [[occupational burnout]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/05/archives/madden-citing-health-resigns-as-coach-of-raiders-best-step-to-take.html \"Madden, Citing Health, Resigns as Coach of Raiders,\" ''The New York Times'', Friday, January 5, 1979.] Retrieved November 21, 2019</ref>\n\nAmong Madden's accomplishments as a head coach were winning a Super Bowl, and becoming the youngest coach to reach 100 career regular season victories, a record he compiled in only ten full seasons of coaching at the age of 42. Madden is still the coach with the most wins in Raiders history.\n\nMadden never had a losing season as a head coach. His overall winning percentage, including playoff games, ranks second in league history. Madden achieved his record during a period that included head coaches [[Tom Landry]], [[Don Shula]], [[Chuck Noll]] and [[Bud Grant]], who are generally regarded as the top coaches of that era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=2319004 |title=Young fans introduced to NFL through Madden games&nbsp;\u2013 NFL&nbsp;\u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=February 4, 2006 |accessdate=October 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Head coaching record===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Post season\n|-\n!Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!

Prior to teaming with Summerall on CBS, Madden was paired with a variety of announcers, such as [[Dick Stockton]], [[Frank Glieber]] and [[Gary Bender]]. The team of Madden and Summerall would go on to call eight Super Bowls together (five for CBS and three for Fox). On occasions in which Summerall was unavailable (during the CBS years, Summerall was normally scheduled to commentate on the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] tennis tournament during the early weeks of the NFL season), Madden would team with the likes of [[Vin Scully]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/did-you-know-vin-scully-almost-became-john-maddens-partner-at-cbs.html|title=Did you know Vin Scully almost became John Madden's partner at CBS?|last1=Fang|first1=Ken|last2= |first2= |date=May 24, 2016|website=Awful Announcing|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and subsequently, [[Verne Lundquist]]. On their final CBS telecast together (the [[NFL playoffs, 1993-94#NFC: Dallas Cowboys 38, San Francisco 49ers 21|NFC Championship Game]] on January 23, 1994), Madden told Summerall that while CBS may no longer have the NFL (for the time being, as CBS would eventually regain NFL rights in [[1998 NFL season|1998]] by outbidding NBC for the rights to [[American Football Conference|AFC]] telecasts), at least they have the memories. On [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s final ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' telecast in [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Madden used a similar choice of words.\n\n====Fox Sports====\nWhen the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] gained the rights to NFC games in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], CBS employees became free agents. Madden was the biggest star in football broadcasting, and Fox, ABC, and NBC made offers higher than the $2 million a year maximum for sportscaster salaries; NBC's owner [[General Electric]] offered to make Madden its \"worldwide spokesman\", and [[GE Rail]] would build for him a luxury train.

Madden also reached the milestone of calling the Super Bowl on all of the \"Big Four\" broadcast networks when he appeared on the 2009 broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]].

Madden, who travels by bus, decided to take the week off because he had traveled from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to San Diego, and would have had to go back to Florida before returning to his [[Northern California]] home.

Previously the show was on every weekday with one show at 8:15&nbsp;a.m. Pacific Time and often another at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. Since his return, Madden airs on Mondays and Fridays only, at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. Through the years, Madden often took on a fantasy persona, discussing how he ran the [[Boston Marathon]] the day before the event to avoid the crowds or even discussions about taking part in the Alaskan Iditarod Trails Sled Dog race. Madden has also aired sports commentaries in syndication on the [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] radio network in the United States.\n\n===Film===\nMadden was briefly featured in the film [[Christine (1983 film)|''Christine'']].

His announcing style is punctuated with interjections such as \"Boom!\", \"Whap!\", \"Bang!\" and \"Doink!\"' and with his use of the [[telestrator]], a device which allows him to superimpose his light-penned diagrams of football plays over video footage. Madden's use of the telestrator helped to popularize the technology, which has become a staple of television coverage of all sports.\n\nMadden was also known for working the annual [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] for CBS and later Fox.  He would award a turkey or [[Turducken#Cultural references|turducken]] to players of the winning team. He would also award a turkey drumstick to players of the winning team during the Thanksgiving Day game, often bringing out a \"nuclear turkey\" with as many as eight drumsticks on it for the occasion. The drumsticks served as an odd take on the \"player of the game\" award. Madden stopped announcing the Thanksgiving Day games after he moved to ABC in 2002, but the tradition continued.

Having graduated from [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly]] only two years prior, Madden lost many friends in the accident. However, it is known that Madden flew up until 1979, when he had a panic attack on a flight originating in Tampa. The details, nature and extent of this panic attack are not known. Madden, however, stated once in an interview that his fears were not about turbulence, flying, or [[Acrophobia|heights]], but primarily [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28380636// |title=Madden, Tollner recall deadly plane crash of '60&nbsp;\u2013 College football&nbsp;\u2013 NBC Sports |publisher=Nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906173209/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28380636// |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He also once noted that when he did fly, traveling all over the United States, it did not allow him to see anything.\n\nDuring his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' hosting appearance in the early 1980s, a short film aired depicting Madden making the journey to New York to host ''SNL'' by train.
