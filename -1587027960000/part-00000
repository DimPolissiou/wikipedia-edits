Covering much of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and [[Outer Hebrides]], it is Scotland's largest county, though one of the smallest in population, with 67,733 people or 1.34% of the Scottish population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-towns.net/scotland/highland/invernesshire |title=The Area of Invernesshire |work=British Towns and Villages Network |date=28 September 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe extent of the lieutenancy area was defined in 1975 as covering the [[local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|districts]] of Inverness, [[Badenoch and Strathspey (local government district, Highland region)|Badenoch & Strathspey]], and [[Lochaber (local government district, Highland region)|Lochaber]].{{fact|date=November 2019}} Thus it differs from the county in that it includes parts of what were once [[County of Moray|Moray]] and [[Banffshire]], but does not include any of the [[Outer Hebrides]] which were given their own lieutenancy area \u2014 the [[Western Isles]].{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Stag at Loch Quoich - geograph.org.uk - 1805611.jpg|thumb|right|Loch Quoich]]\n[[File:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Nevis, Britain's tallest mountain]]\nInverness-shire is Scotland's largest county, and the second largest in the UK as a whole after [[Yorkshire]]. It borders [[Ross-shire]] to the north, [[Nairnshire]], [[County of Moray|Moray]], [[Banffshire]] and [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the east, and [[Perthshire]] and [[Argyllshire]] to the south.\n\nIts mainland section covers a large area of the [[Highlands]], bordering the [[Sea of the Hebrides]] to the west and [[Beauly Firth]] and [[Moray Firth]] to the east which provide access to the [[North Sea]]. It is split into two by the [[Great Glen]], a roughly 60 mile [[Great Glen Fault|geological fault]] which runs south-west to north-east and divides the [[Northwest Highlands]] to the west from the [[Grampian Mountains]] (including the [[Monadhliath Mountains]]) to the east. The glen contain the notable lochs of [[Loch Ness]] (Scotland's second largest), [[Loch Oich]] and [[Loch Lochy]], which are connected by the [[Caledonian Canal]]; it opens into the south-west into the sealoch [[Loch Linnhe]]. [[Ben Nevis]], the tallest peak in Britain, is located to the east of Fort William. The west coast consists of a number of large peninsulas divided by long loch inlets; north-to-south these are [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]] (shared with Ross-shire), [[Loch Hourn]], [[Knoydart]], [[Loch Nevis]], North and South [[Morar]]/[[Arisaig]], [[Loch nan Uamh]], [[Ardnish]], [[Loch Ailort]], [[Moidart]] and [[Loch Moidart]]. This area was traditionally referred to as the [[Rough Bounds]] due to its remoteness and inaccessibility and it remains wild and sparseley populated today. The terrain in Inverness-shire is generally mountainous, with numerous lochs scattered throughout the county, the largest of these being: [[Loch Ashie]], [[Loch Mhor]], [[Loch Knockie]], [[Loch Duntelchaig]], [[Loch Ruthven]], [[Loch Moy]], [[Loch Alvie]], [[Loch Insh]], [[Loch an Eilean]], [[Loch Killin]], [[Loch Crunachdan]], [[Loch Morlich]], [[Loch Garten]], [[Loch Einich]], [[Loch an t-Seilich]], [[Loch na Cuaich]], [[Loch Coaldair]], the [[Blackwater Reservoir]], [[Loch Treig]], [[Loch Ossian]], [[Loch Laggan]], [[Loch Spean]], [[Loch Ericht]], [[Loch Gulbin]], [[Lochan na h-Earba]], [[Loch Pattack]], [[Loch Eilde M\u00f2r]], [[Loch a' Bhealaich Bheithe]], [[Loch a' Bhealaich Leamhain]], [[Lochan L\u00f9nn D\u00e0-Bhr\u00e0]], [[Loch Bruicaich]], [[Loch Meiklie]], [[Loch ma Stac]], [[Loch a' Chr\u00e0thaich]], [[Loch na Beinne Baine]], [[Loch Lundie]], [[Loch Garry]], [[Loch Beannacharan]], [[Loch Beinn a Mheadhoin]], [[Loch Monar]], [[Loch Mullardoch]], [[Loch Affric]], [[Loch Cluanie]], [[Loch Loyne]], [[Loch Quoich]], [[Loch an Dubh-Lochain]], [[Loch Arkaig]], [[Loch Morar]], [[Loch Beoriad]], [[Loch Dhoire a' Ghearrain]] and [[Loch Shiel]].\n\nInverness-shire contains numerous small islands off its west coast which form part of the [[Inner Hebrides]]. The largest of these is [[Skye]], separated from the Inverness-shire mainland by the [[Sound of Sleat]]; popular with tourists, it is a huge, sprawling island - the second biggest in Scotland - containing numerous peninsulas and offshore islands. The small isle of [[Eigg]] is also within Inverness-shire, despite the other [[Small Isles]] being in Argyllshire. To the west, across the [[Little Minch]], most of the [[Outer Hebrides]] fall within the county, with the notable exception of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] which is in Ross-shire. Further west still lie the remote islands of [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], which have been uninhabited since 1930. Much further west, 230 miles from the Outer Hebrides, lies the extremely remote, uninhabitable island of [[Rockall]], which is subject to a territorial dispute with [[Ireland]].\n\n===Islands===\n*[[An t-Eilean Meadhoin]]\n*[[Brinacory Island]]\n*[[Eilean a' Ghiuthais]]\n*[[Eilean a' Phidhir]]\n*[[Eilean B\u00e0n]]\n*[[Eilean Choinneach]]\n*[[Eilean nam

a stag's head and in sinister chief a bull's head both erased, and in base a galley, sails furled, oars in action and flagged, all Or. Beneath the shield an escrol bearing this motto: ''{{lang|gd|Air son Math na Siorrachd}}''.\n\nThe galley represents [[Clan Chattan]], who aligned themselves under the banner of [[Somerled|Somerled, Lord of the Isles]]. The stag's head comes from the crest of the Frasers of Lovat, while the bull's head comes from the crest of the MacLeods of that Ilk. The motto is in Gaelic and means \"For the Good of the County\".\n\n==Local government==\n===1890\u20131975===\nInverness-shire acquired a [[county council]] in 1890, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], and, under the same legislation, boundaries were altered to make the county a single contiguous area, transferring several exclaves of other counties to Inverness-shire.\n\nAlthough the new boundaries were supposed to be valid for all purposes (unlike earlier boundaries, which were really default boundaries and not necessarily those used for any particular purpose), the burghs of Inverness, [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]], [[Kingussie]], which had their own town councils, retained autonomous status and were for some purposes beyond the writ of the new county council. The town of Inverness had been established as a [[royal burgh]] since the mid 12th century, Fort William, originally a Fort of that name built by the Government to keep the Highlanders in their place, around which grew up a village which became in turn Gordonsburgh, Maryburgh, Duncansburgh and latterly the town/burgh of Fort William which had been established as a [[burgh of barony]] since 1618 and [[Kingussie]] had been established as a burgh of barony since 1464. Also, use of the new boundaries for parliamentary elections was specifically excluded.\n\n===1975\u20131996===\nThe old county councils were abolished by the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] and Scotland was instead governed by a two-tier system of regions and districts. Mainland Inverness-shire was split amongst four districts of the [[Highland region]], whilst the county's territory in the Outer Hebrides was transferred to the [[Western Isles]] council area.\n\n* 1. The burgh of Inverness and the Aird and Inverness districts were merged to form the [[Inverness]] Local Government district of the Highland region.\n* 2. The burgh of Fort William and the Lochaber district were merged with areas from the [[county of Argyll]] (the Ardnamurchan district and the electoral divisions of Ballachulish and Kinlochleven) to form the [[Lochaber (local government district, Highland region)|Lochaber]] district of the Highland region.\n* 3. The Skye district was merged with an area from the [[county of Ross and Cromarty]] (the South West district) to form the [[Skye and Lochalsh (local government district, Highland region)|Skye and Lochalsh]] district of the Highland region.\n* 4. The [[burgh of Kingussie]] and the Badenoch district were merged with areas from the [[county of Moray]] (the [[burgh of Grantown-on-Spey]] and the Cromdale district) to form the [[Badenoch and Strathspey (local government district, Highland region)|Badenoch and Strathspey]] district of the Highland region.\n* The Barra, Harris, North Uist, and South Uist districts were merged with areas from the county of [[Ross and Cromarty]] (the [[burgh of Stornoway]] and Lewis district) to form the Western Isles council area.\n\nWithin the Highland region, local government functions were divided between the regional council and the district councils. For example, education was a regional responsibility, and housing was a district responsibility.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\nIn 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the two-tier system was abolished and the [[Highland (local government area)|Highland]] region became a [[unitary council area]].\n\nThe new unitary [[Highland Council]] adopted the areas of the former districts as [[politics of the Highland council area|management areas]]. Each management area was represented, initially, by [[area committee]]s consisting of [[councillor]]s elected from areas (groups of local government [[ward (politics)|ward]]s) corresponding to the management areas, but changes to ward boundaries in 1999 created a mismatch between committee areas and management areas.\n\nIn 2007, at the time of further changes to ward boundaries, which created 22 multi-member wards instead of 80 single-member wards, the council created a new management structure, with three new [[Politics of the Highland council area|corporate management area]]s and 16 new [[politics of the Highland council area|ward-level management area]]s. Also, four of the ward-level management areas, covering the seven wards, were grouped to form an Inverness city (or ''Inverness and Area'') management area.\n\nThe total number of Highland councillors is 80, elected by the [[single transferable vote system]] of election, which is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. Wards in the Inverness city area elect 26 of the 34 council members elected from the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Inverness, Nairn and Badenoch and Strathspey corporate management area]].\n\nThe city area has the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Nairn ward-level management area]] to the east, the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Badenoch and Strathspey ward-level management area]] to the east and south, the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Ross, Skye and Lochaber corporate management area]] to the south, west and north, and the [[Moray Firth]] to the north.\n\nThe city area is similar but not identical to the former district of Inverness.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Ward<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/yourcouncil/yourward/ |title=Your Ward |publisher=Highland Council website |accessdate=8 April 2008 }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" | Seats\n! scope=\"col\" | Ward-level management area\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Aird and Loch Ness\n| Includes [[Loch Ness]], the town of [[Beauly]], and the village of [[Fort Augustus]] <br/> [[Aird, Inverness|Aird]] is a former district of the [[county of Inverness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 1, covering the Aird and Loch Ness ward and a southern portion of the Inverness South ward\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Culloden and Ardersier\n| Includes the villages of [[Culloden, Highland|Culloden]], [[Ardersier]] and [[Smithton, Inverness|Smithton]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 4, covering the Culloden and Ardersier ward and a northern portion of the Inverness South ward\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness Central\n| Includes [[Dalneigh]], Glebe, Haugh, [[Merkinch]] and [[South Kessock]] areas of urban [[Inverness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 3, covering the two wards of Inverness Central and Inverness Millburn\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness Millburn\n| Includes [[Millburn, Inverness|Millburn]], Culcabock, [[Longman, Inverness|Longman]] and Raigmore areas of urban [[Inverness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| City area 3, covering the two wards of Inverness Central and Inverness Millburn\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness Ness-side\n| Includes Drummond, [[Hilton, Inverness-shire|Hilton]] and Lochardil areas of [[Inverness]], and a more rural area, east of the [[River Ness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 2, covering the two wards of Inverness Ness-side and Inverness West\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness South\n| Includes [[Cradlehall]], Inshes and [[Westhill, Inverness|Westhill]] areas in or near urban [[Inverness]], and the village of [[Tomatin]], on the [[River Findhorn]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| Divided between city area 1, covering the Aird and Loch Ness ward and a southern portion of the Inverness South ward, and city area 4, covering the Culloden and Ardersier ward and a northern portion of the Inverness South ward\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness West\n| Includes [[Kinmylies]] and Scorguie areas of urban [[Inverness]], and a more rural area, west of the [[River Ness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| City area 2, covering the two wards of Inverness Ness-side and Inverness West\n|}\n{{-}}\n\n==Civil parishes==\n[[File:INVERNESS SHIRE map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Inverness-shire]]\n\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them.

constituency)|Inverness-shire constituency]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]) from 1708 to 1801 and of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (also at Westminster) from 1801 to 1918. The constituency represented, nominally, the county of Inverness minus the [[parliamentary burgh of Inverness]], which was represented as a component of the [[Inverness Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness District of Burghs]] constituency.\n\nIn 1918 the county constituency was divided between two new constituencies, the [[Inverness (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness constituency]] and the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles constituency]]. The Inverness constituency included the burgh of Inverness, other components of the [[district of burghs]] being divided between the [[Moray and Nairn (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray and Nairn constituency]] and the [[Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)|Ross and Cromarty constituency]].\n\nIn 1983, eight years after the local government county of Inverness had been divided between the [[Highland (local government area)|Highland]] region and the [[Western Isles]] council area, three new constituencies were created to cover the Highland region. The region, until 1996, and the unitary Highland council area, 1996 to present, have been covered by three constituencies since then but there were changes to boundaries and names in 1997 and 2005.\n\nIn 1999 the areas of the Westminster constituencies became also constituencies of the [[Scottish Parliament]] ([[Scottish Parliament Building|Holyrood]]).

Covering much of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and [[Outer Hebrides]], it is Scotland's largest county, though one of the smallest in population, with 67,733 people or 1.34% of the Scottish population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-towns.net/scotland/highland/invernesshire |title=The Area of Invernesshire |work=British Towns and Villages Network |date=28 September 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe extent of the lieutenancy area was defined in 1975 as covering the [[local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|districts]] of Inverness, [[Badenoch and Strathspey (local government district, Highland region)|Badenoch & Strathspey]], and [[Lochaber (local government district, Highland region)|Lochaber]].{{fact|date=November 2019}} Thus it differs from the county in that it includes parts of what were once [[County of Moray|Moray]] and [[Banffshire]], but does not include any of the [[Outer Hebrides]] which were given their own lieutenancy area \u2014 the [[Western Isles]].{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Stag at Loch Quoich - geograph.org.uk - 1805611.jpg|thumb|right|Loch Quoich]]\n[[File:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Nevis, Britain's tallest mountain]]\nInverness-shire is Scotland's largest county, and the second largest in the UK as a whole after [[Yorkshire]]. It borders [[Ross-shire]] to the north, [[Nairnshire]], [[County of Moray|Moray]], [[Banffshire]] and [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the east, and [[Perthshire]] and [[Argyllshire]] to the south.\n\nIts mainland section covers a large area of the [[Highlands]], bordering the [[Sea of the Hebrides]] to the west and [[Beauly Firth]] and [[Moray Firth]] to the east which provide access to the [[North Sea]]. It is split into two by the [[Great Glen]], a roughly 60 mile [[Great Glen Fault|geological fault]] which runs south-west to north-east and divides the [[Northwest Highlands]] to the west from the [[Grampian Mountains]] (including the [[Monadhliath Mountains]]) to the east. The glen contain the notable lochs of [[Loch Ness]] (Scotland's second largest), [[Loch Oich]] and [[Loch Lochy]], which are connected by the [[Caledonian Canal]]; it opens into the south-west into the sealoch [[Loch Linnhe]]. [[Ben Nevis]], the tallest peak in Britain, is located to the east of Fort William. The west coast consists of a number of large peninsulas divided by long loch inlets; north-to-south these are [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]] (shared with Ross-shire), [[Loch Hourn]], [[Knoydart]], [[Loch Nevis]], North and South [[Morar]]/[[Arisaig]], [[Loch nan Uamh]], [[Ardnish]], [[Loch Ailort]], [[Moidart]] and [[Loch Moidart]]. This area was traditionally referred to as the [[Rough Bounds]] due to its remoteness and inaccessibility and it remains wild and sparseley populated today. The terrain in Inverness-shire is generally mountainous, with numerous lochs scattered throughout the county, the largest of these being: [[Loch Ashie]], [[Loch Mhor]], [[Loch Knockie]], [[Loch Duntelchaig]], [[Loch Ruthven]], [[Loch Moy]], [[Loch Alvie]], [[Loch Insh]], [[Loch an Eilean]], [[Loch Killin]], [[Loch Crunachdan]], [[Loch Morlich]], [[Loch Garten]], [[Loch Einich]], [[Loch an t-Seilich]], [[Loch na Cuaich]], [[Loch Coaldair]], the [[Blackwater Reservoir]], [[Loch Treig]], [[Loch Ossian]], [[Loch Laggan]], [[Loch Spean]], [[Loch Ericht]], [[Loch Gulbin]], [[Lochan na h-Earba]], [[Loch Pattack]], [[Loch Eilde M\u00f2r]], [[Loch a' Bhealaich Bheithe]], [[Loch a' Bhealaich Leamhain]], [[Lochan L\u00f9nn D\u00e0-Bhr\u00e0]], [[Loch Bruicaich]], [[Loch Meiklie]], [[Loch ma Stac]], [[Loch a' Chr\u00e0thaich]], [[Loch na Beinne Baine]], [[Loch Lundie]], [[Loch Garry]], [[Loch Beannacharan]], [[Loch Beinn a Mheadhoin]], [[Loch Monar]], [[Loch Mullardoch]], [[Loch Affric]], [[Loch Cluanie]], [[Loch Loyne]], [[Loch Quoich]], [[Loch an Dubh-Lochain]], [[Loch Arkaig]], [[Loch Morar]], [[Loch Beoriad]], [[Loch Dhoire a' Ghearrain]] and [[Loch Shiel]].\n\nInverness-shire contains numerous small islands off its west coast which form part of the [[Inner Hebrides]]. The largest of these is [[Skye]], separated from the Inverness-shire mainland by the [[Sound of Sleat]]; popular with tourists, it is a huge, sprawling island - the second biggest in Scotland - containing numerous peninsulas and offshore islands. The small isle of [[Eigg]] is also within Inverness-shire, despite the other [[Small Isles]] being in Argyllshire. To the west, across the [[Little Minch]], most of the [[Outer Hebrides]] fall within the county, with the notable exception of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] which is in Ross-shire. Further west still lie the remote islands of [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], which have been uninhabited since 1930. Much further west, 230 miles from the Outer Hebrides, lies the extremely remote, uninhabitable island of [[Rockall]], which is subject to a territorial dispute with [[Ireland]].\n\n===Islands===\n*[[An t-Eilean Meadhoin]]\n*[[Brinacory Island]]\n*[[Eilean a' Ghiuthais]]\n*[[Eilean a' Phidhir]]\n*[[Eilean B\u00e0n]]\n*[[Eilean Choinneach]]\n*[[Eilean nam

a stag's head and in sinister chief a bull's head both erased, and in base a galley, sails furled, oars in action and flagged, all Or. Beneath the shield an escrol bearing this motto: ''{{lang|gd|Air son Math na Siorrachd}}''.\n\nThe galley represents [[Clan Chattan]], who aligned themselves under the banner of [[Somerled|Somerled, Lord of the Isles]]. The stag's head comes from the crest of the Frasers of Lovat, while the bull's head comes from the crest of the MacLeods of that Ilk. The motto is in Gaelic and means \"For the Good of the County\".\n\n==Local government==\n===1890\u20131975===\nInverness-shire acquired a [[county council]] in 1890, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], and, under the same legislation, boundaries were altered to make the county a single contiguous area, transferring several exclaves of other counties to Inverness-shire.\n\nAlthough the new boundaries were supposed to be valid for all purposes (unlike earlier boundaries, which were really default boundaries and not necessarily those used for any particular purpose), the burghs of Inverness, [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]], [[Kingussie]], which had their own town councils, retained autonomous status and were for some purposes beyond the writ of the new county council. The town of Inverness had been established as a [[royal burgh]] since the mid 12th century, Fort William, originally a Fort of that name built by the Government to keep the Highlanders in their place, around which grew up a village which became in turn Gordonsburgh, Maryburgh, Duncansburgh and latterly the town/burgh of Fort William which had been established as a [[burgh of barony]] since 1618 and [[Kingussie]] had been established as a burgh of barony since 1464. Also, use of the new boundaries for parliamentary elections was specifically excluded.\n\n===1975\u20131996===\nThe old county councils were abolished by the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] and Scotland was instead governed by a two-tier system of regions and districts. Mainland Inverness-shire was split amongst four districts of the [[Highland region]], whilst the county's territory in the Outer Hebrides was transferred to the [[Western Isles]] council area.\n\n* 1. The burgh of Inverness and the Aird and Inverness districts were merged to form the [[Inverness]] Local Government district of the Highland region.\n* 2. The burgh of Fort William and the Lochaber district were merged with areas from the [[county of Argyll]] (the Ardnamurchan district and the electoral divisions of Ballachulish and Kinlochleven) to form the [[Lochaber (local government district, Highland region)|Lochaber]] district of the Highland region.\n* 3. The Skye district was merged with an area from the [[county of Ross and Cromarty]] (the South West district) to form the [[Skye and Lochalsh (local government district, Highland region)|Skye and Lochalsh]] district of the Highland region.\n* 4. The [[burgh of Kingussie]] and the Badenoch district were merged with areas from the [[county of Moray]] (the [[burgh of Grantown-on-Spey]] and the Cromdale district) to form the [[Badenoch and Strathspey (local government district, Highland region)|Badenoch and Strathspey]] district of the Highland region.\n* The Barra, Harris, North Uist, and South Uist districts were merged with areas from the county of [[Ross and Cromarty]] (the [[burgh of Stornoway]] and Lewis district) to form the Western Isles council area.\n\nWithin the Highland region, local government functions were divided between the regional council and the district councils. For example, education was a regional responsibility, and housing was a district responsibility.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\nIn 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the two-tier system was abolished and the [[Highland (local government area)|Highland]] region became a [[unitary council area]].\n\nThe new unitary [[Highland Council]] adopted the areas of the former districts as [[politics of the Highland council area|management areas]]. Each management area was represented, initially, by [[area committee]]s consisting of [[councillor]]s elected from areas (groups of local government [[ward (politics)|ward]]s) corresponding to the management areas, but changes to ward boundaries in 1999 created a mismatch between committee areas and management areas.\n\nIn 2007, at the time of further changes to ward boundaries, which created 22 multi-member wards instead of 80 single-member wards, the council created a new management structure, with three new [[Politics of the Highland council area|corporate management area]]s and 16 new [[politics of the Highland council area|ward-level management area]]s. Also, four of the ward-level management areas, covering the seven wards, were grouped to form an Inverness city (or ''Inverness and Area'') management area.\n\nThe total number of Highland councillors is 80, elected by the [[single transferable vote system]] of election, which is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]]. Wards in the Inverness city area elect 26 of the 34 council members elected from the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Inverness, Nairn and Badenoch and Strathspey corporate management area]].\n\nThe city area has the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Nairn ward-level management area]] to the east, the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Badenoch and Strathspey ward-level management area]] to the east and south, the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Ross, Skye and Lochaber corporate management area]] to the south, west and north, and the [[Moray Firth]] to the north.\n\nThe city area is similar but not identical to the former district of Inverness.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Ward<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/yourcouncil/yourward/ |title=Your Ward |publisher=Highland Council website |accessdate=8 April 2008 }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" | Seats\n! scope=\"col\" | Ward-level management area\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Aird and Loch Ness\n| Includes [[Loch Ness]], the town of [[Beauly]], and the village of [[Fort Augustus]] <br/> [[Aird, Inverness|Aird]] is a former district of the [[county of Inverness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 1, covering the Aird and Loch Ness ward and a southern portion of the Inverness South ward\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Culloden and Ardersier\n| Includes the villages of [[Culloden, Highland|Culloden]], [[Ardersier]] and [[Smithton, Inverness|Smithton]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 4, covering the Culloden and Ardersier ward and a northern portion of the Inverness South ward\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness Central\n| Includes [[Dalneigh]], Glebe, Haugh, [[Merkinch]] and [[South Kessock]] areas of urban [[Inverness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 3, covering the two wards of Inverness Central and Inverness Millburn\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness Millburn\n| Includes [[Millburn, Inverness|Millburn]], Culcabock, [[Longman, Inverness|Longman]] and Raigmore areas of urban [[Inverness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| City area 3, covering the two wards of Inverness Central and Inverness Millburn\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness Ness-side\n| Includes Drummond, [[Hilton, Inverness-shire|Hilton]] and Lochardil areas of [[Inverness]], and a more rural area, east of the [[River Ness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| City area 2, covering the two wards of Inverness Ness-side and Inverness West\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness South\n| Includes [[Cradlehall]], Inshes and [[Westhill, Inverness|Westhill]] areas in or near urban [[Inverness]], and the village of [[Tomatin]], on the [[River Findhorn]]\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| Divided between city area 1, covering the Aird and Loch Ness ward and a southern portion of the Inverness South ward, and city area 4, covering the Culloden and Ardersier ward and a northern portion of the Inverness South ward\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inverness West\n| Includes [[Kinmylies]] and Scorguie areas of urban [[Inverness]], and a more rural area, west of the [[River Ness]]\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| City area 2, covering the two wards of Inverness Ness-side and Inverness West\n|}\n{{-}}\n\n==Civil parishes==\n[[File:INVERNESS SHIRE map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Inverness-shire]]\n\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them.

constituency)|Inverness-shire constituency]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]) from 1708 to 1801 and of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (also at Westminster) from 1801 to 1918. The constituency represented, nominally, the county of Inverness minus the [[parliamentary burgh of Inverness]], which was represented as a component of the [[Inverness Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness District of Burghs]] constituency.\n\nIn 1918 the county constituency was divided between two new constituencies, the [[Inverness (UK Parliament constituency)|Inverness constituency]] and the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles constituency]]. The Inverness constituency included the burgh of Inverness, other components of the [[district of burghs]] being divided between the [[Moray and Nairn (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray and Nairn constituency]] and the [[Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)|Ross and Cromarty constituency]].\n\nIn 1983, eight years after the local government county of Inverness had been divided between the [[Highland (local government area)|Highland]] region and the [[Western Isles]] council area, three new constituencies were created to cover the Highland region.

By demonstrating his ability to resolve the issue peacefully, Wang has improved his reputation within the Party as a peacemaker who listens and responds to the interests of the people that he serves.<ref name=\"ewing1\" />\n\nThe citizens of Wukan welcomed intervention by Wang's government, and Wang has capitalized on the popularity of his approach since late December 2011. In a meeting with the Guangdong Party congress in January 2012, Wang pledged to use his \"Wukan approach\" to improve village politics throughout the province. Wang, commenting on his resolution of the protests, has stated that it \"was not only meant to solve problems in the village, but also to set a reference standard to reform village governance across Guangdong.\"<ref name=\"ewing1\" />\n\n== Protests in 2016 ==\nVillagers began marching in protest daily since mid-June 2016 after the arrest of protest leader Lin Zulian (formerly known as Lin Zuluan), an elected leader of the village. Lin, 72, had written a letter to the village on March 2 complaining of continued corruption. Seized land had been \"raped by power, money, and gangsters,\" he wrote. This protest letter followed multiple attempts to gain redress from direct contact with the developer, Hua Hui Real Estate, that had acquired a 110,000 square meter plot of land in Wukan without the approval of the village committee. The company gave a perfunctory response, and the Lufeng government, in which Wukan resides, later stated that the land did not belong to the villagers. On June 18, after calls for \"renewed mass protests\" over land seizures, Lin was arrested by special police who broke into his walled house in the middle of the night.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/03/hopes-for-democracy-crushed-in-the-chinese-rebel-village-of-wukan/|title=Hopes for democracy crushed in the Chinese rebel village of Wukan|last=Reuters|date=2016-07-03|website=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn an enquiry about the land deal and treatment of Lin, the Lufeng government said that it \"has not discovered any situation of unfair suppression or punishment.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLin later appeared on state TV admitting that he had taken bribes for government contracts.

In a meeting with the Guangdong Party congress in January 2012, Wang pledged to use his \"Wukan approach\" to improve village politics throughout the province. Wang, commenting on his resolution of the protests, has stated that it \"was not only meant to solve problems in the village, but also to set a reference standard to reform village governance across Guangdong.\"<ref name=\"ewing1\" />\n\n== Protests in 2016 ==\nVillagers began marching in protest daily since mid-June 2016 after the arrest of protest leader Lin Zulian (formerly known as Lin Zuluan), an elected leader of the village. Lin, 72, had written a letter to the village on March 2 complaining of continued corruption. Seized land had been \"raped by power, money, and gangsters,\" he wrote. This protest letter followed multiple attempts to gain redress from direct contact with the developer, Hua Hui Real Estate, that had acquired a 110,000 square meter plot of land in Wukan without the approval of the village committee. The company gave a perfunctory response, and the Lufeng government, in which Wukan resides, later stated that the land did not belong to the villagers. On June 18, after calls for \"renewed mass protests\" over land seizures, Lin was arrested by special police who broke into his walled house in the middle of the night.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/03/hopes-for-democracy-crushed-in-the-chinese-rebel-village-of-wukan/|title=Hopes for democracy crushed in the Chinese rebel village of Wukan|last=Reuters|date=2016-07-03|website=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn an enquiry about the land deal and treatment of Lin, the Lufeng government said that it \"has not discovered any situation of unfair suppression or punishment.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLin later appeared on state TV admitting that he had taken bribes for government contracts.

Like many other bacterial transposons, Tn7 transposes at low-frequency and inserts into many different sites with little to no site-selectivity. Through this first pathway, Tn7 is preferentially directed into conjugable [[plasmids]], which can be replicated and distributed between bacteria.

This specific sequence is an essential and highly conserved gene found in many strains of bacteria. However, the recombination is not deleterious to the host bacterium as Tn7 actually transposes downstream of the gene after recognizing it, resulting in a safe way to propagate the transposon without killing the host. This highly evolved and sophisticated target-site selection pathway suggests this pathway evolved to promote coexistance between the transposon and it host, as well as Tn7's successful transmission into future generations of bacterium.<ref name =\"Monika\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters J, Craig NL | title = Tn7: smarter than we thought.| journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 806-814 | date = Nov 2001 | pmid = 11715047| doi = 10.1038/35099006}}</ref>\n\nThe Tn7 transponson is 14 kb long and codes for five enzymes.<ref name =\"Monika\" /> The ends of the DNA sequence consists of two segments that the Tn7 transposase interacts with during recombination. The left segment (Tn7-L) is 150 bp long and the right sequence (Tn7-R) is 90 bp long. Both ends of the transposon contain a series of 22 bp binding sites that the Tn7 transposase recognizes and binds to. Within the transposon are five discrete genes encoding for proteins that make up the transposition machinery. In addition, the transposon contains an [[integron]], a DNA segment containing several [[gene cassette|cassettes]] of genes encoding for antibiotic-resistance. <ref name=\"Monika\" />\n\t\nThe Tn7 transposon codes for five proteins: TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TnsD, and TnsE.<ref name=\"Monika\" /> TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the Tn7 transposase enzyme TnsAB. The enzyme specifically recognizes and binds to the ends of the DNA sequence of the transposon, and excises it by introducing double-stranded DNA breaks to each end. The excised sequence is then inserted to another target DNA site. Much like other characterized transposons, the mechanism for Tn7 transposition involves cleavage of the 3' ends from the donating DNA by the TnsA protein of the TnsAB transposase. However, Tn7 is also uniquely cleaved near the 5' ends, about 5 bp from the 5' end towards the Tn7 transposon, by the TnsB protein of TnsAB. After the insertion of the transposon into the target DNA site, the 3' ends are covalently linked to the target DNA, but the 5 bp gaps are still present at the 5' ends. As a result, repair of these gaps leads to a further 5 bp duplication at the target site. The TnsC protein interacts with the transposase enzyme and the target DNA to promote the excision and insertion processes. The ability of TnsC to activate the transposase depends on its interaction with a target DNA along with its appropriate targeting protein, TnsD or TnsE. The TnsD and TnsE proteins are alternative target selectors that are also DNA binding [[activator (genetics)|activators]] that promote excision and insertion of Tn7.  Their ability to interact with a particular target DNA is key to the target-site selection of Tn7. The proteins TnsA, TnsB, and TnsC thus form the core machinery of Tn7: TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the transposase, while TnsC functions as a [[regulator gene|regulator]] of the transposase's activity, communicating between the transposase and TnsD and TnsE.  When the TnsE protein interacts with the TnsABC core machinery, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions into conjugable plasmids. When the TnsD protein interacts with TnsABC, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions downstream into a single essential and highly conserved site in the bacterial chromosome. This site, attTn7, is specifically recognized by TnsD. <ref name=\"Monika\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MeshName|Transposases}}\n* {{PDBe-KB2|Q46731|Transposase for transposon Tn5}}\n\n\n{{Kinases}}\n{{Enzymes}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology|border=no}}\n\n[[Category:EC 2.7.7]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n", "text_old": "'''Transposase''' is an [[enzyme]] that binds to the end of a [[transposon]] and catalyses its movement to another part of the [[genome]] by a cut and paste mechanism or a replicative transposition mechanism. \nThe word \"transposase\" was first coined by the individuals who cloned the enzyme required for transposition of the [[Tn3 Transposon|Tn3 transposon]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heffron F, McCarthy BJ, Ohtsubo H, Ohtsubo E | title = DNA sequence analysis of the transposon Tn3: three genes and three sites involved in transposition of Tn3 | journal = Cell | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 1153\u201363 | date = December 1979 | pmid = 391406 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(79)90228-9 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The existence of transposons was postulated in the late 1940s by [[Barbara McClintock]], who was studying the inheritance of [[maize]], but the actual molecular basis for transposition was described by later groups.

Like many other bacterial transposons, Tn7 transposes at low-frequency and inserts into many different sites with little to no site-selectivity. Through this first pathway, Tn7 is preferentially directed into conjugable [[plasmids]], which can be replicated and distributed between bacteria. However, Tn7 is unique in that it also transposes at high-frequency into a single specific site in bacterial chromosomes called attTn7 <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gringauz E, Orle KA, Waddell CS, Craig NL | title = Recognition of Escherichia coli attTn7 by transposon Tn7: lack of specific sequence requirements at the point of Tn7 insertion.| journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 170 | issue = 6 | pages = 2832-2840 | date = Jun 1988 | pmid = 2836374| doi = 10.1128/jb.170.6.2832-2840.1988 | pmc = 211210}}</ref>. This specific sequence is an essential and highly conserved gene found in many strains of bacteria. However, the recombination is not deleterious to the host bacterium as Tn7 actually transposes downstream of the gene after recognizing it, resulting in a safe way to propagate the transposon without killing the host. This highly evolved and sophisticated target-site selection pathway suggests this pathway evolved to promote coexistance between the transposon and it host, as well as Tn7's successful transmission into future generations of bacterium.<ref name =\"Monika\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters J, Craig NL | title = Tn7: smarter than we thought.| journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 806-814 | date = Nov 2001 | pmid = 11715047| doi = 10.1038/35099006}}</ref>\n\nThe Tn7 transponson is 14 kb long and codes for five enzymes.<ref name =\"Monika\" /> The ends of the DNA sequence consists of two segments that the Tn7 transposase interacts with during recombination. The left segment (Tn7-L) is 150 bp long and the right sequence (Tn7-R) is 90 bp long. Both ends of the transposon contain a series of 22 bp binding sites that the Tn7 transposase recognizes and binds to. Within the transposon are five discrete genes encoding for proteins that make up the transposition machinery. In addition, the transposon contains an [[integron]], a DNA segment containing several [[gene cassette|cassettes]] of genes encoding for antibiotic-resistance. <ref name=\"Monika\" />\n\t\nThe Tn7 transposon codes for five proteins: TnsA, TnsB, TnsC, TnsD, and TnsE.<ref name=\"Monika\" /> TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the Tn7 transposase enzyme TnsAB. The enzyme specifically recognizes and binds to the ends of the DNA sequence of the transposon, and excises it by introducing double-stranded DNA breaks to each end. The excised sequence is then inserted to another target DNA site. Much like other characterized transposons, the mechanism for Tn7 transposition involves cleavage of the 3' ends from the donating DNA by the TnsA protein of the TnsAB transposase. However, Tn7 is also uniquely cleaved near the 5' ends, about 5 bp from the 5' end towards the Tn7 transposon, by the TnsB protein of TnsAB. After the insertion of the transposon into the target DNA site, the 3' ends are covalently linked to the target DNA, but the 5 bp gaps are still present at the 5' ends. As a result, repair of these gaps leads to a further 5 bp duplication at the target site. The TnsC protein interacts with the transposase enzyme and the target DNA to promote the excision and insertion processes. The ability of TnsC to activate the transposase depends on its interaction with a target DNA along with its appropriate targeting protein, TnsD or TnsE. The TnsD and TnsE proteins are alternative target selectors that are also DNA binding [[activator (genetics)|activators]] that promote excision and insertion of Tn7.  Their ability to interact with a particular target DNA is key to the target-site selection of Tn7. The proteins TnsA, TnsB, and TnsC thus form the core machinery of Tn7: TnsA and TnsB interact together to form the transposase, while TnsC functions as a [[regulator gene|regulator]] of the transposase's activity, communicating between the transposase and TnsD and TnsE.  When the TnsE protein interacts with the TnsABC core machinery, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions into conjugable plasmids. When the TnsD protein interacts with TnsABC, Tn7 preferentially directs insertions downstream into a single essential and highly conserved site in the bacterial chromosome. This site, attTn7, is specifically recognized by TnsD. <ref name=\"Monika\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MeshName|Transposases}}\n* {{PDBe-KB2|Q46731|Transposase for transposon Tn5}}\n\n\n{{Kinases}}\n{{Enzymes}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology|border=no}}\n\n[[Category:EC 2.7.7]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n", "name_user": "Orenburg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposase"}

His first documentary, ''The Blood of Beasts'' ([[French-language|French]]: ''Le Sang des B\u00eates'') was a graphic film of a day inside a Paris [[slaughterhouse]]. The second documentary, commissioned by the government in 1950, was ''Passing By the Lorraine'' (French: ''En Passant par la Lorraine''). The film was commissioned as a celebration of the modernization of the French industry, but Franju's film showed his view of the ugliness spewing forth from monstrous factories.

His second feature was the [[horror film]] ''[[Eyes Without a Face]]'' (French:''Les Yeux sans Visage'') about a surgeon who tries to repair his daughter's ruined face by grafting on to it the faces of beautiful women. His 1963 film ''[[Judex (1963 film)|Judex]]'' was a tribute to the silent [[film serial]]s ''[[Judex]]'' and ''[[Fantomas]]''. In Franju's later years his film work became less frequent.

Murnau|Murnau]]\".<ref name=\"Ince7\">Ince, 2005. p.7</ref> Franju's focus was on the visual aspect of filmmaking, which he claimed marked a director as an [[auteur]]. Franju claimed to \"not have the story writing gift\" and was focused on what he described as the \"putting into form\" of the film.<ref name=\"Ince8\">Ince, 2005. p.8</ref>\n\nFranju used elements of surrealism and shock horror within his films in order to \"awaken\" his audience.  Franju had a long history of friendship with well-known surrealists including [[Andre Breton|Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and the influence of this movement is extremely evident in his works.  Franju uses these elements to link horror, history, and an ironic commentary on modernity\u2019s ideal of progress. Franju is quoted as having said \"It\u2019s the bad combination, it\u2019s the wrong synthesis, constantly being made by the eye as it looks around, that stops us from seeing everything as strange.\" Throughout his documentary ''Le Sang des b\u00eates'', for example, Franju reminds the audience just how strange everyday life can be. The opening sequence of the film presents the modern age as a \"dream land\" in which there is a need for some sort of awakening; Franju\u2019s awakening comes through historical knowledge. Surrealist depictions of strange mannequins on the city\u2019s edge are reminiscent of the bodies of the men wounded in war. [[Walter Benjamin]] argued that surrealism must \"disturb capitalist culture\u2019s mythic assumptions of a rationalized evolving history\u201d which is done by provoking a simultaneous interpretation of the past and the present.  This, as Benjamin argues, relies on the recognition of horror within everyday life.  Franju does this in many ways throughout ''Le Sang des b\u00eates''.  For example, \"La Mer\" plays during a sequence in the slaughterhouse, comparing the lyrics to aspects of the slaughter, forcing the audience to interpret the love song in new and horrific ways. A similar contradiction can be seen in the film during scenes in which voiceover narration is used. The use of voiceover in the film works to undermine the form of a more typical documentary film. By alternating male and female narrators, the clinical, typically masculine authority of the documentary film is undermined.  During the scene in which the instruments of slaughter are examined, the contradiction between the clinical account of the use of the instruments and the visceral horror of the instruments themselves points out the horrors that are ignored by modern society. \n\nThe same is true of Fanju\u2019s most famous film, ''Les Yeux sans visage'', which also uses aspects of the scientific documentary film to accentuate horror. ''Les Yeux sans visage'' proved so horrific that audience members in Edinburgh fainted during screenings. During the most graphic grafting scene in the film a large importance is placed on surgical lamps, the scalpel being used, gloves, masks, and operating tables. Once again, the contradiction between the methodical, scientific approach to this horrific situation and the situation itself serves to accentuate the horror.  ''Les Yeux sans visage'' also uses surrealist elements to address aspects of post-war life. During one scene, loud, disrupting noises of an airplane and church bells are heard while Dr. Genessier and Louise bury a failed facial graft candidate. This scene serves to portray the loss of faith in medicine (represented by the body created by another of Dr. Genessier\u2019s many failed attempts to complete this surgery), the progress of technology (represented by the airplane), and the comfort of religion (represented by the church bells). This surrealist combination forces a new view of modernity and thus a reevaluation of the past.<ref>Lowenstein, Adam. \"Films Without a Face: Shock Horror in the Cinema of Georges Franju.\" Cinema Journal 37.4 (1998): 37-58.

Franju uses these elements to link horror, history, and an ironic commentary on modernity\u2019s ideal of progress. Franju is quoted as having said \"It\u2019s the bad combination, it\u2019s the wrong synthesis, constantly being made by the eye as it looks around, that stops us from seeing everything as strange.\" Throughout his documentary ''Le Sang des b\u00eates'', for example, Franju reminds the audience just how strange everyday life can be. The opening sequence of the film presents the modern age as a \"dream land\" in which there is a need for some sort of awakening; Franju\u2019s awakening comes through historical knowledge. Surrealist depictions of strange mannequins on the city\u2019s edge are reminiscent of the bodies of the men wounded in war. [[Walter Benjamin]] argued that surrealism must \"disturb capitalist culture\u2019s mythic assumptions of a rationalized evolving history\u201d which is done by provoking a simultaneous interpretation of the past and the present.  This, as Benjamin argues, relies on the recognition of horror within everyday life.  Franju does this in many ways throughout ''Le Sang des b\u00eates''.  For example, \"La Mer\" plays during a sequence in the slaughterhouse, comparing the lyrics to aspects of the slaughter, forcing the audience to interpret the love song in new and horrific ways. A similar contradiction can be seen in the film during scenes in which voiceover narration is used. The use of voiceover in the film works to undermine the form of a more typical documentary film. By alternating male and female narrators, the clinical, typically masculine authority of the documentary film is undermined.  During the scene in which the instruments of slaughter are examined, the contradiction between the clinical account of the use of the instruments and the visceral horror of the instruments themselves points out the horrors that are ignored by modern society. \n\nThe same is true of Fanju\u2019s most famous film, ''Les Yeux sans visage'', which also uses aspects of the scientific documentary film to accentuate horror. ''Les Yeux sans visage'' proved so horrific that audience members in Edinburgh fainted during screenings. During the most graphic grafting scene in the film a large importance is placed on surgical lamps, the scalpel being used, gloves, masks, and operating tables. Once again, the contradiction between the methodical, scientific approach to this horrific situation and the situation itself serves to accentuate the horror.  ''Les Yeux sans visage'' also uses surrealist elements to address aspects of post-war life. During one scene, loud, disrupting noises of an airplane and church bells are heard while Dr. Genessier and Louise bury a failed facial graft candidate. This scene serves to portray the loss of faith in medicine (represented by the body created by another of Dr. Genessier\u2019s many failed attempts to complete this surgery), the progress of technology (represented by the airplane), and the comfort of religion (represented by the church bells). This surrealist combination forces a new view of modernity and thus a reevaluation of the past.<ref>Lowenstein, Adam. \"Films Without a Face: Shock Horror in the Cinema of Georges Franju.\" Cinema Journal 37.4 (1998): 37-58.
