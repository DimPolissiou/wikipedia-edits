Claims of \"sorcerer\" witches and \"supernatural\" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.<ref>P\u00f3cs 1999 pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n====Violence related to accusations====\nBelief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger for serious forms of [[violence]], including [[murder]].

Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as \"a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more \"traditional\" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205\u2013206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to \"any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic\".<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.</ref> Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' \"refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism\".<ref>[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].</ref> Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.</ref>\n\n==== Stregheria ====\n{{Main|Stregheria}}\nModern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}</ref>\n\nThe ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===\n{{main|Satanism and Witchcraft}}\nModern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the \"dark side of Christianity\" rather than a branch of Wicca: \u2013 the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}</ref> Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.<ref name=\"Point of Inquiry Interview\">{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=2007-08-10}}</ref>\n\nOrganized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)<ref name=JamesRLewis>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&pg=PA553&lpg=PA553&dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&f=false}}</ref> and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966). After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while \"gnosis\" referred to knowledge, and \"[[Wicca]]\" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that \"the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]\". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.<ref>''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L.

Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} include \"mutterer\" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning \"herb\", and ''hapaleh'', meaning \"using\"). The Greek \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 literally means \"herbalist\" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33\u201335 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:\n{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit,{{efn|The Hebrew word '''{{hebrew|\u05d0\u05b9\u05d1}}''' (''ob''), rendered as ''familiar spirit'' in the translated, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].}} and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

The word in most New Testament translations is \"sorcerer\"/\"sorcery\" rather than \"witch\"/\"witchcraft\".\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\n[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.\n\nHowever, some of the rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah II|Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than \"unclean\" forces) than as witchcraft.\n\nJudaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9\u201310) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).\n\nJudaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{See also|Islam and astrology}}\nDivination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}</ref> Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460|title = MAGIC}}</ref> and explicitly forbid its practice.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Sihr'' translates from [[Arabic]] as black magic.

Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of \"The Grateful foxes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes \u2013 Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or \"hereditary witches\".<ref>Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\n{{Main|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] continues to use the [[death penalty]] for [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|sorcery]] and witchcraft.<ref name= Miethe>{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective |last=Miethe |first=Terance D. |author2=Lu, Hong |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-60516-8 |page=63}}</ref> In 2006 [[Fawza Falih|Fawza Falih Muhammad Ali]] was condemned to death for practicing witchcraft.<ref>\"Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'\", 14 February 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm BBC NEWS]</ref> There is no legal definition of sorcery in Saudi, but in 2007 an Egyptian pharmacist working there was accused, convicted, and executed.

The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe \"[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]\" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers.

''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.</ref> \n\n==== Spells ====\nPagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.\n</ref> One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.</ref> Botanicals should be gathered, \"During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right.\"<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\">Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.</ref>\n\nSpells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\"/> Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.</ref> To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.\n</ref> Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.</ref>\n\nDemonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606\u2013631|doi=10.1017/S0010417503000276}}</ref> Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple\u2014one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.</ref>\n\nWhile these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.<ref>Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.\n</ref> The western concept of an \"evil eye\" or a \"hex\" was translated to Russia as a \"spoiler\".<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.</ref> A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.<ref>Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.\n</ref>\n\n==== Societal view of witchcraft ====\nThe dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a \"whisperer\" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).<ref>\nChristine D. Worobec, 1995. \"Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages.\" Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).</ref>\n\nIronically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers \u2013 but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual's self is often deemed as \"feminine\" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192\u2013194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}</ref>\n\n==== Witchcraft trials ====\n[[File:\"A true and just recorde of the information\"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|upright|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]\n\nWitchcraft trials frequently occurred in seventeenth-century Russia, although the \"[[Witch trials in the early modern period|great witch-hunt]]\" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominantly Western European phenomenon. However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called \"witch hysteria.\" This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community. Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.<ref>\n\nRussell Zguta, \"Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia,\" American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.</ref> Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.<ref>Zguta, 1190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|upright|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: \" [so she must be a witch]\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://archive.org/details/inquisitionunmas02puig|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}</ref>]]\n\nThe sentence for an individual who was found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, as well as in previous centuries, typically included either [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]] or being tested with the \"[[Trial by ordeal#Cold water|ordeal of cold water]]\" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\">Zguta, 1189.</ref> The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but it was also used as a method of truth in Russia both prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them \"brought back,\" but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and they were either burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these two methods of [[torture]] were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century. Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present. In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.<ref>\nZguta, 1187.</ref> By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts\u2014astrology, fortune telling, and divination\u2014became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\">Zguta, 1191.</ref>\n\nTsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547\u20131584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\"/> Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.<ref>Zguta, 1193.</ref> Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565\u20131572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598\u20131613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.<ref>Zguta, 1193\u201394.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the groundwork, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.<ref>Zguta, 1195.</ref> Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.<ref>Zguta, 1196.</ref> Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.\n\n== Witches in art ==\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.<ref>Simons, Patricia. \"THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART.\" Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the \"protectress of childbirth and fertility\" while Herodias symbolized \"unbridled sensuality\". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).<ref>Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).</ref>\n  \nOne of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.<ref>Stumpel, Jeroen. \u201cThe Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in D\u00fcrer's \u2018Four Witches.\u2019\u201d Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143\u2013160., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.</ref>\n  \nD\u00fcrer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as \"[sucking] the blood of newborn infants\"<ref name=\":1\" />) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as \"practitioners of witchcraft and magic\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSubsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an \"earthly alliance\" had taken place between Satan's female minions who \"conspired to destroy Christendom\".<ref name=\":12\">Hoak, Dale. \"THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE.\" ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nAnother significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was D\u00fcrer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.<ref name=\":12\" />Another important artist whose art represented the witches was [[Francisco Goya]] with the series \"Black paintings\" and artists whose contemporary art represents the witches is [[Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier]] who is part of the generation of Basque sculptors who have preserved these beliefs until the XXI century. .The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their \"flight-inducing [powers]\". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neoshamanism ]]\n* [[Modern paganism]]\n* [[Kitchen witch]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Referenced works ==\n* [[Alan Macfarlane]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_in_Tudor_and_Stuart_England.html?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England''], Psychology Press, 1999 (orig. 1970) \n* ''[[University of Kansas]] Publications in Anthropology'', No. 5 = John M Janzen and Wyatt MacGaffey: ''An Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Za\u00efre''.

Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of \"sorcerer\" witches and \"supernatural\" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.<ref>P\u00f3cs 1999 pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n====Violence related to accusations====\nBelief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger for serious forms of [[violence]], including [[murder]].

Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205\u2013206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to \"any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic\".<ref>[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.</ref> Another definition was offered by Daniel A.

Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}</ref>\n\nThe ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals.

After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while \"gnosis\" referred to knowledge, and \"[[Wicca]]\" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that \"the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]\".

In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmake\u00eda'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}}, \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning \"poisoner\", and on this basis, claimed that \"witch\" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.<ref>Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.</ref> His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e3}} include \"mutterer\" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning \"herb\", and ''hapaleh'', meaning \"using\"). The Greek \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 literally means \"herbalist\" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33\u201335 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:\n{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit,{{efn|The Hebrew word '''{{hebrew|\u05d0\u05b9\u05d1}}''' (''ob''), rendered as ''familiar spirit'' in the translated, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].}} and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

The word in most New Testament translations is \"sorcerer\"/\"sorcery\" rather than \"witch\"/\"witchcraft\".\n\n==== Judaism ====\n{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}\n[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.\n\nHowever, some of the rabbis practiced \"magic\" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah II|Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the \"magic\" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than \"unclean\" forces) than as witchcraft.\n\nJudaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9\u201310) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).\n\nJudaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.\n\n==== Islam ====\n{{See also|Islam and astrology}}\nDivination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}</ref> Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460|title = MAGIC}}</ref> and explicitly forbid its practice.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Sihr'' translates from [[Arabic]] as black magic.

Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by \"detecting\" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of \"exorcisms\", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.<ref>Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children].

Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of \"The Grateful foxes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes \u2013 Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or \"hereditary witches\".<ref>Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\n{{Main|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Human rights in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] continues to use the [[death penalty]] for [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|sorcery]] and witchcraft.<ref name= Miethe>{{cite book |title=Punishment: a comparative historical perspective |last=Miethe |first=Terance D. |author2=Lu, Hong |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-60516-8 |page=63}}</ref> In 2006 [[Fawza Falih|Fawza Falih Muhammad Ali]] was condemned to death for practicing witchcraft.<ref>\"Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'\", 14 February 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm BBC NEWS]</ref> There is no legal definition of sorcery in Saudi, but in 2007 an Egyptian pharmacist working there was accused, convicted, and executed.

''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.</ref> \n\n==== Spells ====\nPagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.\n</ref> One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.</ref> Botanicals should be gathered, \"During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right.\"<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\">Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.</ref>\n\nSpells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.<ref name=\"Judika Illes 2004 page 847\"/> Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.</ref> To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.\n</ref> Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.</ref>\n\nDemonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606\u2013631|doi=10.1017/S0010417503000276}}</ref> Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple\u2014one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.<ref>\nJudika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.</ref>\n\nWhile these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.<ref>Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.\n</ref> The western concept of an \"evil eye\" or a \"hex\" was translated to Russia as a \"spoiler\".<ref>Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.</ref> A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler. The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.<ref>Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.\n</ref>\n\n==== Societal view of witchcraft ====\nThe dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a \"whisperer\" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).<ref>\nChristine D. Worobec, 1995. \"Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages.\" Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).</ref>\n\nIronically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers \u2013 but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nThe history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual's self is often deemed as \"feminine\" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192\u2013194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}</ref>\n\n==== Witchcraft trials ====\n[[File:\"A true and just recorde of the information\"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|upright|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]\n\nWitchcraft trials frequently occurred in seventeenth-century Russia, although the \"[[Witch trials in the early modern period|great witch-hunt]]\" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominantly Western European phenomenon. However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called \"witch hysteria.\" This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community. Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.<ref>\n\nRussell Zguta, \"Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia,\" American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.</ref> Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.<ref>Zguta, 1190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|upright|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: \" [so she must be a witch]\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://archive.org/details/inquisitionunmas02puig|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}</ref>]]\n\nThe sentence for an individual who was found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, as well as in previous centuries, typically included either [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]] or being tested with the \"[[Trial by ordeal#Cold water|ordeal of cold water]]\" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\">Zguta, 1189.</ref> The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but it was also used as a method of truth in Russia both prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them \"brought back,\" but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and they were either burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1189\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these two methods of [[torture]] were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century. Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present. In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.<ref>\nZguta, 1187.</ref> By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts\u2014astrology, fortune telling, and divination\u2014became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\">Zguta, 1191.</ref>\n\nTsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547\u20131584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.<ref name=\"Zguta, 1191\"/> Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.<ref>Zguta, 1193.</ref> Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565\u20131572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles. Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598\u20131613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.<ref>Zguta, 1193\u201394.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the groundwork, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.<ref>Zguta, 1195.</ref> Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.<ref>Zguta, 1196.</ref> Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.\n\n== Witches in art ==\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.<ref>Simons, Patricia. \"THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART.\" Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the \"protectress of childbirth and fertility\" while Herodias symbolized \"unbridled sensuality\". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).<ref>Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).</ref>\n  \nOne of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.<ref>Stumpel, Jeroen. \u201cThe Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in D\u00fcrer's \u2018Four Witches.\u2019\u201d Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143\u2013160., https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.</ref>\n  \nD\u00fcrer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as \"[sucking] the blood of newborn infants\"<ref name=\":1\" />) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as \"practitioners of witchcraft and magic\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSubsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an \"earthly alliance\" had taken place between Satan's female minions who \"conspired to destroy Christendom\".<ref name=\":12\">Hoak, Dale. \"THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE.\" ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nAnother significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was D\u00fcrer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.<ref name=\":12\" />Another important artist whose art represented the witches was [[Francisco Goya]] with the series \"Black paintings\" and artists whose contemporary art represents the witches is [[Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier]] who is part of the generation of Basque sculptors who have preserved these beliefs until the XXI century. .The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their \"flight-inducing [powers]\". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Neoshamanism ]]\n* [[Modern paganism]]\n* [[Kitchen witch]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Referenced works ==\n* [[Alan Macfarlane]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Witchcraft_in_Tudor_and_Stuart_England.html?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England''], Psychology Press, 1999 (orig. 1970) \n* ''[[University of Kansas]] Publications in Anthropology'', No. 5 = John M Janzen and Wyatt MacGaffey: ''An Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Za\u00efre''.

Given the city-state's compact size, most venues were pre-existing public-sporting facilities located in the suburban heartlands which were reverted to public use after the games. No major retrofitting work were done in most venues as most had been used to host major multi-disciplinary events such as the [[2010 Youth Olympic Games]].\n\nAt the centrepiece of the activities was the [[Singapore Sports Hub]] which was completed in mid-2014. Incorporating the new 55,000-seat national stadium, it hosted most of the events.\n\nA games village was not built. Instead, a \"village in the city\" concept saw athletes and officials housed in 20 hotels in downtown Singapore. Besides being physically near to the Singapore Sports Hub, it was hoped that it will add vibe to the city and reduce post-games costs in converting a dedicated games village to other uses.\n\nThe '''28th [[Southeast Asian Games]]''' had 30 venues for the games.\n\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:left; font-size:100%; border:2px solid blue;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; color:white; font-weight:bold; background:red;\"\n| Cluster\n| Competition Venue\n| Sports\n|-\n!rowspan=13|[[Kallang|Kallang Cluster]]\n!colspan=2|[[Singapore Sports Hub]]\n|-\n|[[Singapore National Stadium]]\n|Opening & Closing ceremony, Athletics, Football\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 1\n|Netball, Basketball\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 2\n|Fencing, Volleyball (Indoor)\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 4\n|Billiards & snooker\n|-\n|[[Singapore Indoor Stadium]]\n|Table tennis, Badminton\n|-\n|OCBC Aquatic Centre\n|Aquatics: Diving, Swimming, Synchronised swimming, Waterpolo\n|-\n!colspan=2|Other\n|-\n|Kallang Squash Centre\n|Squash: Singles & team\n|-\n|[[Kallang Tennis Centre]]\n|Tennis\n|-\n|Kallang Cricket Field\n|Archery\n|-\n|Kallang Softball Field\n|Softball\n|-\n|Kallang Practice Track\n|Athletics: Marathon\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Singapore Expo]]\n|Expo Hall 1\n|Boxing, Sepaktakraw\n|-\n|Expo Hall 2\n|Judo, Pencak silat, Taekwondo, Wushu\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Marina Cluster\n|[[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]\n|Traditional Boat Race, Sailing: Keelboat\n|-\n|[[Marina South|Marina Bay South]]\n|Cycling\n|-\n|Marina Channel\n|Canoeing, Rowing\n|-\n!rowspan=17|Other\n|-\n| [[Bedok Reservoir]] || Water Ski<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[Bishan Sports Hall]] || Gymnastics\n|-\n| [[Bishan Stadium]] || Football<ref name=\"Competition venues\">{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/tdysports/status/560323615422304256/photo/1 |title=Competition venues for SEA Games |work=Singapore News |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Jalan Besar Stadium]] || Football\n|-\n| [[Choa Chu Kang Stadium]] || Rugby sevens<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[East Coast Park]] ||Athletics: 20&nbsp;km walk, Triathlon\n|-\n| [[ITE College Central|ITE Central]] || Floorball\n|-\n| [[National Sailing Centre]] || Sailing\n|-\n| [[National Shooting Centre]] || Shooting (Outdoors)\n|-\n| Orchid Country Club || Bowling\n|-\n| [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] || P\u00e9tanque\n|-\n| [[Sengkang Hockey Stadium]] || Field hockey\n|-\n| Sentosa Golf Club ||Golf\n|-\n| [[Singapore Turf Club|Turf Club Riding Centre]] || Equestrian\n|-\n| [[Tanglin Club]] || Squash: Jumbo double\n|-\n| SAFRA Yishun || Shooting (Indoors)\n|}\n\n===Public transport===\nGiven the existing extensive public transport network already in place, there is no games-specific major infrastructural development to support it.

was later deemed to be valid after consultation with the chairman as well as with the panel of five jury members. Megat Zulkarnain said that after watching video replays of the drop, the drop should not have counted as Mohd Fauzi was pulled down instead of being dropped legally according to the regulations, and thus Malaysia should have won the match instead. He felt that the eventual decision to award the match to Singapore's Muhd Nur Alfian was just so as to maintain the dignity of the home nation's pencak silat, which was widely criticised by many nations.<ref name=\"malaysia dissatisfaction\"/>\n*During the closing ceremony, spectators were shuffled from gate to gate in order to enter through a gate with fewer people resulting in them not being able to watch the ceremony.

Given the city-state's compact size, most venues were pre-existing public-sporting facilities located in the suburban heartlands which were reverted to public use after the games. No major retrofitting work were done in most venues as most had been used to host major multi-disciplinary events such as the [[2010 Youth Olympic Games]].\n\nAt the centrepiece of the activities was the [[Singapore Sports Hub]] which was completed in mid-2014. Incorporating the new 55,000-seat national stadium, it hosted most of the events.\n\nA games village was not built. Instead, a \"village in the city\" concept saw athletes and officials housed in 20 hotels in downtown Singapore. Besides being physically near to the Singapore Sports Hub, it was hoped that it will add vibe to the city and reduce post-games costs in converting a dedicated games village to other uses.\n\nThe '''28th [[Southeast Asian Games]]''' had 30 venues for the games.\n\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:left; font-size:100%; border:2px solid blue;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; color:white; font-weight:bold; background:red;\"\n| Cluster\n| Competition Venue\n| Sports\n|-\n!rowspan=13|[[Kallang|Kallang Cluster]]\n!colspan=2|[[Singapore Sports Hub]]\n|-\n|[[Singapore National Stadium]]\n|Opening & Closing ceremony, Athletics, Football\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 1\n|Netball, Basketball\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 2\n|Fencing, Volleyball (Indoor)\n|-\n|OCBC Arena Hall 4\n|Billiards & snooker\n|-\n|[[Singapore Indoor Stadium]]\n|Table tennis, Badminton\n|-\n|OCBC Aquatic Centre\n|Aquatics: Diving, Swimming, Synchronised swimming, Waterpolo\n|-\n!colspan=2|Other\n|-\n|Kallang Squash Centre\n|Squash: Singles & team\n|-\n|[[Kallang Tennis Centre]]\n|Tennis\n|-\n|Kallang Cricket Field\n|Archery\n|-\n|Kallang Softball Field\n|Softball\n|-\n|Kallang Practice Track\n|Athletics: Marathon\n|-\n!rowspan=2|[[Singapore Expo]]\n|Expo Hall 1\n|Boxing, Sepaktakraw\n|-\n|Expo Hall 2\n|Judo, Pencak silat, Taekwondo, Wushu\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Marina Cluster\n|[[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]\n|Traditional Boat Race, Sailing: Keelboat\n|-\n|[[Marina South|Marina Bay South]]\n|Cycling\n|-\n|Marina Channel\n|Canoeing, Rowing\n|-\n!rowspan=17|Other\n|-\n| [[Bedok Reservoir]] || Water Ski<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[Bishan Sports Hall]] || Gymnastics\n|-\n| [[Bishan Stadium]] || Football<ref name=\"Competition venues\">{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/tdysports/status/560323615422304256/photo/1 |title=Competition venues for SEA Games |work=Singapore News |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Jalan Besar Stadium]] || Football\n|-\n| [[Choa Chu Kang Stadium]] || Rugby sevens<ref name=\"Competition venues\" />\n|-\n| [[East Coast Park]] ||Athletics: 20&nbsp;km walk, Triathlon\n|-\n| [[ITE College Central|ITE Central]] || Floorball\n|-\n| [[National Sailing Centre]] || Sailing\n|-\n| [[National Shooting Centre]] || Shooting (Outdoors)\n|-\n| Orchid Country Club || Bowling\n|-\n| [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] || P\u00e9tanque\n|-\n| [[Sengkang Hockey Stadium]] || Field hockey\n|-\n| Sentosa Golf Club ||Golf\n|-\n| [[Singapore Turf Club|Turf Club Riding Centre]] || Equestrian\n|-\n| [[Tanglin Club]] || Squash: Jumbo double\n|-\n| SAFRA Yishun || Shooting (Indoors)\n|}\n\n===Public transport===\nGiven the existing extensive public transport network already in place, there is no games-specific major infrastructural development to support it.

Originally opened in 1839, the station is located on the former [[Croydon Canal]], which is now a branch of the [[Brighton Main Line]], often known as the Sydenham Corridor. Sydenham falls within [[Travelcard Zone 3]] and is served by [[London Overground]] and [[Southern (Govia Thameslink Railway)|Southern]]. The station is {{miles-chains|6|mi|32|chain|km}} down the line from {{stn|London Bridge}}.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Croydon, Norwood & Woodside RJD 53.jpg|thumb|left|A 1908 [[Railway Clearing House]] map of lines around the [[Brighton Main Line]] between South Croydon and Selhurst / Forest Hill, as well as surrounding lines]]\n\nThe Croydon Canal opened in 1809 linking the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] to [[Croydon]], however the waterway was never successful, and in 1836, it was the first canal to be abandoned by an [[Act of Parliament]]. The alignment was purchased by the [[London and Croydon Railway]], who drained the canal and re-opened as a railway on the 5 June 1839. In 1844, L&CR was given authority to test the first [[atmospheric railway]] equipment between Dartmouth Arms (now Forest Hill) and West Croydon.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Turner | first= John Howard | year=1978 | title= The London Brighton and South Coast Railway 1 Origins and Formation| publisher=[[Batsford]] | isbn= 0-7134-0275-X |page=250 }}</ref> In 1846, the railway became part of the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] and in the following year, the system was abandoned.

Between 1948 and 1982 Sydenham was part of the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]] and following sectorisation, until privatisation, Sydenham became part of the [[Network SouthEast]] sector. Upon privatisation in May 1996, the station management passed to [[Connex South Central]]. Connex was stripped of the franchise due to poor financial management and in 2001, Govia South Central (Southern) took over the franchise and management of the station. Southern remained the sole train provider until 2010, when London Overground took over management of the station and began running trains as part of the [[East London Line]] extension.\n\nSydenham was the first station to serve the area, however, there are, or have been, five other stations in the Sydenham:\n* {{Stnlnk|Lower Sydenham}} on the [[Hayes Line]]\n* {{Stnlnk|Upper Sydenham}} on the now closed [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace (High Level) line]]\n* {{Stnlnk|Sydenham Hill}}, {{Stnlnk|Penge East}} on the {{LUL stations|station=Victoria}} to [[Orpington]] line.\n\n==Station layout==\nLike all intermediate stations between New Cross Gate and Norwood Junction, Sydenham has two platforms, facing two (up and down slow) of the four tracks with the two fast tracks run between the two slow lines. There are three entrances - the ticket office on platform 2 from Sydenham Station Approach, entrance on platform 1 from Peak Hill Gardens and a gate on platform 2 which is not unlocked regularly. A locally owned small cafe named ''On The Hoof'' which also has locations at other stations on the line, is in the main station building.\n\n==Services==\n{{London Overground East London Line |width=360px |collapse=yes }}\n\nSydenham is served by 8 trains in each direction off peak, with additional Southern services at peak hours. London Overground operates 5 car trains while Southern operates 4-10 car trains throughout the day.\n\nOff Peak frequencies are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Platform\n! Frequency<br>(per hour)\n!

Between 1948 and 1982 Sydenham was part of the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]] and following sectorisation, until privatisation, Sydenham became part of the [[Network SouthEast]] sector. Upon privatisation in May 1996, the station management passed to [[Connex South Central]]. Connex was stripped of the franchise due to poor financial management and in 2001, Govia South Central (Southern) took over the franchise and management of the station. Southern remained the sole train provider until 2010, when London Overground took over management of the station and began running trains as part of the [[East London Line]] extension.\n\nSydenham was the first station to serve the area, however, there are, or have been, five other stations in the Sydenham:\n* {{Stnlnk|Lower Sydenham}} on the [[Hayes Line]]\n* {{Stnlnk|Upper Sydenham}} on the now closed [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace (High Level) line]]\n* {{Stnlnk|Sydenham Hill}}, {{Stnlnk|Penge East}} on the {{LUL stations|station=Victoria}} to [[Orpington]] line.\n\n==Station layout==\nLike all intermediate stations between New Cross Gate and Norwood Junction, Sydenham has two platforms, facing two (up and down slow) of the four tracks with the two fast tracks run between the two slow lines. There are three entrances - the ticket office on platform 2 from Sydenham Station Approach, entrance on platform 1 from Peak Hill Gardens and a gate on platform 2 which is not unlocked regularly. A locally owned small cafe named ''On The Hoof'' which also has locations at other stations on the line, is in the main station building.\n\n==Services==\n{{London Overground East London Line |width=360px |collapse=yes }}\n\nSydenham is served by 8 trains in each direction off peak, with additional Southern services at peak hours.
