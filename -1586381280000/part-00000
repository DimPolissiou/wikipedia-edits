Born and raised in [[Texas]], she made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]'' (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Her first leading role was in the horror film ''[[All the Boys Love Mandy Lane]]'' (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running [[The CW]] television series ''[[Hidden Palms]]'' (2007).\n\nHeard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film ''[[Never Back Down]]'' and in the [[stoner comedy]] ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', which were both box office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at [[Young Hollywood Awards]]. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as ''[[The Informers (2008 film)|The Informers]]'' (2008), ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (2009), ''[[Zombieland]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Joneses]]'' (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite [[Nicolas Cage]] in ''[[Drive Angry]]'', and opposite [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[The Rum Diary (film)|The Rum Diary]]''; neither were critically nor commercially successful. Subsequently, Heard appeared in ''[[3 Days to Kill]]'' (2014), ''[[Magic Mike XXL]]'' (2015) and ''[[The Danish Girl (film)|The Danish Girl]]'' (2015). She also starred in the indie film ''[[The Adderall Diaries (film)|The Adderall Diaries]]'' (2015), the television musical drama ''[[One More Time (2015 film)|One More Time]]'' (2015), and the [[Martin Amis]] adaptation ''[[London Fields (film)|London Fields]]'' (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over disagreements in its editing and other issues. The film was finally released in 2018, and was both a critical and commercial flop.\n\nIn 2017, Heard acted as part of an [[ensemble cast]]\u00a0in the indie film ''[[I Do...Until I Don't]]'' (2017) and made an appearance as [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] in the superhero film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017). She reprised the latter role opposite [[Jason Momoa]]\u00a0in ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), which became the most profitable [[DC Extended Universe]] film up to that point, and the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2018]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2018&p=.htm |title=2018 Yearly Box Office Results |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> The same year, Heard was also named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant [[L'Or\u00e9al Paris]]. In 2019, she appeared in supporting roles in the independent films ''[[Her Smell]]'' and ''[[Gully (film)|Gully]]''.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Heard engages in activism for causes such as [[LGBTQ]] rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness. She is an [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) ambassador and has been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. From 2015 to 2017, Heard was married to her ''The Rum Diary'' co-star [[Johnny Depp]]. Their divorce drew significant media attention, as Heard alleged that Depp had been physically and verbally abusive towards her through most of their relationship. In 2019, he sued her for defamation after she discussed being a victim of domestic violence in the media. He countered that Heard had abused him, which Heard says is not true.\n\n==Early life==\nHeard was born in [[Austin, Texas]], to Patricia Paige (n\u00e9e Parsons), an internet researcher, and David Clinton Heard, who owned a small construction company.<ref name=wonderland>{{cite web|url= https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2019/04/02/amber-heard-spring-19-interview/|title=Amber Heard on her position as a Hollywood voice for justice|work= Wonderland|first=Eve|last=Barlow|date=April 2, 2019|accessdate= May 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=tvg/><ref name=NewsAu>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-amber-heard/story-fnk825aa-1226809741190|title=Five things you need to know about Amber Heard|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}</ref> She has a younger sister named Whitney.<ref name=tvg /><ref name=THRDec2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/amber-heard-aquaman-elon-musk-dedication-activism-1166004|title=Amber Heard on 'Aquaman', Elon Musk, Dedication to Activism|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> The family lived outside Austin.<ref name=glamour2018>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/amber-heard-january-2018-cover-story|title= Amber Heard Is Nobody's Victim|magazine=Glamour|first=Phoebe|last=Reilly|accessdate=April 19, 2019|date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> Heard's father broke horses in his freetime, and she grew up riding horses, hunting, and fishing with him.<ref name=glamour2018/> She also participated in beauty pageants, although as an adult she has stated that she could no longer \"support the objectification\".<ref name=glamour2018/> When Heard was 16, her best friend died in a car crash.

Born and raised in [[Texas]], she made her film debut in a minor supporting role in the sports drama ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]'' (2004), followed by a series of other small roles in television and film. Her first leading role was in the horror film ''[[All the Boys Love Mandy Lane]]'' (2006), but it was not released in the United States until 2013 due to distribution problems. Her second major role came in the short-running [[The CW]] television series ''[[Hidden Palms]]'' (2007).\n\nHeard's breakthrough came in 2008 with roles in the action film ''[[Never Back Down]]'' and in the [[stoner comedy]] ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', which were both box office successes. The same year, she received the Breakthrough Award at [[Young Hollywood Awards]]. Heard continued her career with roles in films such as ''[[The Informers (2008 film)|The Informers]]'' (2008), ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (2009), ''[[Zombieland]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Joneses]]'' (2009). In 2011, she played the female lead opposite [[Nicolas Cage]] in ''[[Drive Angry]]'', and opposite [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[The Rum Diary (film)|The Rum Diary]]''; neither were critically nor commercially successful. Subsequently, Heard appeared in ''[[3 Days to Kill]]'' (2014), ''[[Magic Mike XXL]]'' (2015) and ''[[The Danish Girl (film)|The Danish Girl]]'' (2015). She also starred in the indie film ''[[The Adderall Diaries (film)|The Adderall Diaries]]'' (2015), the television musical drama ''[[One More Time (2015 film)|One More Time]]'' (2015), and the [[Martin Amis]] adaptation ''[[London Fields (film)|London Fields]]'' (2018). The latter was due to be released in 2015, but became the subject of a series of lawsuit between its director, Heard, and the film's production company over disagreements in its editing and other issues. The film was finally released in 2018, and was both a critical and commercial flop.\n\nIn 2017, Heard acted as part of an [[ensemble cast]]\u00a0in the indie film ''[[I Do...Until I Don't]]'' (2017) and made an appearance as [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] in the superhero film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017). She reprised the latter role opposite [[Jason Momoa]]\u00a0in ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), which became the most profitable [[DC Extended Universe]] film up to that point, and the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2018]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2018&p=.htm |title=2018 Yearly Box Office Results |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> The same year, Heard was also named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant [[L'Or\u00e9al Paris]]. In 2019, she appeared in supporting roles in the independent films ''[[Her Smell]]'' and ''[[Gully (film)|Gully]]''.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Heard engages in activism for causes such as [[LGBTQ]] rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness. She is an [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) ambassador and has been named a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. From 2015 to 2017, Heard was married to her ''The Rum Diary'' co-star [[Johnny Depp]]. Their divorce drew significant media attention, as Heard alleged that Depp had been physically and verbally abusive towards her through most of their relationship. In 2019, he sued her for defamation after she discussed being a victim of domestic violence in the media. He countered that Heard had abused him, which Heard says is not true.\n\n==Early life==\nHeard was born in [[Austin, Texas]], to Patricia Paige (n\u00e9e Parsons), an internet researcher, and David Clinton Heard, who owned a small construction company.<ref name=wonderland>{{cite web|url= https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2019/04/02/amber-heard-spring-19-interview/|title=Amber Heard on her position as a Hollywood voice for justice|work= Wonderland|first=Eve|last=Barlow|date=April 2, 2019|accessdate= May 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name=tvg/><ref name=NewsAu>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-amber-heard/story-fnk825aa-1226809741190|title=Five things you need to know about Amber Heard|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}</ref> She has a younger sister named Whitney.<ref name=tvg /><ref name=THRDec2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/amber-heard-aquaman-elon-musk-dedication-activism-1166004|title=Amber Heard on 'Aquaman', Elon Musk, Dedication to Activism|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=December 6, 2018|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> The family lived outside Austin.<ref name=glamour2018>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/amber-heard-january-2018-cover-story|title= Amber Heard Is Nobody's Victim|magazine=Glamour|first=Phoebe|last=Reilly|accessdate=April 19, 2019|date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> Heard's father broke horses in his freetime, and she grew up riding horses, hunting, and fishing with him.<ref name=glamour2018/> She also participated in beauty pageants, although as an adult she has stated that she could no longer \"support the objectification\".<ref name=glamour2018/> When Heard was 16, her best friend died in a car crash.

For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.\n\nThe Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nUnless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}</ref> The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies.

In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

According to the IRSP, 80 people were in attendance.<ref name=PD/> A paramilitary wing, the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA), was founded the same day, although its existence was intended to be kept hidden until such a time that the INLA could operate effectively. Costello was elected as the party's first chairperson and the Army's first chief of staff. Together, the IRSP and the INLA referred to themselves as the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFormer [[Unity (Northern Ireland)|Unity]] MP for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette McAliskey]] served on the executive of the IRSP.<ref>[[Tim Pat Coogan|Coogan, Tim Pat]].

This led to the resignation of half the ''Ard Comhairle'', which weakened the party. [[Tony Gregory]], a future Dublin [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], was also a member for a short time.<ref>[http://www.irishleftreview.org/2009/01/06/tonygregory-1947-2009/ Tony Gregory: 1947 \u2013 2009]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Irish Left Review'', 6 January 2009.</ref> Its poor showing in the [[1977 Irish general election]], and the assassination of Seamus Costello, weakened the organisation.\n\nCostello had been expelled from the [[Official Irish Republican Army]] (OIRA) following a [[court-martial]], and from Official Sinn F\u00e9in on the same basis. Along with other activists, he was dissatisfied with the group's tactics and policies, especially on the issues surrounding the 1972 OIRA ceasefire and his growing belief that the emerging conflict was sectarian.\n\n===Clashes with other republicans and the British===\nIn 1977, Costello was shot dead in his car by a man armed with a shotgun. His supporters blamed the Official IRA for the killing.\n\nFollowing meetings between the INLA and OIRA leadership in Dublin, a truce was eventually reached, but in one of the first of the INLA's armed operations, [[Billy McMillen]], commanding officer of the OIRA Belfast Battalion, was murdered by [[Gerard Steenson]]. In the following years, the IRSP and INLA saw many of their members, including leading members [[Miriam Daly]], [[Ronnie Bunting]] and Noel Little, killed in attacks from British state forces and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries.\n\nThree members of the INLA died in the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]] in [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|HM Prison]] [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze]], also known as Long Kesh: [[Patsy O'Hara]], [[Kevin Lynch (hunger striker)|Kevin Lynch]], and [[Michael Devine (hunger striker)|Michael Devine]].\n\nIn 1987, the INLA and its political wing, the IRSP came under attack from the [[Irish People's Liberation Organisation]] (IPLO), an organisation founded by people who had resigned or been expelled from the INLA. The IPLO's initial aim was to destroy the IRSM and replace it with their organisation. Five members of the INLA and IRSP were killed by the IPLO, including leaders [[Ta Power]] and John O'Reilly. The INLA retaliated with several killings of their own. After the INLA killed the IPLO's leader, [[Gerard Steenson]], a truce was reached. Although severely damaged by the IPLO's attacks, the INLA continued to exist. The IPLO, which was heavily involved in drug dealing, was put out of existence by the Provisional IRA in a [[Night of the Long Knives (1992)|large scale operation in 1992]].\n\n===Recent history===\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, the IRSP has been involved in campaigns and political protests, mainly around [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]] but also in of parts of the [[Republic of Ireland]] as well.\n\nIn November 2016, after a number of raids on members of the party's homes, the IRSP issued a warning saying the PSNI were \"playing with fire\". IRSP's [[Lower Falls (District Electoral Area)|Lower Falls]] representative Michael Kelly claimed that \u201cBritish security forces risk bringing serious conflict onto the streets\u201d and said that \u201cThe Irish Republican Socialist Party has been in existence for over 40 years, in that time we have never tolerated attacks on our membership from any quarter,\u201d The comments drew criticism from [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] MLA [[Doug Beattie]] and [[SDLP]] [[Alex Attwood]].<ref>[http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2016/11/03/news/irsp-claims-police-playing-with-fire--767534/  IRSP warn police 'playing with fire' after series of house raids on members]</ref>\n\n==Elections==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!Election\n!First Preference Vote\n!Vote %\n!Seats\n|-\n| align=center|[[1981 Northern Ireland local elections|1981]]\n| align=center|3,654\n| align=center|0.5%\n| align=center|{{Composition bar|2|523|hex=#FF3300}}\n|-\n| align=center|[[2011 Northern Ireland local elections|2011]]\n| align=center|2,133\n| align=center|0.3%\n| align=center|{{Composition bar|0|572|hex=#FF3300}}\n|}\nIn [[1981 Northern Ireland local elections|1981]], party members Gerry Kelly and Sean Flynn won two seats on the [[Belfast City Council]] in a joint campaign with the [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]] party.

According to the IRSP, 80 people were in attendance.<ref name=PD/> A paramilitary wing, the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA), was founded the same day, although its existence was intended to be kept hidden until such a time that the INLA could operate effectively. Costello was elected as the party's first chairperson and the Army's first chief of staff. Together, the IRSP and the INLA referred to themselves as the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFormer [[Unity (Northern Ireland)|Unity]] MP for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette McAliskey]] served on the executive of the IRSP.<ref>[[Tim Pat Coogan|Coogan, Tim Pat]].

This led to the resignation of half the ''Ard Comhairle'', which weakened the party. [[Tony Gregory]], a future Dublin [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], was also a member for a short time.<ref>[http://www.irishleftreview.org/2009/01/06/tonygregory-1947-2009/ Tony Gregory: 1947 \u2013 2009]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Irish Left Review'', 6 January 2009.</ref> Its poor showing in the [[1977 Irish general election]], and the assassination of Seamus Costello, weakened the organisation.\n\nCostello had been expelled from the [[Official Irish Republican Army]] (OIRA) following a [[court-martial]], and from Official Sinn F\u00e9in on the same basis. Along with other activists, he was dissatisfied with the group's tactics and policies, especially on the issues surrounding the 1972 OIRA ceasefire and his growing belief that the emerging conflict was sectarian.\n\n===Clashes with other republicans and the British===\nIn 1977, Costello was shot dead in his car by a man armed with a shotgun. His supporters blamed the Official IRA for the killing.\n\nFollowing meetings between the INLA and OIRA leadership in Dublin, a truce was eventually reached, but in one of the first of the INLA's armed operations, [[Billy McMillen]], commanding officer of the OIRA Belfast Battalion, was murdered by [[Gerard Steenson]]. In the following years, the IRSP and INLA saw many of their members, including leading members [[Miriam Daly]], [[Ronnie Bunting]] and Noel Little, killed in attacks from British state forces and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries.\n\nThree members of the INLA died in the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]] in [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|HM Prison]] [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze]], also known as Long Kesh: [[Patsy O'Hara]], [[Kevin Lynch (hunger striker)|Kevin Lynch]], and [[Michael Devine (hunger striker)|Michael Devine]].\n\nIn 1987, the INLA and its political wing, the IRSP came under attack from the [[Irish People's Liberation Organisation]] (IPLO), an organisation founded by people who had resigned or been expelled from the INLA. The IPLO's initial aim was to destroy the IRSM and replace it with their organisation. Five members of the INLA and IRSP were killed by the IPLO, including leaders [[Ta Power]] and John O'Reilly. The INLA retaliated with several killings of their own. After the INLA killed the IPLO's leader, [[Gerard Steenson]], a truce was reached. Although severely damaged by the IPLO's attacks, the INLA continued to exist. The IPLO, which was heavily involved in drug dealing, was put out of existence by the Provisional IRA in a [[Night of the Long Knives (1992)|large scale operation in 1992]].\n\n===Recent history===\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, the IRSP has been involved in campaigns and political protests, mainly around [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]] but also in of parts of the [[Republic of Ireland]] as well.\n\nIn November 2016, after a number of raids on members of the party's homes, the IRSP issued a warning saying the PSNI were \"playing with fire\".

A [[Normans|Norman]], he was a member of the cathedral clergy at [[Rouen]] before becoming a [[Clerk#History and etymology|royal clerk]] under King [[William I of England]] and subsequently his son King [[William II of England|William II Rufus]]. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the [[Bishop of Hereford|Bishopric of Hereford]] in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, [[Henry I of England]], within days of William's death.\n\nSoon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant [[Diocese of York|see of York]], and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the [[Diocese of Canterbury|see of Canterbury]] concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure [[The Pope|papal]] recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in [[Scotland]], but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.\n\nGerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of [[astrology]], which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside [[York Minster]] after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the [[Architecture_of_the_medieval_cathedrals_of_England#Facades|cathedral porch]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nGerard was the nephew of [[Walkelin]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and [[Simeon (abbot)|Simon, Abbot of Ely]].<ref name=BHOYork>Greenway ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops''</ref> His parents were Osbert and Anna,<ref name=DNB>Burton \"Gerard\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk.<ref name=Rufus409>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 409</ref> The places and times of his birth and upbringing are unknown; he is documented as [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] of [[Rouen Cathedral]],<ref name=BHOHere/> and [[precentor]] of the same cathedral, although the dates of his appointments to either office are unrecorded.<ref name=BHOHere/> By 1091 he had become [[archdeacon]] of Rouen.<ref name=BHOHere>Barrow ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops''</ref> He served in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|royal chancery]] under successive kings of England, William I and William II.<ref name=BHOHere/>\n\n==Bishop of Hereford==\n[[File:Saint Urbain II pr\u00eachant la croisade.jpg|left|thumb|Gerard undertook missions to Pope Urban II, seen here preaching the [[First Crusade]] in an illustration from the ''Grand Chronicle of France,'' a work from about 1455.]]\n\nGerard was appointed Lord Chancellor of England in 1085,<ref name=Handbook83>Fryde, et al.

Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the [[antipope]] [[Antipope Clement III|Clement III]] in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody,{{efn|An anti-pope is a clergyman elected alongside an already elected pope, usually because of a contested election.

The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by [[Whitsun]] with a papal legate, [[Walter of Albano|Walter]] the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|Bishop of Albano]], who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.<ref name=Vaughn186>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 186\u2013189</ref>\n\nAlthough not yet [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|ordained]], Gerard was rewarded with the Bishopric of Hereford,<ref name=BHOHere/> and he was [[consecration|consecrated]] by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096;<ref name=Handbook250>Fryde, et al.

Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric.<ref name=HenryI135>Hollister ''Henry I'' pp. 135\u2013136</ref> Soon after his [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translation]] to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long [[Canterbury\u2013York dispute]]. At the 1102 [[Synods of Westminster|Council of Westminster]], Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's.<ref name=Church43>Barlow ''English Church 1066\u20131154'' p. 43</ref> He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope,<ref name=BHOYork/> to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding [[investiture]]s.<ref name=Vaughn239>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 239</ref> The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced.

Gerard gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese; the medieval chronicler [[Hugh the Chantor]] stated that Thomas II, Gerard's successor, accused Gerard of having dissipated the diocese's endowment.<ref name=DNB/> King [[Olaf I of the Isle of Man|Olaf I]] of Man and the Isles wrote to \"G\", Archbishop of York, asking for the consecration of \"our bishop\" by York, but it does not appear to have taken place under Gerard or his successor.<ref name=Watt110>Watt \"Bishops of the Isles\" ''Innes Review'' pp. 110\u2013111</ref>{{efn|Olaf had been in exile in England and is likely to have met Gerard there.<ref name=Watt110/>}}\n\nDuring the first four years of Henry's reign Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert of Meulan]], [[Counts of Meulan|Count of Meulan]] in Normandy and later [[Earl of Leicester]]. Gerard was one of Henry's greatest supporters among the bishops during the [[Investiture Controversy|Investiture Crisis]].<ref name=Cantor238>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 238\u2013249</ref> In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]], the [[Count of Flanders]], which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King [[Philip I of France]].<ref name=Green61>Green ''Henry I'' pp. 61\u201362</ref> After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham.<ref name=DNB/> In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused.<ref name=Cantor166>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 166\u2013167</ref> From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Antioch]], who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure.<ref name=Cantor238/> In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did.<ref name=Thurstan26>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 26</ref> At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.<ref name=Cantor238/>\n\nGerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office.<ref name=Vaughn334>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 334\u2013336</ref> Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nGerard also had an uneasy relationship with his [[cathedral chapter]],<ref name=Thurstan43/> after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests.<ref name=DNB/>{{efn|Priestly celibacy was not enforced with any rigour until the 12th century; most clergy of the 11th century would have been sons of priests.<ref name=Hamilton40>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 40</ref> Nor was it required that all cathedral clergy be ordained priests, they could have only taken vows for one of the lower [[Major orders|orders of the clergy]], such as the [[subdeacon]]ate or [[deaconate]].<ref name=Hamilton34>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 34</ref>}} He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular [[canon (priest)|canons]] who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting [[prebend]]s but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others.<ref name=Thurstan43>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' pp. 43\u201344</ref> It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between himself and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.<ref name=Thursatn114>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 114</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nGerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the ''[[Quadripartitus]]'' and the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', two 12th-century law books.

A [[Normans|Norman]], he was a member of the cathedral clergy at [[Rouen]] before becoming a [[Clerk#History and etymology|royal clerk]] under King [[William I of England]] and subsequently his son King [[William II of England|William II Rufus]]. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the [[Bishop of Hereford|Bishopric of Hereford]] in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, [[Henry I of England]], within days of William's death.\n\nSoon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant [[Diocese of York|see of York]], and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the [[Diocese of Canterbury|see of Canterbury]] concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure [[The Pope|papal]] recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in [[Scotland]], but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.\n\nGerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of [[astrology]], which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside [[York Minster]] after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the [[Architecture_of_the_medieval_cathedrals_of_England#Facades|cathedral porch]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nGerard was the nephew of [[Walkelin]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and [[Simeon (abbot)|Simon, Abbot of Ely]].<ref name=BHOYork>Greenway ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops''</ref> His parents were Osbert and Anna,<ref name=DNB>Burton \"Gerard\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk.<ref name=Rufus409>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 409</ref> The places and times of his birth and upbringing are unknown; he is documented as [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] of [[Rouen Cathedral]],<ref name=BHOHere/> and [[precentor]] of the same cathedral, although the dates of his appointments to either office are unrecorded.<ref name=BHOHere/> By 1091 he had become [[archdeacon]] of Rouen.<ref name=BHOHere>Barrow ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops''</ref> He served in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|royal chancery]] under successive kings of England, William I and William II.<ref name=BHOHere/>\n\n==Bishop of Hereford==\n[[File:Saint Urbain II pr\u00eachant la croisade.jpg|left|thumb|Gerard undertook missions to Pope Urban II, seen here preaching the [[First Crusade]] in an illustration from the ''Grand Chronicle of France,'' a work from about 1455.]]\n\nGerard was appointed Lord Chancellor of England in 1085,<ref name=Handbook83>Fryde, et al.

Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the [[antipope]] [[Antipope Clement III|Clement III]] in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody,{{efn|An anti-pope is a clergyman elected alongside an already elected pope, usually because of a contested election.

The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by [[Whitsun]] with a papal legate, [[Walter of Albano|Walter]] the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Albano|Bishop of Albano]], who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition.

As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Antioch]], who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure.<ref name=Cantor238/> In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did.<ref name=Thurstan26>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 26</ref> At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.<ref name=Cantor238/>\n\nGerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office.<ref name=Vaughn334>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 334\u2013336</ref> Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nGerard also had an uneasy relationship with his [[cathedral chapter]],<ref name=Thurstan43/> after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests.<ref name=DNB/>{{efn|Priestly celibacy was not enforced with any rigour until the 12th century; most clergy of the 11th century would have been sons of priests.<ref name=Hamilton40>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 40</ref> Nor was it required that all cathedral clergy be ordained priests, they could have only taken vows for one of the lower [[Major orders|orders of the clergy]], such as the [[subdeacon]]ate or [[deaconate]].<ref name=Hamilton34>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 34</ref>}} He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular [[canon (priest)|canons]] who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting [[prebend]]s but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others.<ref name=Thurstan43>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' pp. 43\u201344</ref> It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between himself and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.<ref name=Thursatn114>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 114</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nGerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the ''[[Quadripartitus]]'' and the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', two 12th-century law books.

Among the sins that Malmesbury imputed to him was the study of [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]], a late Roman astrologer, every morning, which to Malmesbury meant that Gerard was a sorcerer.<ref name=Church259>Barlow ''English Church 1066\u20131154'' p. 259</ref> Malmesbury further claimed that Gerard was \"lewd and lustful\".<ref name=DNB/> In Gerard's favour, Anselm regarded him as learned and highly intelligent.<ref name=Cantor238/> Some verses composed by Gerard survive in unpublished form, now in the [[British Library]] manuscript collection<ref name=Sharpe137>Sharpe ''Handlist of Latin Writers'' pp. 137\u2013138</ref> as part of manuscript [[Cotton Titus]] D.xxiv.<ref name=BLTitus>Staff \"Full Description: Cotton Titus D.xxiv\" ''Manuscripts Catalogue''</ref>{{efn|This collection was made about 1200 at [[Rufford Abbey]] in [[Nottinghamshire]].<ref name=Mozley1>Mozley \"Collection of Mediaeval Latin Verse\" ''Medium Aevum'' p. 1</ref> and includes five poems by Gerard, all on folio 61 of the manuscript.<ref name=Mozley8>Mozley \"Collection of Mediaeval Latin Verse\" ''Medium Aevum'' pp. 8\u20139</ref>}} A collection of his letters circulated in the mid-12th century, part of a bequest made to [[Bec Abbey]] in 1164 by [[Philip de Harcourt]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]], but it is now lost.<ref name=Sharpe137/>\n\nGerard died suddenly on 21 May 1108,<ref name=Handbook281/> at [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]],<ref name=BHOYork/> on his way to London to attend a council.

In the government reshuffle of 9 June 2009 Malik was given ministerial responsibility for issues of race, faith and community cohesion.

He wrote: \"Yes, foreign policy causes anger among many British Muslims but this does not in itself cause terrorism.

[[Aishah Azmi]], 24, was asked to remove her [[niqab]] veil after pupils found it hard to understand her during English language lessons. The school said she could wear the veil outside the classroom. Malik said: \"In schools the top priority has got to be the education of our children...

EDM 434 stated:\nThat this House values the cleaners who maintain high standards of service to Parliament; believes the parliamentary cleaners should be treated with respect and that it is wrong that, despite the widespread concern over their pay and conditions of employment, their pay has only increased from the national minimum wage of \u00a34.85 per hour to \u00a35 per hour; is concerned that the parliamentary cleaners only enjoy 12 days' paid holiday and have no company sick pay or pension; believes the time has come to end this sorry state of affairs; and urges the parliamentary authorities to reach agreement with the two contractors on making available the necessary resources to ensure that cleaners earn the London living wage.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-352354/Parliament-cleaners-threaten-strike-action.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Parliament cleaners threaten strike action | date=15 June 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Unbeaten parliamentary pool champion===\nMalik won the Parliamentary [[Blackball (pool)|pool]] championship for three years running in 2006, 2007 and 2008, becoming the only MP ever to retain the trophy.

This was followed by roles as Group Chief Executive of the Pakistan Muslim Centre (PMC), [[Sheffield]]; Head of Policy and Development at the Greater Nottingham Training and Enterprise Council; and then as Chief Executive of [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] Regeneration Agency, managing a \u00a3150&nbsp;million development programme.\n\nHe also served for three years as Chair of the Board of Directors of VONEF (voluntary organisations network for European funding in Yorkshire and the Humber); and served as National Chair of the [[voluntary sector]] body Urban Forum (1999\u20132002) elected annually by the 400 plus member organisations. The Forum was a respected national regeneration policy network made up of residents and community organisations, with the aim of pushing power to local people in deprived neighbourhoods.\n\nFollowing the [[Good Friday Peace Agreement]] of 1998 he was appointed by then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Rt Hon Mo Mowlam MP, as an Equality Commissioner for Northern Ireland (1999\u20132002). The [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland]] was born out of the 'Good Friday' peace agreement and was charged with dealing with equalities issues between Catholics & Protestants, Unionists & Nationalists, and discrimination by race, gender, disability, sexuality and age.

He said he had been trying to stop the violence and told the BBC he had been arrested by \"very hyped-up\" police. \"The riot shields were smashed in my face, causing four to five stitches above the eye, a black eye, lacerations to the arm, bruises on the back of the head, on the body and on the legs.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1407861.stm |title=Labour activist 'hurt by riot police' |publisher=BBC News |date=26 June 2001 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> On leaving Burnley General Hospital Malik said: \"No recriminations.

In the government reshuffle of 9 June 2009 Malik was given ministerial responsibility for issues of race, faith and community cohesion. In 2008 Malik was made an honorary Doctor of the [[University of Bradford]] for his contributions as Member of Parliament and, in particular, in recognition of the distinctive role he has played in working towards community cohesion and in striving for racial harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/news/awards/hon/shahid.php|title=Honorary Graduates&nbsp;\u2013 University of Bradford|accessdate=23 June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183545/http://www.brad.ac.uk/news/awards/hon/shahid.php|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He served as an Adviser to the government on Community Cohesion following race riots in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham in 2001.\n\n===Terrorism and extremism===\nJust two months after Malik was elected to the House of Commons it was revealed that the leader of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]], came from his Dewsbury constituency. Malik described the bombings as \"the most profound challenge yet faced by the British Muslim community\".

He wrote: \"Yes, foreign policy causes anger among many British Muslims but this does not in itself cause terrorism. Unquestionably, the lethal ingredient is a twisted, perverted interpretation of Islam whereby you can legitimately kill yourself and other innocent people, and you will go to Heaven.\" He concluded that: \"For British Muslims the fight against extremism is not just for the very soul of Islam but for the freedoms we enjoy as Britons.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article609121.ece|title=Why Muslims must rise up now and join the battle against extremism |date=15 August 2006|work=Shahid Malik|accessdate=20 June 2010 | location=London|first=Fiona|last=Hamilton}}</ref>\n\nMalik found controversy in February 2007 when he wrote, again in ''[[The Times]]'', that the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] should \"stop whingeing and show leadership.\" Referring to their decision not to play a part in [[Holocaust Memorial Day]], Malik wrote: \"Its flawed moral leadership places the MCB alongside the likes of the [[British National Party|BNP]] leader, [[Nick Griffin]], as nonattendees.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article1361537.ece|title=Stop whingeing and show leadership |date=10 February 2007|work=Shahid Malik|accessdate=20 June 2010 | location=London|first=Fiona|last=Hamilton}}</ref>\n\n===Voted one of the sexiest Members of Parliament===\nShahid Malik was regularly voted as one of the top five sexiest male MPs in the United Kingdom Parliament.

[[Aishah Azmi]], 24, was asked to remove her [[niqab]] veil after pupils found it hard to understand her during English language lessons. The school said she could wear the veil outside the classroom. Malik said: \"In schools the top priority has got to be the education of our children... I believe the education authority has bent over backwards to be accommodating and has been extremely reasonable and sensible in the decision it has come to.\"\"There is no religious obligation whatsoever for Muslim women to cover themselves up in front of primary school children.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6046992.stm|title=School suspends woman over veil |date=16 October 2006|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2009 Malik spoke out against comments made by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] after the French President declared the [[burqa]] was \"not welcome\" in France.
