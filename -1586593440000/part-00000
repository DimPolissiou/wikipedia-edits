At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]].

The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza Credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos.

It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]].

Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 {{lang|la|Missa}} as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]]. Most of these copies were written by Bach himself, but for the last movements of both Kyrie and Gloria his sons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] (soprano parts), [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] (violino I parts), and his wife [[Anna Magdalena Bach|Anna Magdalena]] (cello parts) helped, along with an anonymous copyist (oboe and basso continuo parts).<ref>[http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002721 D-Dl Mus.2405-D-21] at Dresden, S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2013 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (University library), available online at {{url|bach-digital.de}}</ref> Performance material for the choir was not included, nor was the basso continuo part very elaborated.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=53}} All these parts appear to have been copied directly from the full score, which Bach kept in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> Bach supplied the parts for single performers with many details that are not in the score he kept.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n[[File:Dresden Inneres der Hofkapelle 1719.jpg|thumb|500px|Interior of the Hofkirche (Hofkapelle){{efn|Court chapel: in this instance referring to the church building; other instances of Hofkapelle/court chapel in this article generally refer to [[chapel (music)|chapel as an ensemble of musicians]], directed by a [[chapel master]] (Kapellmeister).}} in 1719<ref>Hubert Ermisch.

Dresden: Baensch, 1888.</ref>]]\nAlthough some commentators suggest other liturgical and worldly venues where Bach may have anticipated a performance of the {{lang|la|Missa}},{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=41}} there seems little doubt that Bach intended to tailor the piece so that it could be performed at the Dresden Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\n=== Reception at the Dresden court ===\nWhen the composition arrived in Dresden its format wasn't very unusual compared to other works performed at the time at the Hofkirche. The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza Credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].
