When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said \"I'd just done the lute album \u2014 ''[[Songs from the Labyrinth]]''. I was thinking: 'Well what do I do? What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'\" Sting added that he saw the reunion as \"a kind of healing. I think solving problems is an exercise worth doing\".<ref name=heal>{{cite news |first = Chris | last = Iley | title = Sting: How I stopped hurting after The Police split | work = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 25 May 2007 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-457566/Sting-How-I-stopped-hurting-The-Police-split.html#ixzz3xGGlB7ow  | accessdate = 14 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The show==\nThe first show was a preview concert in Vancouver, for 4,000 members of the band's fan club, on 27 May 2007. The first official show was on 28 May 2007 in front of 22,000 fans at one of two nearly sold-out shows. Opening with \"Message in a Bottle\", the band performed for roughly two hours, playing mostly hits with a smattering of fan favourites.\n\nWhile the Vancouver concerts received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17358&sectionId=2 | title=''UnderGroundOnline'' review of Vancouver concert}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=9821a43f-a1c0-4be5-be6d-5cd16098c227&k=61567 | title=''Canada.com'' review of Vancouver concert | date=28 May 2007}}</ref> drummer Stewart Copeland, in a forum posting on his official site, called the band's 29 May performance \"lame\" and took humorous pokes at himself and his bandmates. He called one of Sting's song-ending leaps that of a \"petulant pansy instead of the god of rock\", joked the band botched the key changes so thoroughly they ended up playing \"avant-garde [[Twelve-tone scale|twelve-tone]] hodgepodges\" of \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" and \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\", suggested that guitarist Andy Summers was \"in Idaho\" when he and Sting ended up half a bar out of sync with each other during opener \"Message in a Bottle\", and claimed he \"made a hash\" out of a fill he had worked out for in \"Walking in Your Footsteps\" by playing it in the wrong part of the song. In spite of these glitches, however, he said he was enjoying himself and after the set he and his bandmates fell into each other's arms backstage, laughing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stewartcopeland.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=26795 | title=\"Our first disaster gig!\" ''stewartcopeland.net'' | date=31 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n\"It was a sincere criticism,\" Copeland explained. \"If you read the piece in context, it wasn't that vitriolic. It was an acknowledgement that we were only human. And we were struggling to make it work, playing as if our lives depended on it, and we still had to get it right\u2026 When Sting and Andy first read it, they were like, 'Oww!' But then they got over it.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mark|last=[[Mark Blake (writer)|Blake]]|title=The Great Return|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=258|date=January 2008|page=57}}</ref>\n\n==Stage design==\n[[File:Roxanne Police.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Police]] performing \"Roxanne\" on 28 May 2007 at GM Place, [[Vancouver]]]]\nThe stage setup for The Police was a simple split-level oval design, ringed with blue lights. Above the stage were seven LED screens\u2014three in the front of the stage, one on each side and two in the rear. The setup was not used during the show in The Woodlands on 20 May 2008 due to the smaller stage at the venue. In Marseille, France on 3 June 2008, the screens were used but not the split-level oval stage setup.\n\nThe placement of the band members echoed that of previous tours, with Sting and his bass equipment located stage-right, with Andy Summers and his guitar pedals and amps on stage-left. Stewart Copeland was located in the center rear. Behind him on a platform that could be raised and lowered, was a percussion setup consisting of various [[Kettle drum|timpanis]], hanging rotosounds, [[crotales|tuned percussion kits]], and digital xylophone centered by a 60\" [[gong]] used on various songs.<ref>[http://www.paiste.com/news/viewnews.php?newsid=402 \"Stewart Copeland's Amazing Police Reunion Tour Setup\"]</ref>\n\n==Musical changes==\nThe Police had spent months in North Vancouver and Tuscany, Italy rehearsing and putting a new spin on the songs. \"I think we've got a good mix now where the fans get the song they remember, and most of it will sound the way they remembered it. Just when they are enjoying that, they get a new twist. I think all three of us are pretty happy with the balance there\" Stewart Copeland from the 2007&ndash;2008 Tour Program describing the new takes on the songs. They updated them, and wrote out all of the backing parts so the three of them can play them; though some backup instrumentals and vocals (either pre-recorded or performed by off-stage musicians) were used.<ref>Background vocals not performed by Summers or Copeland were noticeable in several songs, for example, \"Roxanne\" and \"Every Breath You Take\"; An example of other background instrumental is a harmony guitar riff behind the one Summers played in \"Message in a Bottle\".</ref>\n\nTempos were slowed down for several songs, most notably \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\", which was slowed down to accent the powerful lyrics of the song. During \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\", \"Walking in Your Footsteps\" and \"[[King of Pain]]\", Stewart Copeland moved back and forth during the songs between his drumkit and the percussion setup on the elevated riser.\n\n\"The songs have to evolve. Twenty-odd years later we have to be better musicians than we were. So we've slowed it all down, looked at where we are, and how the songs are now happening by listening to ourselves play them\", said [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in the 2007&ndash;2008 tour programme.\n\nStewart Copeland was quoted as saying that he would \"like to add 'Hole in My Life'\" to the playlist at some point in the tour, and the song was performed live for the first time when the European tour kicked off in Stockholm on 29 August.\n\n==Set list==\nThis set list is representative of the performance in Mountain View on 14 July 2008.

When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said \"I'd just done the lute album \u2014 ''[[Songs from the Labyrinth]]''. I was thinking: 'Well what do I do? What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'\" Sting added that he saw the reunion as \"a kind of healing.

He called one of Sting's song-ending leaps that of a \"petulant pansy instead of the god of rock\", joked the band botched the key changes so thoroughly they ended up playing \"avant-garde [[Twelve-tone scale|twelve-tone]] hodgepodges\" of \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" and \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\", suggested that guitarist Andy Summers was \"in Idaho\" when he and Sting ended up half a bar out of sync with each other during opener \"Message in a Bottle\", and claimed he \"made a hash\" out of a fill he had worked out for in \"Walking in Your Footsteps\" by playing it in the wrong part of the song. In spite of these glitches, however, he said he was enjoying himself and after the set he and his bandmates fell into each other's arms backstage, laughing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stewartcopeland.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=26795 | title=\"Our first disaster gig!\" ''stewartcopeland.net'' | date=31 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n\"It was a sincere criticism,\" Copeland explained. \"If you read the piece in context, it wasn't that vitriolic. It was an acknowledgement that we were only human. And we were struggling to make it work, playing as if our lives depended on it, and we still had to get it right\u2026 When Sting and Andy first read it, they were like, 'Oww!' But then they got over it.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mark|last=[[Mark Blake (writer)|Blake]]|title=The Great Return|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=258|date=January 2008|page=57}}</ref>\n\n==Stage design==\n[[File:Roxanne Police.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Police]] performing \"Roxanne\" on 28 May 2007 at GM Place, [[Vancouver]]]]\nThe stage setup for The Police was a simple split-level oval design, ringed with blue lights. Above the stage were seven LED screens\u2014three in the front of the stage, one on each side and two in the rear. The setup was not used during the show in The Woodlands on 20 May 2008 due to the smaller stage at the venue. In Marseille, France on 3 June 2008, the screens were used but not the split-level oval stage setup.\n\nThe placement of the band members echoed that of previous tours, with Sting and his bass equipment located stage-right, with Andy Summers and his guitar pedals and amps on stage-left. Stewart Copeland was located in the center rear. Behind him on a platform that could be raised and lowered, was a percussion setup consisting of various [[Kettle drum|timpanis]], hanging rotosounds, [[crotales|tuned percussion kits]], and digital xylophone centered by a 60\" [[gong]] used on various songs.<ref>[http://www.paiste.com/news/viewnews.php?newsid=402 \"Stewart Copeland's Amazing Police Reunion Tour Setup\"]</ref>\n\n==Musical changes==\nThe Police had spent months in North Vancouver and Tuscany, Italy rehearsing and putting a new spin on the songs. \"I think we've got a good mix now where the fans get the song they remember, and most of it will sound the way they remembered it. Just when they are enjoying that, they get a new twist. I think all three of us are pretty happy with the balance there\" Stewart Copeland from the 2007&ndash;2008 Tour Program describing the new takes on the songs. They updated them, and wrote out all of the backing parts so the three of them can play them; though some backup instrumentals and vocals (either pre-recorded or performed by off-stage musicians) were used.<ref>Background vocals not performed by Summers or Copeland were noticeable in several songs, for example, \"Roxanne\" and \"Every Breath You Take\"; An example of other background instrumental is a harmony guitar riff behind the one Summers played in \"Message in a Bottle\".</ref>\n\nTempos were slowed down for several songs, most notably \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\", which was slowed down to accent the powerful lyrics of the song. During \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\", \"Walking in Your Footsteps\" and \"[[King of Pain]]\", Stewart Copeland moved back and forth during the songs between his drumkit and the percussion setup on the elevated riser.\n\n\"The songs have to evolve. Twenty-odd years later we have to be better musicians than we were. So we've slowed it all down, looked at where we are, and how the songs are now happening by listening to ourselves play them\", said [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in the 2007&ndash;2008 tour programme.\n\nStewart Copeland was quoted as saying that he would \"like to add 'Hole in My Life'\" to the playlist at some point in the tour, and the song was performed live for the first time when the European tour kicked off in Stockholm on 29 August.\n\n==Set list==\nThis set list is representative of the performance in Mountain View on 14 July 2008.

For many of these breeders, the inherent concerns with health and temperament for dogs who are being produced through repeated and more closely inbreeding and line-breeding led them to the Labradoodle or Australian Labradoodle.

It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in ''16:9''. For an ''x'':''y'' aspect ratio, the image is ''x'' units wide and ''y'' units high. Widely used aspect ratios include 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 in [[film]] photography, 4:3 and [[16:9]] in [[television]], and 3:2 in [[still camera]] photography.\n\n== Some common examples ==\n\nThe most common aspect ratios used today in the presentation of [[film]]s in cinemas are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1.<ref name=\"anamorphic\">The 2.39:1 ratio is commonly labeled 2.40:1, e.g., in the [[American Society of Cinematographers]]' ''American Cinematographer Manual'' (Many widescreen films before the 1970 [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] revision used 2.35:1).</ref> Two common [[videography|videographic]] aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1),{{Efn|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}} the universal video format of the 20th century, and [[16:9]] (1.{{overline|7}}:1), universal for [[high-definition television]] and European [[digital television]].

The universal standard (established by [[William Kennedy Dickson|William Dickson]] and [[Thomas Edison]] in 1892) is a frame that is four perforations high. The film itself is 35&nbsp;mm wide (1.38&nbsp;in), but the area between the perforations is 24.89&nbsp;mm \u00d7 18.67&nbsp;mm (0.980&nbsp;in \u00d7 0.735&nbsp;in), leaving the de facto ratio of 4:3, or 1.{{overline|3}}:1.<ref name=\"asc\">{{Cite book | last = Burum | first = Stephen | year = 2004 | title = American Cinematographer Manual | edition = 9th | publisher = ASC Press | isbn = 0-935578-24-2 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nWith a space designated for the standard [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]], and the frame size reduced to maintain an image that is wider than tall, this resulted in the [[Academy ratio|Academy]] aperture of 22&nbsp;mm \u00d7 16&nbsp;mm (0.866&nbsp;in \u00d7 0.630&nbsp;in) or 1.375:1 aspect ratio.\n\n== Cinema terminology ==\nThe [[motion picture industry]] convention assigns a value of 1.0 to the image's height; an [[anamorphic]] frame (since 1970, 2.39:1) is often incorrectly described (rounded) as 2.40:1 or 2.40 (\"two-four-oh\"). After 1952, a number of aspect ratios were experimented with for anamorphic productions, including 2.66:1 and 2.55:1.<ref name=\"arri\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/?eID=registration&file_uid=7737 |title=ALEXA Anamorphic De-squeeze |publisher=Arri |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> A [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] specification for anamorphic projection from 1957 (PH22.106-1957) finally standardized the aperture to 2.35:1.<ref name=\"arri\"/> An update in 1970 (PH22.106-1971) changed the aspect ratio to 2.39:1 in order to make splices less noticeable.<ref name=\"arri\"/> This aspect ratio of 2.39:1 was confirmed by the most recent revision from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993).<ref name=\"arri\"/>\n\nIn American cinemas, the common projection ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. Some European countries have 1.{{overline|6}}:1 as the wide screen standard. The \"Academy ratio\" of 1.375:1 was used for all cinema films in the sound era until 1953 (with the release of [[George Stevens|George Stevens']] ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' in 1.{{overline|6}}:1). During that time, television, which had a similar aspect ratio of 1.{{overline|3}}:1, became a perceived threat to movie studios. Hollywood responded by creating a large number of wide-screen formats: [[CinemaScope]] (up to 2.{{overline|6}}:1), [[Todd-AO]] (2.20:1), and [[VistaVision]] (initially 1.50:1, now 1.{{overline|6}}:1 to 2.00:1) to name just a few. The \"flat\" 1.85:1 aspect ratio was introduced in May 1953, and became one of the most common cinema projection standards in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThe goal of these various lenses and aspect ratios was to capture as much of the frame as possible, onto as large an area of the film as possible, in order to fully utilize the film being used. Some of the aspect ratios were chosen to utilize smaller film sizes in order to save film costs while other aspect ratios were chosen to use larger film sizes in order to produce a wider higher resolution image. In either case the image was squeezed horizontally to fit the film's frame size and avoid any unused film area.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.filmanddigitaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Anamorphic-Math-FDTimes.pdf |title=Anamorphic Now |accessdate=2014-06-21 |pages=24\u201331 |issue=53 |magazine=Film and Digital Times |date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Movie camera systems ===\nDevelopment of various film camera systems must ultimately cater to the placement of the frame in relation to the lateral constraints of the perforations and the optical soundtrack area. One clever wide screen alternative, [[VistaVision]], used standard 35&nbsp;mm film running sideways through the camera gate, so that the sprocket holes were above and below frame, allowing a larger horizontal negative size per frame as only the vertical size was now restricted by the perforations. There were even a limited number of projectors constructed to also run the print-film horizontally. Generally, however, the 1.50:1 ratio of the initial VistaVision image was optically converted to a vertical print (on standard four-perforation [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]]) to show with the standard projectors available at theaters, and was then masked in the projector to the US standard of 1.85:1. The format was briefly revived by [[Lucasfilm]] in the late 1970s for special effects work that required larger negative size (due to image degradation from the optical printing steps necessary to make multi-layer composites). It went into obsolescence largely due to better cameras, lenses, and film stocks available to standard four-perforation formats, in addition to increased lab costs of making prints in comparison to more standard vertical processes. (The horizontal process was also adapted to 70&nbsp;mm film by [[IMAX]], which was first shown at the Osaka '70 Worlds Fair.)\n\n[[16&nbsp;mm film|Super 16&nbsp;mm film]] was frequently used for television production due to its lower cost, lack of need for soundtrack space on the film itself (as it is not projected but rather transferred to video), and aspect ratio similar to 16:9 (the native ratio of Super 16&nbsp;mm is 15:9). It also can be blown up to 35&nbsp;mm for theatrical release and therefore is sometimes used for feature films.\n\n== Current video standards ==\n\n=== 1:1 (Square) ===\nSquare displays are rarely used in devices<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_passport-6457.php|title=BlackBerry Passport \u2013 Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_smartwatch_3_swr50-7691.php|title=Sony SmartWatch 3 SWR50 \u2013 Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> and monitors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/news/eizos-27-inch-3k-display-is-perfectly-square-1610009/|title=Eizo's 27-inch 3K display is perfectly square - Geek.com|date=2014-11-20|work=Geek.com|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Nonetheless, video consumption on social apps has grown rapidly and led to the emergence of new video formats more suited to mobile devices that can be held in horizontal and vertical orientations. In that sense, square video was popularized by mobile apps such as [[Instagram]] and has since been supported by other major social platforms including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. It can fill nearly twice as much screen space compared to 16:9 format (when the device is held differently while viewing from how video was recorded).\n\n=== 4:3 standard ===\n{{main|Fullscreen (filmmaking)}}\n4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1) (generally read as Four-Three, Four-by-Three, or Four-to-Three) for standard television has been in use since the invention of [[movie camera|moving picture camera]]s and many [[computer monitor]]s used to employ the same aspect ratio. 4:3 was the aspect ratio used for [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm films]] in the [[silent film|silent era]]. It is also very close to the 1.375:1 [[Academy ratio]], defined by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as a standard after the advent of optical [[sound-on-film]]. By having TV match this aspect ratio, movies originally photographed on 35&nbsp;mm film could be satisfactorily viewed on TV in the early days of the medium (i.e. the 1940s and the 1950s). \n\nWith the adoption of [[High-definition television|high definition television]], the majority of modern televisions are now produced with 16:9 displays instead. Apple's [[iPad]] series of [[tablet computer|tablets]], however, continue to use 4:3 displays (despite other Apple products typically using widescreen aspect ratios) to better suit use as an [[e-reader]]. But the 2018 iPad Pro 11 inch uses a 1.43:1 Aspect ratio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1146035/ipad-screen.html|title=Why Apple chose the iPad's screen format|last=McElhearn|first=Kirk|date=2010-02-01|website=Macworld|language=en|access-date=2019-07-24|}}</ref>\n\n=== 16:9 standard ===\n{{Main|16:9 aspect ratio}}\n[[16:9 aspect ratio|16:9]] (1.{{overline|7}}:1) (generally named as Sixteen-by-Nine, Sixteen-Nine, and Sixteen-to-Nine) is the international standard format of [[High-definition television|HDTV]], non-HD digital [[television]] and analog widescreen television [[PALplus]]. Japan's [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|Hi-Vision]] originally started with a 5:3 (= 15:9) ratio but converted when the international standards group introduced a wider ratio of 5\u2153 to 3 (= 16:9). Many [[digital video]] cameras have the capability to record in 16:9 (= 4<sup>2</sup>:3<sup>2</sup>), and 16:9 is the only widescreen aspect ratio natively supported by the [[DVD-Video#Frame size and frame rate|DVD]] standard. DVD producers can also choose to show even wider ratios such as 1.85:1 and 2.39:1<ref name=\"anamorphic\" /> within the 16:9 DVD frame by [[hard matting]] or adding black bars within the image itself. However, it was used often in British TVs in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1990s.

When projected, image have an approximated 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 (often rounded to 2.4:1) aspect ratio. \"21:9 aspect ratio\" is actually 64:27 (= 4<sup>3</sup>:3<sup>3</sup>), or approximately 2.37:1, and is a near both cinematic movie aspect ratios.\n\nMobile devices are now starting to use the 21:9 format, such as the [[Sony Xperia 1]].\n\n=== Vertical video ===\nAnother trend arising from the massive use of smartphones is [[Vertical video]] (9:16), that is intended for viewing in [[Page orientation|portrait mode]]. It was popularized by [[Snapchat]] and is also now being adopted by Twitter and Facebook. Instagram stories are based on this aspect ratio as well.\n\n== Obtaining height, width, and area of the screen ==\nOften, screen specifications are given by their diagonal length. The following formulae can be used to find the height (''h''), width (''w'') and area (''A''), where ''r'' stands for ratio, written as a fraction, and ''d'' for diagonal length.\n\n:<math>h=\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{r^2+1}} \\qquad w=\\frac{r\\times d}{\\sqrt{{r^2}+1}}  \\qquad A=\\frac{r\\times d^2}{{r^2}+1}=\\frac{d^2}{r+\\frac{1}{r}}</math>\n\n== Distinctions ==\n{{Further|Pixel aspect ratio}}\nThis article primarily addresses the aspect ratio of images ''as displayed,'' which is more formally referred to as the ''display aspect ratio'' (DAR). In [[digital image]]s, there is a distinction with the ''{{visible anchor|storage aspect ratio}}'' (SAR), which is the ratio of [[pixel dimensions]]. If an image is displayed with [[square pixel]]s, then these ratios agree; if not, then non-square, \"rectangular\" pixels are used, and these ratios disagree. The aspect ratio of the pixels themselves is known as the [[pixel aspect ratio]] (PAR) \u2013 for square pixels this is 1:1 \u2013 and these are related by the identity:\n:SAR&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;PAR&nbsp;=&nbsp;DAR.\nRearranging (solving for PAR) yields:\n:PAR&nbsp;=&nbsp;DAR/SAR.\nFor example, a 640&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;480 [[VGA]] image has a SAR of 640/480 = 4:3, and if displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), has square pixels, hence a PAR of 1:1. By contrast, a 720&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;576 [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]] PAL image has a SAR of 720/576 = 5:4, but is displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), so by this formula it would have a PAR of (4:3)/(5:4) = 16:15.\n\nHowever, because standard definition digital video was originally based on digitally sampling analog television, the 720 horizontal pixels actually capture a slightly wider image to avoid loss of the original analog picture. In actual images, these extra pixels are often partly or entirely black, as only the center 704 horizontal pixels carry actual 4:3 or 16:9 image. Hence, the actual pixel aspect ratio for PAL video is a little different from that given by the formula, specifically 12:11 for PAL and 10:11 for NTSC. For consistency, the same effective pixel aspect ratios are used even for standard definition digital video originated in digital form rather than converted from analog. For more details refer to the [[Pixel aspect ratio#Analog-to-digital conversion|main article]].\n\nIn analog images such as film there is no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, and \"aspect ratio\" refers unambiguously to DAR. Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though digital sensors might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.\n\nNon-square pixels arise often in early digital TV standards, related to digitalization of analog TV signals \u2013 whose horizontal and vertical resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels \u2013 and also in some digital videocameras and computer [[display mode]]s, such as [[Color Graphics Adapter]] (CGA). Today they arise particularly in [[transcoding]] between resolutions with different SARs.\n\nDAR is also known as ''image aspect ratio'' and ''picture aspect ratio'', though the latter can be confused with ''pixel'' aspect ratio.\n\n== Visual comparisons ==\nComparing two different aspect ratios poses some subtleties \u2013 when comparing two aspect ratios, one may compare images with equal height, equal width, equal diagonal, or equal area. More amorphous questions include whether particular subject matter has a natural aspect ratio (panoramas being wide, full-length images of people being tall), or whether a particular ratio is more or less aesthetically pleasing, for example the [[golden ratio]] (~1.618).\n\nTelevisions and other displays typically list their size by their diagonal. Given the same diagonal, a 4:3 screen has more area compared to 16:9. For CRT-based technology, an aspect ratio that is closer to square is cheaper to manufacture. The same is true for projectors, and other optical devices such as cameras, camcorders, etc. For LCD and plasma displays, however, the cost is more related to the area. Producing wider and shorter screens can yield the same advertised diagonal, but with less area.\n\nThe following compares crops of an image at 4:3 and 16:9 ratios, with different dimensions set equal. Note that either image (or both) can be cropped; one aspect doesn't necessarily show more detail than the other.\n\n* Images using the same diagonal size:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example3.jpg|thumbnail|center|310px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n* Images using the same area / same number of pixels:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example4.jpg|thumbnail|center|283px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example4.jpg|thumbnail|center|327px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n* Images using the same height / same vertical size:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|380px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n* Images using the same width/ same horizontal size:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example2.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n\n== Previous and currently used aspect ratios ==\n:''See [[list of common resolutions]] for a listing of computer resolutions and aspect ratios.''\n:''See [[list of film formats]] for a full listing of film formats, including their aspect ratios.''\n[[File:Filmaspectratios.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of several film aspect ratios with the heights forced to be equal.]]\n\n* '''1.19:1 (19:16)''': Sometimes referred to as the [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] ratio, this ratio was used briefly during the transitional period when the film industry was converting to sound, from 1926 to 1932 approx. It is produced by superimposing an optical soundtrack over a full-gate 1.{{overline|3}} aperture in printing, resulting in an almost square image.

Used in subsequent Disney theme parks and other past applications.\n\n== Aspect ratio releases ==\n\n=== Original aspect ratio (OAR) ===\n\n''Original Aspect Ratio'' (OAR) is a [[home cinema]] term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a [[film]] or visual production was produced \u2013 as envisioned by the people involved in the creation of the work. As an example, the film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' was released to theaters in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. It was filmed in [[Super 35]] and, in addition to being presented in cinemas and television in the Original Aspect Ratio of 2.39:1, it was also broadcast without the [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]], altering the aspect ratio to the television standard of 1.{{overline|3}}:1. Because of the varied ways in which films are shot, IAR (Intended Aspect Ratio) is a more appropriate term, but is rarely used.\n\n=== Modified aspect ratio (MAR) ===\n\n''Modified Aspect Ratio'' is a home cinema term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a film was modified to fit a specific type of screen, as opposed to original aspect ratio. Modified aspect ratios are usually either 1.{{overline|3}}:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.{{overline|7}}:1 aspect ratio. 1.{{overline|3}}:1 is the modified aspect ratio used historically in VHS format. A modified aspect ratio transfer is achieved by means of [[pan and scan]] or [[open matte]], the latter meaning removing the cinematic matte from a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.{{overline|3}}:1 frame. Another name for it is \"prescaled\" aspect ratio\".\n\n== Problems in film and television ==\n[[File:Windowboxed.jpg|thumb|right|375px|A [[windowbox (film)|windowboxed]] image]]\n\nMultiple aspect ratios create additional burdens on directors and the public, and confusion among TV broadcasters. It is common for a widescreen film to be presented in an altered format ([[cropping (image)|cropped]], [[letterbox]]ed or expanded beyond the original aspect ratio). It is also not uncommon for [[windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] to occur (when letterbox and pillarbox happen simultaneously). For instance, a 16:9 broadcast could embed a 4:3 commercial within the 16:9 image area. A viewer watching on a standard 4:3 (non-widescreen) television would see a 4:3 image of the commercial with 2 sets of black stripes, vertical and horizontal ([[windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] or the [[Matchboxing#Pillarboxing and gutterboxing|postage stamp]] effect). A similar scenario may also occur for a widescreen set owner when viewing 16:9 material embedded in a 4:3 frame, and then watching that in 16:9. [[Active Format Description]] is a mechanism used in digital broadcasting to avoid this problem. It is also common that a 4:3 image is stretched horizontally to fit a 16:9 screen to avoid [[letterbox|pillar boxing]] but distorts the image so subjects appear short and fat.\n\nBoth PAL and NTSC have provision for some data pulses contained within the video signal used to signal the aspect ratio (See ITU-R BT.1119-1 \u2013 [[Widescreen signaling]] for broadcasting). These pulses are detected by television sets that have widescreen displays and cause the television to automatically switch to 16:9 display mode. When 4:3 material is included (such as the aforementioned commercial), the television switches to a 4:3 display mode to correctly display the material. Where a video signal is transmitted via a European [[SCART]] connection, one of the status lines is used to signal 16:9 material as well.\n\n== Still photography ==\nCommon aspect ratios in [[photography|still photography]] include:\n\n* 1:1\n* 5:4 (1.25:1)\n* 4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)\n* 3:2 (1.5:1)\n* 5:3 (1.{{overline|6}}:1)\n* 16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)\n* 3:1\n\nMany digital still cameras offer user options for selecting multiple image aspect ratios. Some achieve this through the use of multi-aspect sensors (notably [[Panasonic]]), while others simply crop their native image format to have the output match the desired image aspect ratio.\n\n=== 1:1 ===\n\nIs the classic Kodak image, and is available as a choice in some digital still cameras, and hearkens back to the days of film cameras when the square image was popular with photographers using twin lens reflex cameras. These medium format cameras used [[120 film]] rolled onto spools. The 6 \u00d7 6&nbsp;cm image size was the classic 1:1 format in the recent past. 120 film can still be found and used today. Many [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[instant film]]s were designed as square formats. Furthermore, up until August 2015, photo-sharing site [[Instagram]] only allowed users to upload images in 1:1 format. In 2017, Fujifilm added the 1:1 [[Instax#Instax Square|Instax Square]] format to their lineup of instant film cameras.\n\n=== 5:4 ===\n\nCommon in large and medium format photography, and still in common use for prints from digital cameras in the 8\"\u00d710\" size.\n\n=== 4:3 ===\nIs used by most digital [[point-and-shoot camera]]s, [[Four Thirds system]], [[Micro Four Thirds system]] cameras and [[medium format]] 645 cameras. The 4:3 digital format popularity was developed to match the then prevailing digital displays of the time, 4:3 computer monitors.\n\nThe next several formats have their roots in classic film photography image sizes, both the classic 35&nbsp;mm film camera, and the multiple format [[Advanced Photo System]] ([[Advanced Photo System|APS]]) film camera. The APS camera was capable of selecting any of three image formats, APS-H (\"High Definition\" mode), APS-C (\"Classic\" mode) and APS-P (\"Panoramic\" mode).\n\n=== 3:2 ===\nis used by classic [[135 film|35&nbsp;mm film]] cameras using a 24&nbsp;mm \u00d7 36&nbsp;mm image size, and their digital derivatives represented by [[DSLR]]s. Typical DSLRs come in two flavors, the so-called professional \"full frame\" (24&nbsp;mm \u00d7 36&nbsp;mm) sensors and variations of smaller, so called \"APS-C\" sensors. The term \"APS\" is derived from another film format known as\nthe [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] and the \"-C\" refers to \"Classic\" mode, which exposed images over a smaller area (25.1&nbsp;mm \u00d7 16.7&nbsp;mm) but retaining the same \"classic\" 3:2 proportions as full frame 35&nbsp;mm film cameras.\n\nWhen discussing DSLR's and their non-SLR derivatives, the term APS-C has become an almost generic term. The two major camera manufacturers [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Nikon]] each developed and established sensor standards for their own versions of APS-C sized and proportioned sensors. Canon actually developed two standards, APS-C and a slightly larger area APS-H (not to be confused with the APS-H film format), while Nikon developed its own APS-C standard, which it calls [[Nikon DX format|DX]]. Regardless of the different flavors of sensors, and their varying sizes, they are close enough to the original APS-C image size, and maintain the classic 3:2 image proportions that these sensors are generally known as an \"APS-C\" sized sensor.\n\nThe reason for DSLR's image sensors being the flatter 3:2 versus the taller point-and-shoot 4:3 is that DSLRs were designed to match the legacy 35&nbsp;mm SLR film, whereas the majority of digital cameras were designed to match the predominant computer displays of the time, with VGA, SVGA, XGA and UXGA all being 4:3. Widescreen computer monitors did not become popular until the advent of [[HDTV]], which uses a 16:9 image aspect ratio.\n\n=== 16:9 ===\n16:9 is another format that has its roots in the APS film camera.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Known as APS-H (30.2&nbsp;mm \u00d7 16.7&nbsp;mm), with the \"-H\" denoting \"High Definition\", the 16:9 format is also the standard image aspect ratio for HDTV. 16:9 is gaining popularity as a format in all classes of consumer still cameras which also shoot High Definition ([[high-definition video|HD]]) [[video]]. When still cameras have an HD video capability, some can also record stills in the 16:9 format, ideal for display on HD televisions and widescreen computer displays.\n\n=== 3:1 ===\nis another format that can find its roots in the APS film camera. Known as APS-P (30.2 \u00d7 9.5&nbsp;mm), with the -P\" denoting \"Panorama\", the 3:1 format was used for [[panorama]] photography. The APS-P panorama standard is the least adhered to any APS standard, and panoramic implementation varies with by manufacturer on different cameras, with the only commonality being that the image is much longer than it is tall, in the classic \"panorama\" style.\n\nCommon [[Photo print sizes|print sizes]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] (in [[inch]]es) include 4\u00d76 (1.5), 5\u00d77 (1.4), 4\u00d75 and 8\u00d710 (1.25), and 11\u00d714 (1.27); [[large format]] cameras typically use one of these aspect ratios. [[Medium format (film)|Medium-format]] cameras typically have format designated by nominal sizes in centimeters (6\u00d76, 6\u00d77, 6\u00d79, 6\u00d74.5), but these numbers should not be interpreted as exact in computing aspect ratios. For example, the usable height of [[120 film|120-format roll film]] is 56mm, so a width of 70mm (as in 6\u00d77) yields an aspect ratio of 4:5 \u2014 ideal for enlarging to make an 8\u00d710\" portrait. Print sizes are usually defined by their portrait dimensions (tall) while equipment aspect ratios are defined by their landscape dimensions (wide, flipped sideways). A good example of this a 4\u00d76 print (6&nbsp;inch wide by 4&nbsp;inch tall landscape) perfectly matches the 3:2 aspect ratio of a DSLR/35&nbsp;mm, since 6/2=3 and 4/2=2.\n\nFor analog projection of photographic slides, projector and screen use a 1:1 aspect ratio, supporting horizontal and vertical orientation equally well. In contrast, digital projection technology typically supports vertically oriented images only at a fraction of the resolution of landscape-oriented images. For example, projecting a digital still image having a 3:2 aspect ratio on a 16:9 projector employs 84.3% of available resolution in horizontal orientation, but only 37.5% in vertical orientation.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Active Format Description]] (AFD)\n* [[Index of motion picture terminology]]\n* [[Paper size]]\n* [[Shoot and protect]]\n* [[Glossary of video terms]]\n* [[Ultrawide formats]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{commons category|Aspect ratio}}\n\n=== On Aspect Ratios ===\n\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm |title=NEC Monitor Technology Guide |accessdate=2006-07-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060521000427/http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm  |archivedate = 2006-05-21}}\n*[http://www.widescreen.org/ The Letterbox and Widescreen Advocacy Page]\n*[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/index.htm American Widescreen Museum]\n*[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/apertures.htm Widescreen Apertures and Aspect Ratios]\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207004356/http://aspect.fre3.com |date=December 7, 2013 |title=Aspect \u2013 combined aspect ratio, frame size and bitrate calculator }}\n* Aspect Ratios Explained: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090624175845/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/DVDs/AspectRatios/ Part 1] [http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/aspect-ratios-explained-part-two.html Part 2]\n*[http://bitbucket.co.uk/work/aspect_ratios.html Explanation of TV Aspect Ratio format description codes]\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624175845/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/DVDs/AspectRatios/ |date=June 24, 2009 |title=IMDb \u2013 Number of DVDs for each aspect ratio }}\n*[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993D0424:EN:HTML SCADplus: 16:9 Action plan for the television in the 16:9 screen format \u2013 European Union]\n\n=== Calculators ===\n*[https://aspect-ratio-calculator.com/ Calculate aspect ratio online]\n*{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-4.html#calculator |title=Calculator to Determine Size of 4:3 Image on 16:9 Screen |accessdate=2006-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801020257/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-4.html#calculator |archivedate=2010-08-01 }} (middle of the page)\n*[https://calculateaspectratio.com/ Aspect Ratio Calculator]\n*[https://www.ninjaunits.com/converters/pixels/ Pixel conversions]\n*[http://nxu.biz/tools/ARCalculator/ ARCalculator \u2013 A nice aspect ratio, image ratio, size converter and calculator]\n\n{{Fractions and ratios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aspect Ratio (Image)}}\n[[Category:Ratios]]\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n\n[[sq:16:9]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Width/height proportion of an image}}\n{{About|aspect ratio of still images, films, and digital imagery|another article on this subject|display aspect ratio}}\n{{Common image aspect ratios}}\n\nThe '''aspect ratio''' of an image is the ratio of its width to its height. It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in ''16:9''. For an ''x'':''y'' aspect ratio, the image is ''x'' units wide and ''y'' units high. Widely used aspect ratios include 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 in [[film]] photography, 4:3 and [[16:9]] in [[television]], and 3:2 in [[still camera]] photography.\n\n== Some common examples ==\n\nThe most common aspect ratios used today in the presentation of [[film]]s in cinemas are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1.<ref name=\"anamorphic\">The 2.39:1 ratio is commonly labeled 2.40:1, e.g., in the [[American Society of Cinematographers]]' ''American Cinematographer Manual'' (Many widescreen films before the 1970 [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] revision used 2.35:1).</ref> Two common [[videography|videographic]] aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1),{{Efn|[[Repeating decimal#Notation|Repeating decimal notation]]}} the universal video format of the 20th century, and [[16:9]] (1.{{overline|7}}:1), universal for [[high-definition television]] and European [[digital television]]. Other cinema and video aspect ratios exist, but are used infrequently.\n\nIn [[still camera]] photography, the most common aspect ratios are 4:3, 3:2, and more recently found in consumer cameras, 16:9.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.techtree.com/India/News/Panasonic_Introduces_2_New_Cameras/551-97953-893.html |title=Panasonic Introduces 2 New Cameras |publisher=Tech Tree |location=India |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123073441/http://techtree.com/India/News/Panasonic_Introduces_2_New_Cameras/551-97953-893.html |archivedate=2009-01-23 }}</ref> Other aspect ratios, such as 5:3, 5:4, and 1:1 (square format), are used in photography as well, particularly in [[medium format]] and [[large format]].\n\nWith television, [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]], converting formats of unequal ratios is achieved by enlarging the original image to fill the receiving format's display area and cutting off any excess picture information ([[digital zoom|zooming]] and [[cropping]]), by adding horizontal mattes ([[letterbox]]ing) or vertical mattes ([[pillarbox]]ing) to retain the original format's aspect ratio, by stretching (hence distorting) the image to fill the receiving format's ratio, or by scaling by different factors in both directions, possibly scaling by a different factor in the center and at the edges (as in ''Wide Zoom mode'').\n\n== Practical limitations ==\nIn motion picture formats, the physical size of the film area between the [[sprocket]] perforations determines the image's size. The universal standard (established by [[William Kennedy Dickson|William Dickson]] and [[Thomas Edison]] in 1892) is a frame that is four perforations high. The film itself is 35&nbsp;mm wide (1.38&nbsp;in), but the area between the perforations is 24.89&nbsp;mm \u00d7 18.67&nbsp;mm (0.980&nbsp;in \u00d7 0.735&nbsp;in), leaving the de facto ratio of 4:3, or 1.{{overline|3}}:1.<ref name=\"asc\">{{Cite book | last = Burum | first = Stephen | year = 2004 | title = American Cinematographer Manual | edition = 9th | publisher = ASC Press | isbn = 0-935578-24-2 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nWith a space designated for the standard [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]], and the frame size reduced to maintain an image that is wider than tall, this resulted in the [[Academy ratio|Academy]] aperture of 22&nbsp;mm \u00d7 16&nbsp;mm (0.866&nbsp;in \u00d7 0.630&nbsp;in) or 1.375:1 aspect ratio.\n\n== Cinema terminology ==\nThe [[motion picture industry]] convention assigns a value of 1.0 to the image's height; an [[anamorphic]] frame (since 1970, 2.39:1) is often incorrectly described (rounded) as 2.40:1 or 2.40 (\"two-four-oh\"). After 1952, a number of aspect ratios were experimented with for anamorphic productions, including 2.66:1 and 2.55:1.<ref name=\"arri\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/?eID=registration&file_uid=7737 |title=ALEXA Anamorphic De-squeeze |publisher=Arri |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> A [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] specification for anamorphic projection from 1957 (PH22.106-1957) finally standardized the aperture to 2.35:1.<ref name=\"arri\"/> An update in 1970 (PH22.106-1971) changed the aspect ratio to 2.39:1 in order to make splices less noticeable.<ref name=\"arri\"/> This aspect ratio of 2.39:1 was confirmed by the most recent revision from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993).<ref name=\"arri\"/>\n\nIn American cinemas, the common projection ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. Some European countries have 1.{{overline|6}}:1 as the wide screen standard. The \"Academy ratio\" of 1.375:1 was used for all cinema films in the sound era until 1953 (with the release of [[George Stevens|George Stevens']] ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' in 1.{{overline|6}}:1). During that time, television, which had a similar aspect ratio of 1.{{overline|3}}:1, became a perceived threat to movie studios. Hollywood responded by creating a large number of wide-screen formats: [[CinemaScope]] (up to 2.{{overline|6}}:1), [[Todd-AO]] (2.20:1), and [[VistaVision]] (initially 1.50:1, now 1.{{overline|6}}:1 to 2.00:1) to name just a few. The \"flat\" 1.85:1 aspect ratio was introduced in May 1953, and became one of the most common cinema projection standards in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThe goal of these various lenses and aspect ratios was to capture as much of the frame as possible, onto as large an area of the film as possible, in order to fully utilize the film being used. Some of the aspect ratios were chosen to utilize smaller film sizes in order to save film costs while other aspect ratios were chosen to use larger film sizes in order to produce a wider higher resolution image. In either case the image was squeezed horizontally to fit the film's frame size and avoid any unused film area.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.filmanddigitaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Anamorphic-Math-FDTimes.pdf |title=Anamorphic Now |accessdate=2014-06-21 |pages=24\u201331 |issue=53 |magazine=Film and Digital Times |date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Movie camera systems ===\nDevelopment of various film camera systems must ultimately cater to the placement of the frame in relation to the lateral constraints of the perforations and the optical soundtrack area. One clever wide screen alternative, [[VistaVision]], used standard 35&nbsp;mm film running sideways through the camera gate, so that the sprocket holes were above and below frame, allowing a larger horizontal negative size per frame as only the vertical size was now restricted by the perforations. There were even a limited number of projectors constructed to also run the print-film horizontally. Generally, however, the 1.50:1 ratio of the initial VistaVision image was optically converted to a vertical print (on standard four-perforation [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]]) to show with the standard projectors available at theaters, and was then masked in the projector to the US standard of 1.85:1. The format was briefly revived by [[Lucasfilm]] in the late 1970s for special effects work that required larger negative size (due to image degradation from the optical printing steps necessary to make multi-layer composites). It went into obsolescence largely due to better cameras, lenses, and film stocks available to standard four-perforation formats, in addition to increased lab costs of making prints in comparison to more standard vertical processes. (The horizontal process was also adapted to 70&nbsp;mm film by [[IMAX]], which was first shown at the Osaka '70 Worlds Fair.)\n\n[[16&nbsp;mm film|Super 16&nbsp;mm film]] was frequently used for television production due to its lower cost, lack of need for soundtrack space on the film itself (as it is not projected but rather transferred to video), and aspect ratio similar to 16:9 (the native ratio of Super 16&nbsp;mm is 15:9). It also can be blown up to 35&nbsp;mm for theatrical release and therefore is sometimes used for feature films.\n\n== Current video standards ==\n\n=== 1:1 (Square) ===\nSquare displays are rarely used in devices<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_passport-6457.php|title=BlackBerry Passport \u2013 Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_smartwatch_3_swr50-7691.php|title=Sony SmartWatch 3 SWR50 \u2013 Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> and monitors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/news/eizos-27-inch-3k-display-is-perfectly-square-1610009/|title=Eizo's 27-inch 3K display is perfectly square - Geek.com|date=2014-11-20|work=Geek.com|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Nonetheless, video consumption on social apps has grown rapidly and led to the emergence of new video formats more suited to mobile devices that can be held in horizontal and vertical orientations. In that sense, square video was popularized by mobile apps such as [[Instagram]] and has since been supported by other major social platforms including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. It can fill nearly twice as much screen space compared to 16:9 format (when the device is held differently while viewing from how video was recorded).\n\n=== 4:3 standard ===\n{{main|Fullscreen (filmmaking)}}\n4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1) (generally read as Four-Three, Four-by-Three, or Four-to-Three) for standard television has been in use since the invention of [[movie camera|moving picture camera]]s and many [[computer monitor]]s used to employ the same aspect ratio. 4:3 was the aspect ratio used for [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm films]] in the [[silent film|silent era]]. It is also very close to the 1.375:1 [[Academy ratio]], defined by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as a standard after the advent of optical [[sound-on-film]]. By having TV match this aspect ratio, movies originally photographed on 35&nbsp;mm film could be satisfactorily viewed on TV in the early days of the medium (i.e. the 1940s and the 1950s). \n\nWith the adoption of [[High-definition television|high definition television]], the majority of modern televisions are now produced with 16:9 displays instead. Apple's [[iPad]] series of [[tablet computer|tablets]], however, continue to use 4:3 displays (despite other Apple products typically using widescreen aspect ratios) to better suit use as an [[e-reader]]. But the 2018 iPad Pro 11 inch uses a 1.43:1 Aspect ratio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1146035/ipad-screen.html|title=Why Apple chose the iPad's screen format|last=McElhearn|first=Kirk|date=2010-02-01|website=Macworld|language=en|access-date=2019-07-24|}}</ref>\n\n=== 16:9 standard ===\n{{Main|16:9 aspect ratio}}\n[[16:9 aspect ratio|16:9]] (1.{{overline|7}}:1) (generally named as Sixteen-by-Nine, Sixteen-Nine, and Sixteen-to-Nine) is the international standard format of [[High-definition television|HDTV]], non-HD digital [[television]] and analog widescreen television [[PALplus]]. Japan's [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|Hi-Vision]] originally started with a 5:3 (= 15:9) ratio but converted when the international standards group introduced a wider ratio of 5\u2153 to 3 (= 16:9). Many [[digital video]] cameras have the capability to record in 16:9 (= 4<sup>2</sup>:3<sup>2</sup>), and 16:9 is the only widescreen aspect ratio natively supported by the [[DVD-Video#Frame size and frame rate|DVD]] standard. DVD producers can also choose to show even wider ratios such as 1.85:1 and 2.39:1<ref name=\"anamorphic\" /> within the 16:9 DVD frame by [[hard matting]] or adding black bars within the image itself. However, it was used often in British TVs in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1990s.

When projected, image have an approximated 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 (often rounded to 2.4:1) aspect ratio. \"21:9 aspect ratio\" is actually 64:27 (= 4<sup>3</sup>:3<sup>3</sup>), or approximately 2.37:1, and is a near both cinematic movie aspect ratios.\n\nMobile devices are now starting to use the 21:9 format, such as the [[Sony Xperia 1]].\n\n=== Vertical video ===\nAnother trend arising from the massive use of smartphones is [[Vertical video]] (9:16), that is intended for viewing in [[Page orientation|portrait mode]]. It was popularized by [[Snapchat]] and is also now being adopted by Twitter and Facebook. Instagram stories are based on this aspect ratio as well.\n\n== Obtaining height, width, and area of the screen ==\nOften, screen specifications are given by their diagonal length. The following formulae can be used to find the height (''h''), width (''w'') and area (''A''), where ''r'' stands for ratio, written as a fraction, and ''d'' for diagonal length.\n\n:<math>h=\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{r^2+1}} \\qquad w=\\frac{r\\times d}{\\sqrt{{r^2}+1}}  \\qquad A=\\frac{r\\times d^2}{{r^2}+1}=\\frac{d^2}{r+\\frac{1}{r}}</math>\n\n== Distinctions ==\n{{Further|Pixel aspect ratio}}\nThis article primarily addresses the aspect ratio of images ''as displayed,'' which is more formally referred to as the ''display aspect ratio'' (DAR). In [[digital image]]s, there is a distinction with the ''{{visible anchor|storage aspect ratio}}'' (SAR), which is the ratio of [[pixel dimensions]]. If an image is displayed with [[square pixel]]s, then these ratios agree; if not, then non-square, \"rectangular\" pixels are used, and these ratios disagree. The aspect ratio of the pixels themselves is known as the [[pixel aspect ratio]] (PAR) \u2013 for square pixels this is 1:1 \u2013 and these are related by the identity:\n:SAR&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;PAR&nbsp;=&nbsp;DAR.\nRearranging (solving for PAR) yields:\n:PAR&nbsp;=&nbsp;DAR/SAR.\nFor example, a 640&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;480 [[VGA]] image has a SAR of 640/480 = 4:3, and if displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), has square pixels, hence a PAR of 1:1. By contrast, a 720&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;576 [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]] PAL image has a SAR of 720/576 = 5:4, but is displayed on a 4:3 display (DAR = 4:3), so by this formula it would have a PAR of (4:3)/(5:4) = 16:15.\n\nHowever, because standard definition digital video was originally based on digitally sampling analog television, the 720 horizontal pixels actually capture a slightly wider image to avoid loss of the original analog picture. In actual images, these extra pixels are often partly or entirely black, as only the center 704 horizontal pixels carry actual 4:3 or 16:9 image. Hence, the actual pixel aspect ratio for PAL video is a little different from that given by the formula, specifically 12:11 for PAL and 10:11 for NTSC. For consistency, the same effective pixel aspect ratios are used even for standard definition digital video originated in digital form rather than converted from analog. For more details refer to the [[Pixel aspect ratio#Analog-to-digital conversion|main article]].\n\nIn analog images such as film there is no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, and \"aspect ratio\" refers unambiguously to DAR. Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though digital sensors might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.\n\nNon-square pixels arise often in early digital TV standards, related to digitalization of analog TV signals \u2013 whose horizontal and vertical resolutions differ and are thus best described by non-square pixels \u2013 and also in some digital videocameras and computer [[display mode]]s, such as [[Color Graphics Adapter]] (CGA). Today they arise particularly in [[transcoding]] between resolutions with different SARs.\n\nDAR is also known as ''image aspect ratio'' and ''picture aspect ratio'', though the latter can be confused with ''pixel'' aspect ratio.\n\n== Visual comparisons ==\nComparing two different aspect ratios poses some subtleties \u2013 when comparing two aspect ratios, one may compare images with equal height, equal width, equal diagonal, or equal area. More amorphous questions include whether particular subject matter has a natural aspect ratio (panoramas being wide, full-length images of people being tall), or whether a particular ratio is more or less aesthetically pleasing, for example the [[golden ratio]] (~1.618).\n\nTelevisions and other displays typically list their size by their diagonal. Given the same diagonal, a 4:3 screen has more area compared to 16:9. For CRT-based technology, an aspect ratio that is closer to square is cheaper to manufacture. The same is true for projectors, and other optical devices such as cameras, camcorders, etc. For LCD and plasma displays, however, the cost is more related to the area. Producing wider and shorter screens can yield the same advertised diagonal, but with less area.\n\nThe following compares crops of an image at 4:3 and 16:9 ratios, with different dimensions set equal. Note that either image (or both) can be cropped; one aspect doesn't necessarily show more detail than the other.\n\n* Images using the same diagonal size:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example3.jpg|thumbnail|center|310px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n* Images using the same area / same number of pixels:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example4.jpg|thumbnail|center|283px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example4.jpg|thumbnail|center|327px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n* Images using the same height / same vertical size:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|380px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n* Images using the same width/ same horizontal size:\n{|\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 4 3 example.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)]]\n| [[File:Aspect ratio 16 9 example2.jpg|thumbnail|center|284px|16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)]]\n|}\n\n== Previous and currently used aspect ratios ==\n:''See [[list of common resolutions]] for a listing of computer resolutions and aspect ratios.''\n:''See [[list of film formats]] for a full listing of film formats, including their aspect ratios.''\n[[File:Filmaspectratios.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of several film aspect ratios with the heights forced to be equal.]]\n\n* '''1.19:1 (19:16)''': Sometimes referred to as the [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] ratio, this ratio was used briefly during the transitional period when the film industry was converting to sound, from 1926 to 1932 approx. It is produced by superimposing an optical soundtrack over a full-gate 1.{{overline|3}} aperture in printing, resulting in an almost square image. Films shot in this ratio are often projected or transferred to video incorrectly using a 1.37 mask or squashed to 1.37.

Used in subsequent Disney theme parks and other past applications.\n\n== Aspect ratio releases ==\n\n=== Original aspect ratio (OAR) ===\n\n''Original Aspect Ratio'' (OAR) is a [[home cinema]] term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a [[film]] or visual production was produced \u2013 as envisioned by the people involved in the creation of the work. As an example, the film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' was released to theaters in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. It was filmed in [[Super 35]] and, in addition to being presented in cinemas and television in the Original Aspect Ratio of 2.39:1, it was also broadcast without the [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]], altering the aspect ratio to the television standard of 1.{{overline|3}}:1. Because of the varied ways in which films are shot, IAR (Intended Aspect Ratio) is a more appropriate term, but is rarely used.\n\n=== Modified aspect ratio (MAR) ===\n\n''Modified Aspect Ratio'' is a home cinema term for the aspect ratio or dimensions in which a film was modified to fit a specific type of screen, as opposed to original aspect ratio. Modified aspect ratios are usually either 1.{{overline|3}}:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.{{overline|7}}:1 aspect ratio. 1.{{overline|3}}:1 is the modified aspect ratio used historically in VHS format. A modified aspect ratio transfer is achieved by means of [[pan and scan]] or [[open matte]], the latter meaning removing the cinematic matte from a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.{{overline|3}}:1 frame. Another name for it is \"prescaled\" aspect ratio\".\n\n== Problems in film and television ==\n[[File:Windowboxed.jpg|thumb|right|375px|A [[windowbox (film)|windowboxed]] image]]\n\nMultiple aspect ratios create additional burdens on directors and the public, and confusion among TV broadcasters. It is common for a widescreen film to be presented in an altered format ([[cropping (image)|cropped]], [[letterbox]]ed or expanded beyond the original aspect ratio). It is also not uncommon for [[windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] to occur (when letterbox and pillarbox happen simultaneously). For instance, a 16:9 broadcast could embed a 4:3 commercial within the 16:9 image area. A viewer watching on a standard 4:3 (non-widescreen) television would see a 4:3 image of the commercial with 2 sets of black stripes, vertical and horizontal ([[windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] or the [[Matchboxing#Pillarboxing and gutterboxing|postage stamp]] effect). A similar scenario may also occur for a widescreen set owner when viewing 16:9 material embedded in a 4:3 frame, and then watching that in 16:9. [[Active Format Description]] is a mechanism used in digital broadcasting to avoid this problem. It is also common that a 4:3 image is stretched horizontally to fit a 16:9 screen to avoid [[letterbox|pillar boxing]] but distorts the image so subjects appear short and fat.\n\nBoth PAL and NTSC have provision for some data pulses contained within the video signal used to signal the aspect ratio (See ITU-R BT.1119-1 \u2013 [[Widescreen signaling]] for broadcasting). These pulses are detected by television sets that have widescreen displays and cause the television to automatically switch to 16:9 display mode. When 4:3 material is included (such as the aforementioned commercial), the television switches to a 4:3 display mode to correctly display the material. Where a video signal is transmitted via a European [[SCART]] connection, one of the status lines is used to signal 16:9 material as well.\n\n== Still photography ==\nCommon aspect ratios in [[photography|still photography]] include:\n\n* 1:1\n* 5:4 (1.25:1)\n* 4:3 (1.{{overline|3}}:1)\n* 3:2 (1.5:1)\n* 5:3 (1.{{overline|6}}:1)\n* 16:9 (1.{{overline|7}}:1)\n* 3:1\n\nMany digital still cameras offer user options for selecting multiple image aspect ratios. Some achieve this through the use of multi-aspect sensors (notably [[Panasonic]]), while others simply crop their native image format to have the output match the desired image aspect ratio.\n\n=== 1:1 ===\n\nIs the classic Kodak image, and is available as a choice in some digital still cameras, and hearkens back to the days of film cameras when the square image was popular with photographers using twin lens reflex cameras. These medium format cameras used [[120 film]] rolled onto spools. The 6 \u00d7 6&nbsp;cm image size was the classic 1:1 format in the recent past. 120 film can still be found and used today. Many [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[instant film]]s were designed as square formats. Furthermore, up until August 2015, photo-sharing site [[Instagram]] only allowed users to upload images in 1:1 format. In 2017, Fujifilm added the 1:1 [[Instax#Instax Square|Instax Square]] format to their lineup of instant film cameras.\n\n=== 5:4 ===\n\nCommon in large and medium format photography, and still in common use for prints from digital cameras in the 8\"\u00d710\" size.\n\n=== 4:3 ===\nIs used by most digital [[point-and-shoot camera]]s, [[Four Thirds system]], [[Micro Four Thirds system]] cameras and [[medium format]] 645 cameras. The 4:3 digital format popularity was developed to match the then prevailing digital displays of the time, 4:3 computer monitors.\n\nThe next several formats have their roots in classic film photography image sizes, both the classic 35&nbsp;mm film camera, and the multiple format [[Advanced Photo System]] ([[Advanced Photo System|APS]]) film camera. The APS camera was capable of selecting any of three image formats, APS-H (\"High Definition\" mode), APS-C (\"Classic\" mode) and APS-P (\"Panoramic\" mode).\n\n=== 3:2 ===\nis used by classic [[135 film|35&nbsp;mm film]] cameras using a 24&nbsp;mm \u00d7 36&nbsp;mm image size, and their digital derivatives represented by [[DSLR]]s. Typical DSLRs come in two flavors, the so-called professional \"full frame\" (24&nbsp;mm \u00d7 36&nbsp;mm) sensors and variations of smaller, so called \"APS-C\" sensors. The term \"APS\" is derived from another film format known as\nthe [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] and the \"-C\" refers to \"Classic\" mode, which exposed images over a smaller area (25.1&nbsp;mm \u00d7 16.7&nbsp;mm) but retaining the same \"classic\" 3:2 proportions as full frame 35&nbsp;mm film cameras.\n\nWhen discussing DSLR's and their non-SLR derivatives, the term APS-C has become an almost generic term. The two major camera manufacturers [[Canon (company)|Canon]] and [[Nikon]] each developed and established sensor standards for their own versions of APS-C sized and proportioned sensors. Canon actually developed two standards, APS-C and a slightly larger area APS-H (not to be confused with the APS-H film format), while Nikon developed its own APS-C standard, which it calls [[Nikon DX format|DX]]. Regardless of the different flavors of sensors, and their varying sizes, they are close enough to the original APS-C image size, and maintain the classic 3:2 image proportions that these sensors are generally known as an \"APS-C\" sized sensor.\n\nThe reason for DSLR's image sensors being the flatter 3:2 versus the taller point-and-shoot 4:3 is that DSLRs were designed to match the legacy 35&nbsp;mm SLR film, whereas the majority of digital cameras were designed to match the predominant computer displays of the time, with VGA, SVGA, XGA and UXGA all being 4:3. Widescreen computer monitors did not become popular until the advent of [[HDTV]], which uses a 16:9 image aspect ratio.\n\n=== 16:9 ===\n16:9 is another format that has its roots in the APS film camera.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Known as APS-H (30.2&nbsp;mm \u00d7 16.7&nbsp;mm), with the \"-H\" denoting \"High Definition\", the 16:9 format is also the standard image aspect ratio for HDTV. 16:9 is gaining popularity as a format in all classes of consumer still cameras which also shoot High Definition ([[high-definition video|HD]]) [[video]]. When still cameras have an HD video capability, some can also record stills in the 16:9 format, ideal for display on HD televisions and widescreen computer displays.\n\n=== 3:1 ===\nis another format that can find its roots in the APS film camera. Known as APS-P (30.2 \u00d7 9.5&nbsp;mm), with the -P\" denoting \"Panorama\", the 3:1 format was used for [[panorama]] photography. The APS-P panorama standard is the least adhered to any APS standard, and panoramic implementation varies with by manufacturer on different cameras, with the only commonality being that the image is much longer than it is tall, in the classic \"panorama\" style.\n\nCommon [[Photo print sizes|print sizes]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] (in [[inch]]es) include 4\u00d76 (1.5), 5\u00d77 (1.4), 4\u00d75 and 8\u00d710 (1.25), and 11\u00d714 (1.27); [[large format]] cameras typically use one of these aspect ratios. [[Medium format (film)|Medium-format]] cameras typically have format designated by nominal sizes in centimeters (6\u00d76, 6\u00d77, 6\u00d79, 6\u00d74.5), but these numbers should not be interpreted as exact in computing aspect ratios. For example, the usable height of [[120 film|120-format roll film]] is 56mm, so a width of 70mm (as in 6\u00d77) yields an aspect ratio of 4:5 \u2014 ideal for enlarging to make an 8\u00d710\" portrait. Print sizes are usually defined by their portrait dimensions (tall) while equipment aspect ratios are defined by their landscape dimensions (wide, flipped sideways). A good example of this a 4\u00d76 print (6&nbsp;inch wide by 4&nbsp;inch tall landscape) perfectly matches the 3:2 aspect ratio of a DSLR/35&nbsp;mm, since 6/2=3 and 4/2=2.\n\nFor analog projection of photographic slides, projector and screen use a 1:1 aspect ratio, supporting horizontal and vertical orientation equally well. In contrast, digital projection technology typically supports vertically oriented images only at a fraction of the resolution of landscape-oriented images. For example, projecting a digital still image having a 3:2 aspect ratio on a 16:9 projector employs 84.3% of available resolution in horizontal orientation, but only 37.5% in vertical orientation.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Active Format Description]] (AFD)\n* [[Index of motion picture terminology]]\n* [[Paper size]]\n* [[Shoot and protect]]\n* [[Glossary of video terms]]\n* [[Ultrawide formats]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{commons category|Aspect ratio}}\n\n=== On Aspect Ratios ===\n\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm |title=NEC Monitor Technology Guide |accessdate=2006-07-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060521000427/http://www.necdisplay.com/support/css/monitortechguide/index05.htm  |archivedate = 2006-05-21}}\n*[http://www.widescreen.org/ The Letterbox and Widescreen Advocacy Page]\n*[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/index.htm American Widescreen Museum]\n*[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/apertures.htm Widescreen Apertures and Aspect Ratios]\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207004356/http://aspect.fre3.com |date=December 7, 2013 |title=Aspect \u2013 combined aspect ratio, frame size and bitrate calculator }}\n* Aspect Ratios Explained: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090624175845/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/DVDs/AspectRatios/ Part 1] [http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/aspect-ratios-explained-part-two.html Part 2]\n*[http://bitbucket.co.uk/work/aspect_ratios.html Explanation of TV Aspect Ratio format description codes]\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624175845/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/DVDs/AspectRatios/ |date=June 24, 2009 |title=IMDb \u2013 Number of DVDs for each aspect ratio }}\n*[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993D0424:EN:HTML SCADplus: 16:9 Action plan for the television in the 16:9 screen format \u2013 European Union]\n\n=== Calculators ===\n*[https://aspect-ratio-calculator.com/ Calculate aspect ratio online]\n*{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-4.html#calculator |title=Calculator to Determine Size of 4:3 Image on 16:9 Screen |accessdate=2006-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801020257/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-4.html#calculator |archivedate=2010-08-01 }} (middle of the page)\n*[https://calculateaspectratio.com/ Aspect Ratio Calculator]\n*[https://www.ninjaunits.com/converters/pixels/ Pixel conversions]\n*[http://nxu.biz/tools/ARCalculator/ ARCalculator \u2013 A nice aspect ratio, image ratio, size converter and calculator]\n\n{{Fractions and ratios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aspect Ratio (Image)}}\n[[Category:Ratios]]\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n\n[[sq:16:9]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:3065:8700:905c:9617:5c2e:da0b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Clare e of a 6th grade school teacher who is not a)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)"}

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.
