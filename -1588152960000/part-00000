After shuffling, a [[Solitaire terminology|tableau]] of seven fanned piles of cards are laid from left to right. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards (one downturned, one upturned), the third contains three (two downturned, one upturned), and so on, until the seventh pile which contains seven cards (six downturned, one upturned). The topmost card of each pile is turned face up.  The remaining cards form the [[Talon (cards)|stock]] are placed facedown at the upper left of the layout.\n\nThe four [[Solitaire terminology|foundations]] (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be [[Solitaire terminology|built down by alternate colors]]. Every face-up card in a partial pile, or a complete pile, can be moved, as a unit, to another tableau pile on the basis of their highest card. Any empty piles can be filled with a King, or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up four stacks of cards starting with Ace and ending with King, all of the same suit, on one of the four foundations, at which time the player would have won.\nThere are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck from the stock to the [[Solitaire terminology|waste]], including the following:\n* Turning three cards at once to the waste, with no limit on passes through the deck.\n* Turning three cards at once to the waste, with three passes through the deck.\n* Turning one card at a time to the waste, with three passes through the deck.\n* Turning one card at a time to the waste with only a single pass through the deck, and playing it if possible.\n* Turning one card at a time to the waste, with no limit on passes through the deck.\n\nIf the player can no longer make any meaningful moves, the game is considered lost.

Thoughtful Klondike is not quite the same as simply playing with all cards face up, as this would allow an impossible movement of a pile if the top downturned card happened to be in sequence with the upturned card underneath it. Using physical cards, Thoughtful Klondike can be played by peeking at the face-down cards, while with electronic programs Thoughtful Klondike can be played by allowing unlimited use of undos to return to the start if a choice turns out to be unfavourable. \n \nBecause the only difference between the two games (regular and thoughtful) is the knowledge of card location, all thoughtful games with solutions will also have solutions in Klondike. Since any winnable Klondike game must necessarily be winnable when played thoughtfully, the results on Thoughtful Klondike tells us that 82% is an upper bound on the winnability of regular Klondike when we don't know the location of all cards.  The true probability with best play might be much smaller, because the difference between a right and wrong move cannot be known in advance whenever more than one move is possible and some cards are still hidden.  Ultimately, very little is known about the winnability of regular Klondike. The number of games a skilled player can probabilistically expect to win has been estimated as at least 43%<ref name=\"jsp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/KlondikeSolitaireReport.html|title=Winning Chances for Klondike Solitaire|publisher=}}</ref> , but this gives a massive gap of almost 40% between that number and 82%.\n\n== Scoring ==\nStandard scoring in the Windows Solitaire game is determined as follows:<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/101766/en-us Highest Score in Windows Solitaire], Microsoft Help and Support, KB101766.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, if the card is first moved to a Tableau, and then to a Foundation, then an extra 5 points are received for a total of 15.  Thus in order to receive a maximum score, no cards should be moved directly from the Waste to Foundation.\n\nTime can also play a factor in Windows Solitaire, if the '''Timed game''' option is selected.  For every 10 seconds of play, 2 points are taken away.  Bonus points are calculated with the formula of (20,000 / (seconds to finish)) * 35 (where / is integer division), if the game takes at least 30 seconds. If the game takes less than 30 seconds, no bonus points are awarded.\n\n== Variations ==\n\n===Single 52-card deck===\nBelow are some variations of the game of Klondike:\n* In '''[[Agnes (card game)|Agnes]]''', the stock is dealt in batches of seven on  reserve piles and every one is available. Furthermore, the bases of the foundations depends on the twenty-ninth card, which is dealt on the foundations.\n* In '''Easthaven''' (a.k.a. '''[[Aces Up]]'''), twenty-one cards are dealt into seven piles of three, two face-down and one face-up. A space in this game can only be filled by a king or any sequence starting with a king (although they can simplify the rule and put any card or a sequence in an empty space, as it does in several rules), and when a play goes to a standstill, seven new cards are dealt to the tableau, one top of each pile. Easthaven may include 2 or 3 card decks. The two deck version is either called Double Easthaven or Gypsy.\n* In '''Nine Across''' nine columns of cards are dealt, as opposed to the seven of conventional Klondike. The player can choose which cards to form the foundations; if one or more eights are exposed, for example, the player may decide to build on eights, and the piles are built up 8-9-10-J-Q-K-Ace-2-3-4-5-6-7. If eights are built on, sevens fill up spaces and so forth. The stock is dealt through one by one as many times as required.\n* In '''Thumb and Pouch''', a card in the tableau can be built upon another that is any suit other than its own (e.g. spades cannot be placed over spades) and spaces can be filled by any card or sequence.\n* In '''Whitehead''', ''all'' cards are dealt face up, building is by color (red on red, black on black), a sequence made up of cards that are of the same suit can be moved as a unit, and a space can be filled by any card or sequence.\n* In '''[[Westcliff (solitaire)|Westcliff]]''', thirty cards are dealt into ten piles of three cards, two face down and one face up. A space in this game can be filled with any card or sequence.\n\n=== Tarot deck ===\nThe game can be played with a Tarot-style 78-card deck (such as a [[Tarot Nouveau]]).  There are two ways of doing this.  Each has nine increasing tableau stacks.\n* Klondike Nouveau Run: use five foundations, and either use the Fool as the first card in the trumps foundation, or remove it before playing.  The Knight (Chevalier) appears between the Jack and the Queen.\n* Klondike Tarot Evens: use six foundations; the usual four, and then use the red knights (cavaliers) as the royals for trumps 1-10, and the black knights as the royals for trumps 11-21.\n\n== Computerized versions ==\n* The [[Atari Program Exchange]] published Mark Reid's implementation of Klondike for the [[Atari 8-bit family]], simply titled ''Solitaire'', in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solitaire|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-solitaire_4788.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref>\n* Michael A.

An increase of $0\u2013$500 per capita income to $500\u2013$1000 per capita income can lead to a decrease in child labour incidence rate from 30%\u201360% to 10%\u201330%.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /> Although the annual per capita income of Bangladesh has been increasing, around 9\u201313% of the total labour force in Bangladesh still consists of children aged 5\u201314.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimates that around 43.3% of the population in Bangladesh is currently living below the international poverty line.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/bangladesh_bangladesh_statistics.html |title=Bangladesh: Statistics |date=18 December 2013 |website=UNICEF |accessdate = 15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFactors such as urbanization and population growth perpetuate poverty.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> In a 2013 statistical report, UNICEF estimated an annual population growth rate in Bangladesh to be 1.7% from 1990\u20132012.<ref name=\":5\" /> Populations move from rural to urban areas because there is an increase in available economic opportunities. A combination of poor living standards in urban settings and an influx of cheap labour from children perpetuate both poverty and the use of child labour.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> The prevalence of child labour can be attributed to the socioeconomic statuses of families living at or below the poverty line. Oftentimes, families rely on the extra income produced by their children in order to sustain their livelihood. Many children are forced to work to help support the family. In other cases, children are forced to work for a living for themselves because their families abandoned or could not take care of them. Studies have shown that children from poorer families are more likely to be in the work force due to their contribution to overall family income.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\n===Demographics===\n[[File:Boys in red.jpg|thumb|Boys covered with mercury-containing red [[vermilion]] chemical during child labour in a factory producing [[sindoor]].]]\nThe [[demographics of Bangladesh|demographics of the population in Bangladesh]] can also be a predictor of child labour incidence rates. Children in rural areas are more likely to work than children in urban areas.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /> This may be due to the agricultural history of Bangladesh and the tradition of children working alongside adults in the fields.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /> However, in both rural and urban settings, boys are more likely to work than girls, with the majority of child workers falling in the age range of 12\u201314.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\nFamily dynamics also contributed to child labour incidence rates. Children in households with a large proportion of adults in the family are less likely to work. Children in households where all adults are working are more likely to work. Children in households where there is a larger portion of paid adult workers are even more likely to work. These findings by Salmon (2005) indicate that children act as a source of income generation because households that maximise all human capital tend to be households that have incidences of child labour.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" />\n\n===Lack of education===\n{{main|Education in Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Community Box Library in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|left|Community Box Library in Bangladesh]]\nLack of education remains one of the top impacts of child labour.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"ILO2006\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /><ref name=\"HobbsMcKechnie1999\" /> Child labour is a deterrent to schooling.<ref name=\"BDRC2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshstudies.org/files/WPS_no8.pdf |title=Physical and Psychological Implications of Risky Child Labor: A Study in Sylhet City, Bangladesh |last1=Uddin |first1=Mohammad Nashir |last2=Hamiduzzaman |first2=Mohammad |last3=Gunter |first3=Bernhard G. |date=July 2009 |website=Bangladesh Development Research Center (BDRC)}}</ref> Many policies aimed at eradicating child labour have focused on increasing accessibility to education. Organizations such as the ILO, the United Nations, and UNICEF recognise the importance of education in helping to eradicate poverty and in preventing child labour growth rates.<ref name=\"ILO2006\" /><ref name=\"HobbsMcKechnie1999\" /> According to UNICEF, the new National Education Policy requires that children must complete school until grade eight and that school must be free.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many definitions of child labour state education as a right of childhood and consider barriers to education as a defining characteristic of child labour.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" />\n\nThere is a strong relationship between child labour and school attendance.

A combination of poor living standards in urban settings and an influx of cheap labour from children perpetuate both poverty and the use of child labour.<ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /> The prevalence of child labour can be attributed to the socioeconomic statuses of families living at or below the poverty line. Oftentimes, families rely on the extra income produced by their children in order to sustain their livelihood. Many children are forced to work to help support the family. In other cases, children are forced to work for a living for themselves because their families abandoned or could not take care of them.

Children in households with a large proportion of adults in the family are less likely to work. Children in households where all adults are working are more likely to work. Children in households where there is a larger portion of paid adult workers are even more likely to work. These findings by Salmon (2005) indicate that children act as a source of income generation because households that maximise all human capital tend to be households that have incidences of child labour.<ref name=\"Salmon2005\" />\n\n===Lack of education===\n{{main|Education in Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Community Box Library in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|left|Community Box Library in Bangladesh]]\nLack of education remains one of the top impacts of child labour.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"SchmitzTraver2004\" /><ref name=\"ILO2006\" /><ref name=\"Salmon2005\" /><ref name=\"Rahman1999\" /><ref name=\"HobbsMcKechnie1999\" /> Child labour is a deterrent to schooling.<ref name=\"BDRC2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshstudies.org/files/WPS_no8.pdf |title=Physical and Psychological Implications of Risky Child Labor: A Study in Sylhet City, Bangladesh |last1=Uddin |first1=Mohammad Nashir |last2=Hamiduzzaman |first2=Mohammad |last3=Gunter |first3=Bernhard G. |date=July 2009 |website=Bangladesh Development Research Center (BDRC)}}</ref> Many policies aimed at eradicating child labour have focused on increasing accessibility to education.

Article 34 lays down that 'all forms of forced labor are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offense punishable in accordance with law'.\n\n;The Children Act 2013\n\nThe Children Act 2013 repealed the previous Children Act 1974 which was inconsistent with international standards particularly with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989. Section 4 of this Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force every person shall be deemed to be a child who is below the age of 18 years. Though there is no specific provision prohibiting child labor it proscribes and punishes some serious offenses against children including exploitation of children (section 80).\n\n=== Applicable laws from other legal jurisdictions ===\n;The Child Labor Deterrence Act 1993 (Harkin's Bill)\n{{main|Child Labor Deterrence Act}}\nOriginating from U.S. Senator [[Tom Harkin]], this bill banned imports of items that were associated with child labour at various stages of production, whether it was direct involvement in the product or indirect involvement such as packaging. This law affected the labour situation in Bangladesh because garment industries, fearing a loss of business, fired many child labourers.<ref name=\"Rahman1999\" />\n\n;Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act 2012\n\nAccording to the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) United States Department of Labor:<blockquote>In 2011, Bangladesh made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Bangladesh passed the Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act 2012 which makes [[human trafficking]] (including labor trafficking) a [[Capital punishment|capital offense]], developed and fully funded a Child Labor Monitoring Information System to manage child labor related data and began implementation of a $9 million child labor project. However, legal protections regarding child labor are limited and the capacity to enforce child labor laws remains weak. Bangladesh maintains a low [[compulsory education]] age. Children in Bangladesh are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, primarily in dangerous activities in agriculture and domestic service.<ref name=\"OCFT2011\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe legislation tried to enroll more children and adults into school and away from work. This was not the outcome.  Some children enrolled in school, but many sought other work.  Due to the law, many kids took more dangerous jobs in the informal economy, including; [[child prostitution|prostitution]], [[hawker (trade)|street hawkers]], stone welding, and as maids.<ref>{{cite book |last=Furlong |first=Andy |date=2012 |title=Youth Studies: An Introduction |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-18992-1}}</ref>   Schooling is compulsory only to age 10.

It also provided families with income to make up for their child's lack of work. This program is also called \"The Placement of Children Workers in School Programs and the Elimination of Child Labor.\" The MOU has made an impact in reducing child labour in the garment industry in Bangladesh.

{"title_page": "Ramadan (calendar month)", "text_new": "{{About|the Islamic calendar month called Ramadan|information about the holiday and religious observances during that month of the same name|Ramadan|other uses|Ramadan (disambiguation)}}\n{{muslimmonths}}\n{{Refimprove|talk=true|date=January 2019}}\nThe month of '''Ramadan''' ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0646}}, ''{{transl|ar|Rama\u1e0d\u0101n}}''), also spelled '''Ramadhan''' or '''Ramazan''', is the ninth month of the [[Islamic calendar]], and the month in which the [[Quran]] was revealed to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].\n \n[[Sawm|Fasting]] during the month of Ramadan is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The month is spent by [[Muslim]]s fasting during the daylight hours from dawn to sunset. According to Islam, the Quran was sent down to the lowest [[heaven]] during this month, thus being prepared for gradual revelation by [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Jibreel]]  to Muhammad. Therefore, Muhammad told his followers that the gates of [[Jannah|Heaven]] would be open for the entire month and the gates of [[Hell]] ([[Jahannam]]) would be closed.<ref name=\"Hadith al-Bukhari 3:123\">[http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2467-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-123.html Hadith al-Bukhari 3:123] Hadith Collection</ref> The first day of the next month, [[Shawwal]], is spent in celebration and is observed as the \"Festival of Breaking Fast\" or [[Eid al-Fitr]].\n\n==Timing==\nThe calendar is a [[lunar calendar]], and months begin when the first [[crescent]] of a [[new moon]] is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 10 to 11 days shorter than the [[Tropical year|solar year]] and contains no [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]], Ramadan migrates throughout the seasons. The Islamic day starts after sunset. The estimated start and end dates for Ramadan, based on the Umm al-Qura calendar<ref>[https://hamariweb.com/islam/country-ramadan-timings.aspx Ramadan Calendar], Hamariweb</ref> of Saudi Arabia, are:<ref>[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/ummalqura.htm Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia]</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Ramadan dates between 2018 and 2023\n|-\n![[Anno Hegirae|AH]]\n!First day ([[Common Era|CE]]/[[Anno Domini|AD]])\n!Last day ([[Common Era|CE]]/[[Anno Domini|AD]])\n|-\n|1439\n|17 May 2018\n|14 June 2018\n|-\n|1440\n|{{0}}6 May 2019\n|{{0}}3 June 2019\n|-\n|1441\n|24 April 2020\n|23 May 2020\n|-\n|1442\n|13 April 2021\n|12 May 2021\n|-\n|1443\n|{{0}}2 April 2022\n|{{0}}1 May 2022\n|-\n|1444\n|23 March 2023\n|20 April 2023\n|}\n\nMany Muslims insist on the local physical sighting of the moon to mark the beginning of Ramadan, but others use the calculated time of the new moon or the [[Saudi Arabian]] declaration to determine the start of the month. Since the new moon is not in the same state at the same time globally, the beginning and ending dates of Ramadan depend on what lunar sightings are received in each respective location. As a result, Ramadan dates vary in different countries, but usually only by a day. This is due to the [[Lunar month|cycle of the moon]]. The moon travels the same path all year round and when the moon is seen in the east, it is then seen traveling towards the west. All the countries around the world see the moon within a 24-hour period once spotted by one country in the east.\n[[File:An Iranian iftar meal (2).jpg|thumb|An iftar  meal]]\n\nEach year, Ramadan begins about eleven days earlier than in the previous year.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.ramadan.com.au/faq\n | title = What is the Islamic calendar?\n | work = FAQ - For Muslims\n | publisher = Ramadan Awareness Campaign\n}}</ref> Astronomical projections that approximate the start of Ramadan are available.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://moonsighting.com/ramadan.html\n | title = Ramadan and Eidian | accessdate = 7 August 2012\n | publisher = Committee For Crescent Observation\n}}</ref>\n33 Islamic years are approximately equal to 32 tropical years, with six days over.\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Martyrdom of Imam Ali - By Yousef Abdinejad.jp.jpg|thumb|Martyrdom of [[Ali]]]]\n[[Ramadan]] is observed by Muslims during the entire lunar month by the same name. The month of religious observances consists of fasting and extra prayers. Some important historical events during this month are generally believed to include:\n* 1 Ramadan, birth of [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]\n* 2 Ramadan, the [[Torah]] was bestowed on [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] according to Islam\n* 10 Ramadan, death of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]], [[Muhammad's wives|first wife]] of Muhammad\n* 10 Ramadan, in 1973, [[Operation Badr (1973)|Operation Badr]] took place, starting the [[Yom Kippur War]]\n* 12 Ramadan, the [[Gospel in Islam|Gospel]] was bestowed on [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] according to Islam\n* 15 Ramadan, birth of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]\n* 15 Ramadan, during the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Sultan presented trays of [[baklava]] to the [[Janissaries]] in a ceremonial procession called the Baklava Alay\u0131\n* 17 Ramadan, birth of [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn \u02bfArabi]]\n* 17 Ramadan, death of [[Aisha|Aisha bint Abu Bakr]] \u2013 [[Muhammad's wives|third wife]] of Muhammad\n* 17 Ramadan, death of [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayyah]] daughter of Muhammad and [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]], wife of [[Uthman]]\n* 17 Ramadan, the [[Battle of Badr]] was won by the Muslims\n* 18 Ramadan, the [[Psalms]] ([[Zabur]]) were bestowed on [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawood]])\n* 19 Ramadan, [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Caliph]] [[Ali]] was struck on the head by a sword by an assassin while praying\n* 20 Ramadan, the [[Conquest of Mecca]] by Muhammad\n* 21 Ramadan, Caliph Ali died due to his injuries\n* 27 Ramadan, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] was established on 14 August 1947 (27 Ramadan 1366 in the Islamic calendar)<ref>http://www.pakistan.gov.pk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127012942/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/ |date=2006-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n[[Laylat al-Qadr]] is observed during one of the last ten days of the month (typically the odd nights). Muslims believe that this night which is also known as \"The Night of Power\" is better than a thousand months. This is often interpreted as praying throughout this night is rewarded equally with praying for a thousand months (just over 83 years i.e., a lifetime). Many Muslims spend the entire night in prayer.\n\n==Hadith==\nIn [[Islamic eschatology]]:\n* [[Abu Hurairah]] said that the Prophet said:\n<blockquote>There will be an [[Ayah]] (sign) in [the month of] Ramadan. Then, there will 'isabah (splitting into groups) in [[Shawwal]]. Then, there will be fighting in [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]]. Then, the pilgrim will be robbed in [[Dhu al-Hijjah]]. Then, the prohibitions will be violated in [[Muharram|al-Muharram]]. Then, there will be sound in [[Safar]], then the tribes will conflict with each other in the two months of [[Rabi' al-Awwal]] & [[Rabi' al-Thani]]. Then, the most amazing thing will happen between [[Jumada (disambiguation)|Jumada]] and [[Rajab]].

The estimated start and end dates for Ramadan, based on the Umm al-Qura calendar<ref>[https://hamariweb.com/islam/country-ramadan-timings.aspx Ramadan Calendar], Hamariweb</ref> of Saudi Arabia, are:<ref>[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/ummalqura.htm Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia]</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Ramadan dates between 2018 and 2023\n|-\n![[Anno Hegirae|AH]]\n!First day ([[Common Era|CE]]/[[Anno Domini|AD]])\n!Last day ([[Common Era|CE]]/[[Anno Domini|AD]])\n|-\n|1439\n|17 May 2018\n|14 June 2018\n|-\n|1440\n|{{0}}6 May 2019\n|{{0}}3 June 2019\n|-\n|1441\n|24 April 2020\n|23 May 2020\n|-\n|1442\n|13 April 2021\n|12 May 2021\n|-\n|1443\n|{{0}}2 April 2022\n|{{0}}1 May 2022\n|-\n|1444\n|23 March 2023\n|20 April 2023\n|}\n\nMany Muslims insist on the local physical sighting of the moon to mark the beginning of Ramadan, but others use the calculated time of the new moon or the [[Saudi Arabian]] declaration to determine the start of the month. Since the new moon is not in the same state at the same time globally, the beginning and ending dates of Ramadan depend on what lunar sightings are received in each respective location. As a result, Ramadan dates vary in different countries, but usually only by a day. This is due to the [[Lunar month|cycle of the moon]]. The moon travels the same path all year round and when the moon is seen in the east, it is then seen traveling towards the west. All the countries around the world see the moon within a 24-hour period once spotted by one country in the east.\n[[File:An Iranian iftar meal (2).jpg|thumb|An iftar  meal]]\n\nEach year, Ramadan begins about eleven days earlier than in the previous year.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.ramadan.com.au/faq\n | title = What is the Islamic calendar?\n | work = FAQ - For Muslims\n | publisher = Ramadan Awareness Campaign\n}}</ref> Astronomical projections that approximate the start of Ramadan are available.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://moonsighting.com/ramadan.html\n | title = Ramadan and Eidian | accessdate = 7 August 2012\n | publisher = Committee For Crescent Observation\n}}</ref>\n33 Islamic years are approximately equal to 32 tropical years, with six days over.\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Martyrdom of Imam Ali - By Yousef Abdinejad.jp.jpg|thumb|Martyrdom of [[Ali]]]]\n[[Ramadan]] is observed by Muslims during the entire lunar month by the same name. The month of religious observances consists of fasting and extra prayers. Some important historical events during this month are generally believed to include:\n* 1 Ramadan, birth of [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]\n* 2 Ramadan, the [[Torah]] was bestowed on [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] according to Islam\n* 10 Ramadan, death of [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid]], [[Muhammad's wives|first wife]] of Muhammad\n* 10 Ramadan, in 1973, [[Operation Badr (1973)|Operation Badr]] took place, starting the [[Yom Kippur War]]\n* 12 Ramadan, the [[Gospel in Islam|Gospel]] was bestowed on [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] according to Islam\n* 15 Ramadan, birth of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]\n* 15 Ramadan, during the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Sultan presented trays of [[baklava]] to the [[Janissaries]] in a ceremonial procession called the Baklava Alay\u0131\n* 17 Ramadan, birth of [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn \u02bfArabi]]\n* 17 Ramadan, death of [[Aisha|Aisha bint Abu Bakr]] \u2013 [[Muhammad's wives|third wife]] of Muhammad\n* 17 Ramadan, death of [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayyah]] daughter of Muhammad and [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]], wife of [[Uthman]]\n* 17 Ramadan, the [[Battle of Badr]] was won by the Muslims\n* 18 Ramadan, the [[Psalms]] ([[Zabur]]) were bestowed on [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawood]])\n* 19 Ramadan, [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Caliph]] [[Ali]] was struck on the head by a sword by an assassin while praying\n* 20 Ramadan, the [[Conquest of Mecca]] by Muhammad\n* 21 Ramadan, Caliph Ali died due to his injuries\n* 27 Ramadan, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] was established on 14 August 1947 (27 Ramadan 1366 in the Islamic calendar)<ref>http://www.pakistan.gov.pk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127012942/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/ |date=2006-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n[[Laylat al-Qadr]] is observed during one of the last ten days of the month (typically the odd nights). Muslims believe that this night which is also known as \"The Night of Power\" is better than a thousand months. This is often interpreted as praying throughout this night is rewarded equally with praying for a thousand months (just over 83 years i.e., a lifetime). Many Muslims spend the entire night in prayer.\n\n==Hadith==\nIn [[Islamic eschatology]]:\n* [[Abu Hurairah]] said that the Prophet said:\n<blockquote>There will be an [[Ayah]] (sign) in [the month of] Ramadan. Then, there will 'isabah (splitting into groups) in [[Shawwal]]. Then, there will be fighting in [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]]. Then, the pilgrim will be robbed in [[Dhu al-Hijjah]]. Then, the prohibitions will be violated in [[Muharram|al-Muharram]]. Then, there will be sound in [[Safar]], then the tribes will conflict with each other in the two months of [[Rabi' al-Awwal]] & [[Rabi' al-Thani]]. Then, the most amazing thing will happen between [[Jumada (disambiguation)|Jumada]] and [[Rajab]]. At that time, a well-fed she-camel will be better than a fortress (castle) sheltering a thousand [people].<ref>Al-Haakim, [[Naim ibn Hammad]], Kitab Al-Fitan</ref>{{nonspecific|date=February 2019}}</blockquote>\n\n===Prohibition to pronounce the word Ramadan by itself===\n{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2020}}\nAccording to numerous hadiths, Ramadan is one of the [[names of God in Islam]], and as such it is prohibited to say only \"Ramadan\" in reference to the calendar month and that it is necessary to say the \"month of Ramadan\".\n\n====Sunni====\n{{quote|The Messenger of God (sa) said: Do not say \"Ramadan\", for verily Ramadan is a name from the names of Allah, rather say \"month of Ramadan\".<ref name=\"Al-Bayhaqi\">{{cite book |last=[[Al-Bayhaqi]] |first=Abu Bakr |title=[[Sunan al-Kubra lil Behaqi|Sunnan al-Kubra]] |language=Arabic |page=Vol. 4, Book 11, Ch. 6, Nu. 7904 |quote=\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u0650 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0649\u0670 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e: \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u06df \u00ab\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u00bb \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0643\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0642\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u06df \u00ab\u0634\u064e\u0647\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u00bb }}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|He (the Prophet Muhammad) hated them saying \"Ramadan\", and he said: \"Because it is a name from the names of Allah.
