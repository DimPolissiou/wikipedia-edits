He conceived of the characters in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office and named them after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name. The family debuted as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show called ''The Simpsons'', which debuted on December 17, 1989. The show was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to land in the top 30 ratings in a season (1990).\n\nThe show was controversial from its beginning and has made the news several times. In the early seasons, some parents and conservatives characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned ''The Simpsons'' merchandise and T-shirts. In January 1992, then-President [[George H. W. Bush]] made a speech during his re-election campaign in which he said: \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like [[the Waltons]] and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" In 2002, the show was nearly sued by the [[Rio de Janeiro]] tourist board for creating an unreal image of the city on the show.\n\n''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007. Previous attempts to create a film version of ''The Simpsons'' failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually, producers Brooks, Groening, [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]], and [[Richard Sakai]] began development of the film in 2001. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006. The film was a box office success, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.\n\n''The Simpsons'' eventually became the [[list of longest-running United States television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed ''[[Gunsmoke#Television version|Gunsmoke]]'' as the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10  Times The Simpsons Predicted the Future|url=http://alexnoudelman.com/10-times-the-simpsons-predicted-the-future/|publisher=alexnoudelman.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref> Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes}} episodes]] and its [[The Simpsons (season 30)|30th season]] started airing on September 30, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/11/04/the-simpsons-renewed-season-30-fox/|title=The Simpsons Renewed at Fox Through Record-Setting Season 30|author=Michael Ausiello|work=tvline.com}}</ref>\n\n==The Tracey Ullman shorts (1987\u20131989)==\n{{main|The Simpsons shorts}}\n[[File:Simpsons on Tracey Ullman.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[Simpson family]] as they first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]].'']]\nWhen producer [[James L.

Having seen one of cartoonist [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his ''Life in Hell'' series.<ref name=\"americasfirstfamily\">{{cite video |year=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family |medium=television documentary |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Groening later realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work, and passed on the offer. [[Richard Sakai]] contacted Groening to see if he had any other characters he would be willing to let Fox merchandise, and, in short, Groening developed a [[dysfunctional family]] that became the Simpsons. [[Garth Ancier]] contends that Groening created the characters at home and brought them the next day, while [[Phil Roman]] claims Groening sketched out the characters on the drive to Fox.<ref name=\"48-49\">{{harvnb|Ortved|2009 |pp=48\u201349}}</ref> Groening's account states he hurriedly formulated ''The Simpsons'' while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, which is the most common and famous story.<ref name=\"americasfirstfamily\"/><ref name=inter>{{cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subjectlink=Matt Groening |interviewer=David Bianculli |title=Fresh Air |work=[[National Public Radio]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008 |location=Philadelphia |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name, adapting an [[anagram]] of the word \"brat\".<ref name=\"americasfirstfamily\"/>\n\nFox negotiated a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, in which he retained a large portion of revenue from merchandising.<ref name=\"fifty\">{{harvnb|Ortved|2009 |p=50}}</ref> To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on [[Klasky Csupo]], a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply.

He conceived of the characters in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office and named them after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name. The family debuted as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show called ''The Simpsons'', which debuted on December 17, 1989. The show was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to land in the top 30 ratings in a season (1990).\n\nThe show was controversial from its beginning and has made the news several times. In the early seasons, some parents and conservatives characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned ''The Simpsons'' merchandise and T-shirts. In January 1992, then-President [[George H. W. Bush]] made a speech during his re-election campaign in which he said: \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like [[the Waltons]] and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" In 2002, the show was nearly sued by the [[Rio de Janeiro]] tourist board for creating an unreal image of the city on the show.\n\n''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007. Previous attempts to create a film version of ''The Simpsons'' failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually, producers Brooks, Groening, [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]], and [[Richard Sakai]] began development of the film in 2001. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006. The film was a box office success, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.\n\n''The Simpsons'' eventually became the [[list of longest-running United States television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed ''[[Gunsmoke#Television version|Gunsmoke]]'' as the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10  Times The Simpsons Predicted the Future|url=http://alexnoudelman.com/10-times-the-simpsons-predicted-the-future/|publisher=alexnoudelman.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref> Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes}} episodes]] and its [[The Simpsons (season 30)|30th season]] started airing on September 30, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/11/04/the-simpsons-renewed-season-30-fox/|title=The Simpsons Renewed at Fox Through Record-Setting Season 30|author=Michael Ausiello|work=tvline.com}}</ref>\n\n==The Tracey Ullman shorts (1987\u20131989)==\n{{main|The Simpsons shorts}}\n[[File:Simpsons on Tracey Ullman.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[Simpson family]] as they first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]].'']]\nWhen producer [[James L.

Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of the opening number in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', which speaks of London in unflattering terms.<ref name=\"Martin2\">{{cite video |title=DVD extra \"The Cajun Controversy\".
