He suggested that there existed some fundamental natural units for length, mass, time, and energy. He derived these units using only dimensional analysis of what he considered the most fundamental universal constants: The speed of light, the Newton gravitational constant, and the Planck constant.\n\n==Derivations==\n===Dimensional analysis===\nThe formula for the Planck mass can be derived by [[dimensional analysis]]. In this approach, one starts with the three [[physical constant]]s ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''G''<ref>this is for the Gaussian version, for the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version, we should use 4{{pi}}''G'' instead of ''G''</ref>, and attempts to combine them to get a quantity whose dimension is mass. The formula sought is of the form\n:<math>m_\\text{P} = c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \\hbar^{n_3},</math>\n\nwhere <math>n_1,n_2,n_3</math> are constants to be determined by equating the dimensions of both sides. Using the symbols <math>\\mathsf{M}</math> for mass, <math>\\mathsf{L}</math> for length and <math>\\mathsf{T}</math> for time, and writing [{{mvar|x}}] to denote the dimension of some physical quantity {{mvar|x}}, we have the following:\n:<math>\\,[c]\\,=\\mathsf{L}\\mathsf{T}^{-1} \\ </math>\n:<math>[G]=\\mathsf{M}^{-1}\\mathsf{L}^3\\mathsf{T}^{-2} </math>\n:<math>\\,[\\hbar]\\,=\\mathsf{M}\\mathsf{L}^2\\mathsf{T}^{-1} \\ </math>.\n\nTherefore,\n:<math>[c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \\hbar^{n_3}] = \\mathsf{M}^{-n_2+n_3} \\mathsf{L}^{n_1+3n_2+2n_3} \\mathsf{T}^{-n_1-2n_2-n_3}.</math>\n\nIf one wants this to equal <math>\\mathsf{M}</math>, the dimension of mass, using <math>\\mathsf{M} = \\mathsf{M}^1\\mathsf{L}^0\\mathsf{T}^0</math>, the following equations need to hold:\n:<math>~~~~~~~~~-n_2 + ~~n_3 = 1 \\ </math>\n:<math>~~~n_1 + 3n_2 + 2n_3 = 0 \\ </math>\n:<math>-n_1 - 2n_2 - ~~n_3 = 0 \\ </math>.\n\nThe solution of this system is:\n:<math>n_1 = 1/2, n_2 = -1/2, n_3 = 1/2. \\ </math>\n\nThus, the Planck mass is:\n:<math>m_\\text{P} = c^{1/2}G^{-1/2}\\hbar^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c\\hbar}{G}}\\ </math>.\n\nDimensional analysis can only determine a formula [[up to]] a [[dimensionless]] multiplicative factor. There is no ''a priori'' reason for starting with the reduced Planck constant ''\u0127'' instead of the original Planck constant ''h'', which differs from it by a factor of 2\u03c0.\n\n===Elimination of a coupling constant===\nEquivalently, the Planck mass is defined such that the [[gravitational potential energy]] between two masses ''m''<sub>P</sub> of separation ''r'' is equal to the energy of a photon (or the mass-energy of a [[graviton]], if such a particle exists) of reduced wavelength ''r'' (see the [[Planck relation]]), or that their ratio equals one.\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{G m_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>\n\nIsolating ''m''<sub>P</sub>, we get that\n:<math>m_\\text{P}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{G}}</math>\n\nNote that if, instead of Planck mass, the electron mass were used, the equation would require a [[gravitational coupling constant]],\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{G m_e^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c \\alpha_G}{r}\\ </math>\n\nanalogous to how the equation of the [[fine-structure constant]] relates the [[elementary charge]] and the [[Planck charge]].\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{k_e q_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{k_e e^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c \\alpha}{r}\\ </math>\n\nIsolating ''q''<sub>P</sub>, we get that\n:<math>q_\\text{P}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{k_e}}</math>\n\nThus, the Planck mass can be viewed as resulting from absorbing the gravitational coupling constant into the unit of mass (and those of distance/time as well), like the Planck charge does for the fine-structure constant. (If the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version (instead of Gaussian version) Planck mass and Planck charge were used, the two equations would require 4{{pi}})\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{4\\pi G m_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{4\\pi k_e q_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n* [[Micro black hole]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (mass)]]\n* [[Planck length]]\n* [[Planck particle]]\n* [[Stoney units]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite arXiv |last=Sivaram |first=C. |eprint=0707.0058v1 |title=What is special about the Planck mass? |class=gr-qc |year=2007}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html |publisher=NIST |title=Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty}}\n\n{{Planck's natural units}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Planck Mass}}\n[[Category:Physical constants]]\n[[Category:Planck units]]\n[[Category:Units of mass]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description |Unit of mass in the system of Planck units}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{expert needed |reason=Unsupported statements, citations needed |date=June 2017}}\n{{textbook |date=May 2018}}\n{{original research |date=April 2018}}\n{{more footnotes |date=December 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox unit\n| symbol   = {{math|<var>m</var><sub>P</sub>}}\n| standard = [[Planck units]]\n| quantity = [[mass]]\n| units1   = [[SI units]]\n| inunits1 = {{physconst|mP|ref=no}}\n| units2   = [[natural units]]\n| inunits2 = {{val|3.30227}} [[Stoney units|{{math|<var>m</var><sub>S</sub>}}]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version)<br>{{val|11.7062}} [[Stoney units|{{math|<var>m</var><sub>S</sub>}}]] (Gaussian version)<br>{{val|8.46971|e=22}} [[Electron rest mass|''m''<sub>e</sub>]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version)<br>{{val|2.38926|e=22}} [[Electron rest mass|''m''<sub>e</sub>]] (Gaussian version)<br>{{val|4.32801|e=28}} [[Natural units#\"Natural units\" (particle physics and cosmology)|eV]] (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version)<br>{{val|1.22091|e=28}} [[Natural units#\"Natural units\" (particle physics and cosmology)|eV]] (Gaussian version)\n| units3   = [[imperial units|imperial]]/[[US customary units|US]]&nbsp;units\n| inunits3 = ??

He suggested that there existed some fundamental natural units for length, mass, time, and energy. He derived these units using only dimensional analysis of what he considered the most fundamental universal constants: The speed of light, the Newton gravitational constant, and the Planck constant.\n\n==Derivations==\n===Dimensional analysis===\nThe formula for the Planck mass can be derived by [[dimensional analysis]]. In this approach, one starts with the three [[physical constant]]s ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''G''<ref>this is for the Gaussian version, for the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version, we should use 4{{pi}}''G'' instead of ''G''</ref>, and attempts to combine them to get a quantity whose dimension is mass. The formula sought is of the form\n:<math>m_\\text{P} = c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \\hbar^{n_3},</math>\n\nwhere <math>n_1,n_2,n_3</math> are constants to be determined by equating the dimensions of both sides. Using the symbols <math>\\mathsf{M}</math> for mass, <math>\\mathsf{L}</math> for length and <math>\\mathsf{T}</math> for time, and writing [{{mvar|x}}] to denote the dimension of some physical quantity {{mvar|x}}, we have the following:\n:<math>\\,[c]\\,=\\mathsf{L}\\mathsf{T}^{-1} \\ </math>\n:<math>[G]=\\mathsf{M}^{-1}\\mathsf{L}^3\\mathsf{T}^{-2} </math>\n:<math>\\,[\\hbar]\\,=\\mathsf{M}\\mathsf{L}^2\\mathsf{T}^{-1} \\ </math>.\n\nTherefore,\n:<math>[c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \\hbar^{n_3}] = \\mathsf{M}^{-n_2+n_3} \\mathsf{L}^{n_1+3n_2+2n_3} \\mathsf{T}^{-n_1-2n_2-n_3}.</math>\n\nIf one wants this to equal <math>\\mathsf{M}</math>, the dimension of mass, using <math>\\mathsf{M} = \\mathsf{M}^1\\mathsf{L}^0\\mathsf{T}^0</math>, the following equations need to hold:\n:<math>~~~~~~~~~-n_2 + ~~n_3 = 1 \\ </math>\n:<math>~~~n_1 + 3n_2 + 2n_3 = 0 \\ </math>\n:<math>-n_1 - 2n_2 - ~~n_3 = 0 \\ </math>.\n\nThe solution of this system is:\n:<math>n_1 = 1/2, n_2 = -1/2, n_3 = 1/2. \\ </math>\n\nThus, the Planck mass is:\n:<math>m_\\text{P} = c^{1/2}G^{-1/2}\\hbar^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c\\hbar}{G}}\\ </math>.\n\nDimensional analysis can only determine a formula [[up to]] a [[dimensionless]] multiplicative factor. There is no ''a priori'' reason for starting with the reduced Planck constant ''\u0127'' instead of the original Planck constant ''h'', which differs from it by a factor of 2\u03c0.\n\n===Elimination of a coupling constant===\nEquivalently, the Planck mass is defined such that the [[gravitational potential energy]] between two masses ''m''<sub>P</sub> of separation ''r'' is equal to the energy of a photon (or the mass-energy of a [[graviton]], if such a particle exists) of reduced wavelength ''r'' (see the [[Planck relation]]), or that their ratio equals one.\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{G m_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>.\n\nIsolating ''m''<sub>P</sub>, we get that\n:<math>m_\\text{P}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{G}}</math>\n\nNote that if, instead of Planck mass, the electron mass were used, the equation would require a [[gravitational coupling constant]],\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{G m_e^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c \\alpha_G}{r}\\ </math>.\n\nanalogous to how the equation of the [[fine-structure constant]] relates the [[elementary charge]] and the [[Planck charge]].\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{k_e q_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>.\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{k_e e^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c \\alpha}{r}\\ </math>.\n\nIsolating ''q''<sub>P</sub>, we get that\n:<math>q_\\text{P}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{k_e}}</math>\n\nThus, the Planck mass can be viewed as resulting from absorbing the gravitational coupling constant into the unit of mass (and those of distance/time as well), like the Planck charge does for the fine-structure constant. (If the Lorentz\u2013Heaviside version (instead of Gaussian version) Planck mass and Planck charge were used, the two equations would require 4{{pi}})\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{4\\pi G m_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>.\n\n:<math>E=\\frac{4\\pi k_e q_\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\frac{\\hbar c}{r}\\ </math>.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n* [[Micro black hole]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (mass)]]\n* [[Planck length]]\n* [[Planck particle]]\n* [[Stoney units]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite arXiv |last=Sivaram |first=C. |eprint=0707.0058v1 |title=What is special about the Planck mass? |class=gr-qc |year=2007}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html |publisher=NIST |title=Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty}}\n\n{{Planck's natural units}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Planck Mass}}\n[[Category:Physical constants]]\n[[Category:Planck units]]\n[[Category:Units of mass]]\n", "name_user": "Ahri6279", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eElimination of a coupling constant", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_mass"}

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.

This organization also hosts various foreign dignitaries, US Government officials, and subject matter experts to further inform and foster international understanding both in the university's student body and the greater D.C. community.\n\nThere are also several a cappella performance groups on campus. The university's school-sponsored a cappella group, the co-ed GW Troubadours, has been a presence on campus since the mid-1950s and regularly records studio albums and travels internationally with the Department of Music. The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Each year, the groups duke it out at the Battle of the A-Cappella groups, one of the biggest student events on GW's campus.\n\nAnother student group, the Emergency Medical Response Group (EMeRG) provides an all-volunteer 24/7 ambulance service for the campus and the Foggy Bottom/West End community at no cost. EMeRG has been active on campus since 1994 and has advanced from bike response into a two ambulance system that is sanctioned by the District of Columbia Department of Health and DC Fire and EMS (DCFEMS). EMeRG also plays an active role in special events in around the DC area including the Marine Corps Marathon, National Marathon, Cherry Blossom Race, Commencement, Inauguration and other events in downtown D.C. and on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite web|last=GWU|first=EMeRG|title=Emergency Medical Response Group|url=http://gwemerg.com/|publisher=GWU EMeRG|accessdate=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501114330/http://gwemerg.com/|archive-date=May 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:10px;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of Greek Chapters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Inter-fraternity Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |title=Interfraternity Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606200621/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/interfraternity-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Panhellenic Association<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |title=Panhellenic Association |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606204432/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/panhellenic-association |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Multicultural Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |title=Multicultural Greek Council |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606194623/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/multicultural-greek-council |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Alternative Greek Council<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |title=Alternative Greek Organizations |publisher=George Washington University Alternative Greek Council |access-date=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522155504/http://gwuagc.weebly.com/alternative-greek-organizations.html |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Beta Theta Pi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Phi]]<br />[[Delta Tau Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Order]]<br />[[Kappa Sigma]]<br />[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Delta Theta]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Kappa]]<br />[[Pi Kappa Alpha]]<br />[[Sigma Chi]]<br />[[Sigma Nu]]<br />[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]<br />[[Zeta Beta Tau]]||[[Alpha Delta Pi]]<br />[[Alpha Phi]]<br />[[Chi Omega]]\n[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]<br />[[Kappa Alpha Theta]]<br />[[Kappa Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Beta Phi]]<br />[[Sigma Delta Tau]]<br />[[Sigma Kappa]]\n\n| [[Alpha Phi Alpha]]<br />[[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]\n[[Delta Lambda Phi]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Theta]]<br />[[Iota Nu Delta]]<br />[[Kappa Phi Lambda]]<br />[[Lambda Pi Chi]]<br />[[Phi Beta Sigma]]<br />[[Pi Delta Psi]]<br />[[Sigma Lambda Upsilon]]<br />[[Sigma Psi Zeta]]<br />[[Zeta Phi Beta]]\n|[[Alpha Kappa Psi]]<br />[[Alpha Chi Sigma]]<br />[[Alpha Omega Epsilon]]<br />[[Alpha Phi Omega]]<br />[[Delta Epsilon Mu]]<br />[[Delta Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]]<br />[[Phi Alpha Delta]]<br />[[Phi Beta Kappa]]<br />[[Phi Sigma Pi]]<br />[[Sigma Iota Rho]]<br />[[Tau Beta Pi]]<br />[[Theta Tau]]\n|}\n[[File:Townhouse Row GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Townhouse Row, home of many fraternities and sororities.]]\nGW has a large Greek community with over 3,000 students consisting of just under 27 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=\"Greek community\">{{cite web |url=https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |title=Greek Life Office |publisher=The George Washington University |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606190055/https://greeklife.gwu.edu/ |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Greek organizations are divided up between and governed by the Inter-Fraternity Council with 14 chapters, the Panhellenic Association with 11 chapters, and the Multicultural Greek Council with 13 chapters.<ref name=\"Greek community\"/> Other Greek-life, known as \"Alternative Greek Life\" or simply \"Alt-Greek\", exists on campus in the form of professional, community-serviced based and honor groups although not under the university's traditional Greek life governing structure but instead are considered separate student organizations\n\n===Scholarly societies===\n[[File:Old Main Career Center GWU.JPG|thumb|left|Rice Hall, 1922 F Street, houses various administrative offices.]]\n\nThere are chapters of many varied academic groups at the university.
