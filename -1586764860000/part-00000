And a country like that does not deserve to exist.\u201d The remarks sparked outrage from Jewish groups after a clip of the show was posted on YouTube by HonestReporting Canada, a website that monitors the media for anti-Israel bias. The California-based Simon Wiesenthal Center has since launched a protest against the network demanding Mr. Gendron\u2019s show be cancelled. In response, Gendron stated that he was not promoting hate speech against Jews or Israel, but rather taking issue with the country\u2019s politics, writing in an email that \u201cI am defending a state with both Palestine and Israel living together, I may be naive, but this is my position.

This chapter is directly related to a fight led by a former Member of the National Assembly for Huntingdon.

During the [[2007 Quebec general election]], he supported the [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec]] party.  In April 2008, Gendron called for [[Mario Dumont]]'s resignation, claiming that he is especially disappointed with the way the ADQ leader has handled the immigration issue since becoming [[List of

It was later discovered that the authors of the crime spree were, in fact, both adults.\n\n===Jean Charest===\nIn 2005, he claimed that [[Quebec premier]] [[Jean Charest]] was a \"murderer\" (\"meurtrier\") for his government's initial refusal to subsidize [[Herceptin]], a new drug against [[breast cancer]];<ref name=\"cyberpresse.ca\"/> he later apologized for these comments after being served legal papers.<ref>[http://www.radioreveil.com/index.php?sectionrr=4&newstopic_id=4096  Radio R\u00e9veil, Le site de la radio au Qu\u00e9bec] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927005318/http://www.radioreveil.com/index.php?sectionrr=4&newstopic_id=4096 |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Israel/Nazi analogy===\nGendron has courted controversy for his statements about the state of Israel.

And a country like that does not deserve to exist.\u201d The remarks sparked outrage from Jewish groups after a clip of the show was posted on YouTube by HonestReporting Canada, a website that monitors the media for anti-Israel bias. The California-based Simon Wiesenthal Center has since launched a protest against the network demanding Mr. Gendron\u2019s show be cancelled. In response, Gendron stated that he was not promoting hate speech against Jews or Israel, but rather taking issue with the country\u2019s politics, writing in an email that \u201cI am defending a state with both Palestine and Israel living together, I may be naive, but this is my position.

It is the same with the soul of a man who has died a violent death; it remains near the body\u2014nothing can make it go away; it is retained there by sympathy; several have been seen sighing near their bodies which were interred. The magicians abuse their power over such in their incantations; they force them to obey, when they are masters of the dead body, or even part of it. Frequent experience taught them that there is a secret virtue in the body, which draws towards it the spirit which has once inhabited it; wherefore those who wish to receive or become the receptacles of the spirits of such animals as know the future, eat the principle parts of them, as the hearts of crows, moles, or hawks. The spirit of these creatures enters into them at the moment they eat this food, and makes them give out oracles like divinities.''.<ref>Calmet (1751), pp. 237\u2013238</ref> ''Porphyry, when consulted by Anebo, an Egyptian priest, if those who foretell the future and perform prodigies have more powerful souls, or whether they receive power from some strange spirit, replies that, according to appearance, all these things are done by means of certain evil spirits that are naturally knavish, and take all sorts of shapes, and do everything that one sees happen, whether good or evil; but that in the end they never lead men to what is truly good.''<ref>Calmet (1751), p. 266</ref> \u2013 [[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]] </blockquote>\n\n== Ancient Greeks ==\n{{See|Nympholepsy}}\n\n==African traditions==\n===Central Africa===\n\n====Democratic Republic of the Congo====\n{{See also|Zebola}}\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n\n====Ethiopia====\n{{See also|Z\u0101r}}\n\n=====Gurage people=====\nAmong the [[Gurage people]] of Ethiopia, spirit possession is a common belief. Wiliam A. Shack postulated that it is caused by Gurage cultural attitudes about food and hunger, while they have a plentiful food supply, cultural pressures that force the Gurage to either share it to meet social obligations, or hoard it and eat it secretly cause feelings of anxiety. Distinctions are drawn between spirits that strictly possess men, spirits that possess women, and spirits that possess victims of either sex. A ritual illness that only affects men is believed to be caused by a spirit called ''awre''. This affliction presents itself by loss of appetite, nausea, and attacks from severe stomach pains. If it persists the victim may enter a trancelike stupor, in which he sometimes regains consciousness long enough to take food and water. Breathing is often labored. Seizures and trembling overcome the patient, and in extreme cases, partial paralysis of the extremities.<ref name=\"Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43\">Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. Shack Source: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30\u201343</ref>\n\nIf the victim does not recover naturally, a traditional healer, or ''sagwara'', is summoned. Once the sagwara has determined the spirit's name through the use of divination, he prescribes a routine formula to exorcise the spirit. This is not a permanent cure, however, it is believed to allow the victim to form a relationship with the spirit. Nevertheless, the victim is subject to chronic repossession, which is treated by repeating the formula. This formula involves the preparation and consumption of a dish of [[ensete]], butter, and red pepper. During this ritual, the victim's head is covered with a drape, and he eats the ensete ravenously while other ritual participants participate by chanting. The ritual ends when the possessing spirit announces that it is satisfied. Shack notes that the victims are overwhelmingly poor men, and that women are not as food-deprived as men are due to ritual activities that involve food redistribution and consumption. Shack postulates that the ''awre'' serves to bring the possessed man to the center of social attention, and to relieve his anxieties over his inability to gain prestige from redistributing food, which is the primary way in which Gurage men gain status in their society.<ref name=\"Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43\"/>\n\n=====Sidama people=====\nThe belief in spirit possession is part of their native culture of the [[Sidama people]] of southwest [[Ethiopia]]. Anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that it is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society, although they do not draw from I.M. Lewis (see Cultural anthropology section under Scientific views). The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.<ref>Hamer, John and Irene Hamer 1966 Spirit Possession and Its Socio-Psychological Implications among the Sidamo of Southwest Ethiopia.

These ''shaitani'' typically demand luxury items to make the patient well again. Despite the fact that men sometimes accuse women of faking the possessions in order to get luxury items, attention, and sympathy, they do generally regard spirit possession as a genuine condition and view victims of it as being ill through no fault of their own. However, men sometimes suspect women of actively colluding with spirits in order to be possessed.<ref>Gomm, Roger 1975 Bargaining from Weakness: Spirit Possession on the South Kenya Coast Man, New Series: 10 (4):530\u2013543</ref>\n\n=====Giriama people=====\nThe [[Giriama people]] of coastal Kenya believe in spirit possession.<ref>Reluctant Muslims: Embodied Hegemony and Moral Resistance in a Giriama Spirit Possession Janet McIntosh The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 91\u2013112</ref>\n\n====Mayotte====\nIn [[Mayotte]], approximately 25 percent of the adult population, and five times as many women as men, enter trance states in which they are supposedly possessed by certain identifiable spirits who maintain stable and coherent identities from one possession to the next.<ref>Lambek, Michael 1988 Spirit Possession/Spirit Succession: Aspects of Social Continuity among Malagasy Speakers in Mayotte.

When the ''loa'' descends upon a practitioner, the practitioner's body is being used by the spirit, according to the tradition. Some spirits are believed to be able to give prophecies of upcoming events or situations pertaining to the possessed one, also called ''Chwal'' or the \"Horse of the Spirit.\" Practitioners describe this as a beautiful but very tiring experience. Most people who are possessed by the spirit describe the onset as a feeling of blackness or energy flowing through their body as if they were being electrocuted. According to Vodou believers, when this occurs, it is a sign that a possession is about to take place.\n\nAccording to tradition, the practitioner has no recollection of the possession and in fact when the possessing spirit leaves the body, the possessed one is tired and wonders what has happened during the possession. It is also believed that there are those who feign possessions because they want attention or a feeling of importance, because those who are possessed carry a high importance in ceremony. Often, a ''chwal'' will undergo some form of trial or testing to make sure that the possession is allegedly genuine. As an example, someone possessed by one of the [[Gu\u00e9d\u00e9]] spirits may be offered ''piment'', a [[liqueur]] made by steeping twenty-one [[chili pepper]]s in ''kleren'', a potent [[alcoholic beverage]]. If the chwal consumes the piment without showing any evidence of pain or discomfort, the possession is regarded as genuine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Umbanda===\nThe concept of spirit possession is also found in [[Umbanda]], an Afro-Brazilian folk religion.

Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists.

It is the same with the soul of a man who has died a violent death; it remains near the body\u2014nothing can make it go away; it is retained there by sympathy; several have been seen sighing near their bodies which were interred. The magicians abuse their power over such in their incantations; they force them to obey, when they are masters of the dead body, or even part of it. Frequent experience taught them that there is a secret virtue in the body, which draws towards it the spirit which has once inhabited it; wherefore those who wish to receive or become the receptacles of the spirits of such animals as know the future, eat the principle parts of them, as the hearts of crows, moles, or hawks. The spirit of these creatures enters into them at the moment they eat this food, and makes them give out oracles like divinities.''.<ref>Calmet (1751), pp. 237\u2013238</ref> ''Porphyry, when consulted by Anebo, an Egyptian priest, if those who foretell the future and perform prodigies have more powerful souls, or whether they receive power from some strange spirit, replies that, according to appearance, all these things are done by means of certain evil spirits that are naturally knavish, and take all sorts of shapes, and do everything that one sees happen, whether good or evil; but that in the end they never lead men to what is truly good.''<ref>Calmet (1751), p. 266</ref> \u2013 [[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]] </blockquote>\n\n== Ancient Greeks ==\n{{See|Nympholepsy}}\n\n==African traditions==\n===Central Africa===\n\n====Democratic Republic of the Congo====\n{{See also|Zebola}}\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n\n====Ethiopia====\n{{See also|Z\u0101r}}\n\n=====Gurage people=====\nAmong the [[Gurage people]] of Ethiopia, spirit possession is a common belief. Wiliam A. Shack postulated that it is caused by Gurage cultural attitudes about food and hunger, while they have a plentiful food supply, cultural pressures that force the Gurage to either share it to meet social obligations, or hoard it and eat it secretly cause feelings of anxiety. Distinctions are drawn between spirits that strictly possess men, spirits that possess women, and spirits that possess victims of either sex. A ritual illness that only affects men is believed to be caused by a spirit called ''awre''. This affliction presents itself by loss of appetite, nausea, and attacks from severe stomach pains. If it persists the victim may enter a trancelike stupor, in which he sometimes regains consciousness long enough to take food and water. Breathing is often labored. Seizures and trembling overcome the patient, and in extreme cases, partial paralysis of the extremities.<ref name=\"Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43\">Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. Shack Source: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30\u201343</ref>\n\nIf the victim does not recover naturally, a traditional healer, or ''sagwara'', is summoned. Once the sagwara has determined the spirit's name through the use of divination, he prescribes a routine formula to exorcise the spirit. This is not a permanent cure, however, it is believed to allow the victim to form a relationship with the spirit. Nevertheless, the victim is subject to chronic repossession, which is treated by repeating the formula. This formula involves the preparation and consumption of a dish of [[ensete]], butter, and red pepper. During this ritual, the victim's head is covered with a drape, and he eats the ensete ravenously while other ritual participants participate by chanting. The ritual ends when the possessing spirit announces that it is satisfied. Shack notes that the victims are overwhelmingly poor men, and that women are not as food-deprived as men are due to ritual activities that involve food redistribution and consumption. Shack postulates that the ''awre'' serves to bring the possessed man to the center of social attention, and to relieve his anxieties over his inability to gain prestige from redistributing food, which is the primary way in which Gurage men gain status in their society.<ref name=\"Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43\"/>\n\n=====Sidama people=====\nThe belief in spirit possession is part of their native culture of the [[Sidama people]] of southwest [[Ethiopia]]. Anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that it is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society, although they do not draw from I.M. Lewis (see Cultural anthropology section under Scientific views). The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.<ref>Hamer, John and Irene Hamer 1966 Spirit Possession and Its Socio-Psychological Implications among the Sidamo of Southwest Ethiopia.

These ''shaitani'' typically demand luxury items to make the patient well again. Despite the fact that men sometimes accuse women of faking the possessions in order to get luxury items, attention, and sympathy, they do generally regard spirit possession as a genuine condition and view victims of it as being ill through no fault of their own. However, men sometimes suspect women of actively colluding with spirits in order to be possessed.<ref>Gomm, Roger 1975 Bargaining from Weakness: Spirit Possession on the South Kenya Coast Man, New Series: 10 (4):530\u2013543</ref>\n\n=====Giriama people=====\nThe [[Giriama people]] of coastal Kenya believe in spirit possession.<ref>Reluctant Muslims: Embodied Hegemony and Moral Resistance in a Giriama Spirit Possession Janet McIntosh The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 91\u2013112</ref>\n\n====Mayotte====\nIn [[Mayotte]], approximately 25 percent of the adult population, and five times as many women as men, enter trance states in which they are supposedly possessed by certain identifiable spirits who maintain stable and coherent identities from one possession to the next.<ref>Lambek, Michael 1988 Spirit Possession/Spirit Succession: Aspects of Social Continuity among Malagasy Speakers in Mayotte. American Ethnologist: 15 (4): 710\u2013731</ref>\n\n====Mozambique====\nIn [[Mozambique]], a new belief in spirit possession appeared after the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. These spirits, called ''gamba'', are said to be identified as dead soldiers, and allegedly overwhelmingly possess women. Prior to the war, spirit possession was limited to certain families and was less common.<ref>Igreja, Victor, Beatrice Dias-Lambranca, and Annemiek Richters 2008.

The majority of the supposedly possessed are married women. The condition of spirit possession among them is called ''inwatso''. Those who develop the condition of ''inwatso'' are regarded as having a special calling to divine the future. They are first treated with sympathy, and then with respect as they allegedly develop their abilities to foretell the future.<ref>O'Connell, M.C. 1982 Spirit Possession and Role Stress among the Xesibe of Eastern Transkei Ethnology, 21 (1):  21\u201337.</ref>\n\n====Tanzania====\nThe [[Sukuma people]] of [[Tanzania]] believe in spirit possession.<ref>Hysteria in Sukuma Medical PracticeR.

When the ''loa'' descends upon a practitioner, the practitioner's body is being used by the spirit, according to the tradition. Some spirits are believed to be able to give prophecies of upcoming events or situations pertaining to the possessed one, also called ''Chwal'' or the \"Horse of the Spirit.\" Practitioners describe this as a beautiful but very tiring experience. Most people who are possessed by the spirit describe the onset as a feeling of blackness or energy flowing through their body as if they were being electrocuted. According to Vodou believers, when this occurs, it is a sign that a possession is about to take place.\n\nAccording to tradition, the practitioner has no recollection of the possession and in fact when the possessing spirit leaves the body, the possessed one is tired and wonders what has happened during the possession. It is also believed that there are those who feign possessions because they want attention or a feeling of importance, because those who are possessed carry a high importance in ceremony. Often, a ''chwal'' will undergo some form of trial or testing to make sure that the possession is allegedly genuine. As an example, someone possessed by one of the [[Gu\u00e9d\u00e9]] spirits may be offered ''piment'', a [[liqueur]] made by steeping twenty-one [[chili pepper]]s in ''kleren'', a potent [[alcoholic beverage]]. If the chwal consumes the piment without showing any evidence of pain or discomfort, the possession is regarded as genuine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Umbanda===\nThe concept of spirit possession is also found in [[Umbanda]], an Afro-Brazilian folk religion. According to tradition, one such possessing spirit is [[Pomba Gira]], who possesses both women and effeminate males.<ref>Hayes, Kelly E. 2008.

But apart from these \"nightmare shapes,\" it is believed the impersonation or incarnation of animals could in some circumstances also be highly beneficial, according to Michel Strickmann.<ref name=\"Strickmann 2002, p. 251\">Michel Strickmann (2002), ''Chinese Magical Medicine'', edited by Bernard Faure, Stanford University Press, p. 251.</ref>\n\nCh'i Chung-fu, a Chinese gynecologist writing early in the thirteenth century, wrote that in addition to five sorts of falling frenzy classified according to their causative factors, there were also four types of other frenzies distinguished by the sounds and movements given off by the victim during his seizure: cow, horse, pig, and dog frenzies.<ref name=\"Strickmann 2002, p. 251\"/>\n\n===East Asian religions===\n{{See also|East Asian religions}}\nCertain sects of [[Taoism]], [[Korean shamanism]], [[Shinto]], some Japanese new religious movements, and other East Asian religions feature the idea of spirit possession.

Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The supposedly possessed individual is referred to as a ''ghorala'', or \"mount\".

Roughly similar to voluntary possession in Vaudon (Voodoo), ''sanghyang'' is considered a sacred state in which [[hyang]]s (deities) or helpful spirits temporarily inhabit the bodies of participants. The purpose of sanghyang is believed to be to cleanse people and places of evil influences and restore spiritual balance. Thus, it is often referred to as an exorcism ceremony.\n\n====Sulawesi====\nThe women of the [[Bonerate people]] of [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia practice a possession-trance ritual in which they smother glowing embers with their bare feet at the climax.

It was the fourth of eight expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\n== Organization == \nThe Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Storming of the Bastille]], which marked the beginning of [[French Revolution]], and was also seen a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. <ref>''L'Exposition de 1889 et la tour Eiffel, d'apr\u00e8s les documents officiels. 1889''. pp. 165-166</ref>  The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== Admission price ==\nAdmission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of a \"economy\" plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes.  Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions.  Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}  The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 Francs, while income was 49,500,000 Francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== National Participation and boycotts ==\nThe countries which officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Moroco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia,  Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay, The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition.  The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte, ''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', ''Le Mouvement social'' number 149, 1989, pg. 15 (in French)</ref>\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from these countries did participate, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. These included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil. China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Britain and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte,''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', (in French), ''Le Mouvement Social'', number 149, 1989, page 15</ref>\n\n== Exposition Sites ==\n[[File:Plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Exposition Universelle de 1889.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of the 1889 Exposition]].\n\nThe Exposition occupied two large sites.  The main site was on [[Champs de Mars]] on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the [[Ecole Militaire]], and had been occupied by the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].  This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro|Trocadero Palace]], which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition.  The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. \n\nA separate, smaller site was located esplanade of [[Les Invalides]], which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a  large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes, with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. This was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.  This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], architect of the [[Paris Opera]].\n\nThere were twenty-two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter.  They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants.  The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.<ref>Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay catalog (11989) pg. 105 </ref>\n\n== Views of the Exposition ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537199 (3784839428).jpg|The main entrance of the Exposition \nFile:CLC 528 - PARIS - Galerie des Machines.JPG|Postcard of trams stopping at the [[Galerie des Machines]], at the edge of the Exposition\nFile:Tour Eiffel 3b40739.jpg|Exposition seen from a balloon (1889) \nFile:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Paris Exposition, view from ground level of the Eiffel tower with Parisians promenading, 1889.jpg|View under the Eiffel Tower toward the Central Dome\nFile:La Tour Eiffel from North of the Trocadero, 1889 - Flickr 14382709664.jpg|View of Exposition from Trocadero\nFile:Street view, looking toward Palais des Invalides, showing pavilions on L'Esplanade des Invalides, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilions on the Esplanade des Invalides, with [[Les Invalides]] in the background\nFile:Exposition Universal 1889 Paris France.jpg|View of the Central Dome\n</gallery>\n\n== Structures ==\n=== The Eiffel Tower ===\nThe [[Eiffel Tower]], built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called  \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It  was won by the construction firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]], which had recently built the iron frame of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884,  had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.  The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.  Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms.  A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in [[Levallois-Perret]], a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared,  \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"  During the Exposition, No one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform,  though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DE1030E633A2575AC1A9639C94689FD7CF|title=The Great French Show|date=1889-05-19|work=The New York Times|pages=Front Page|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}} \n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer [[Edouard Branly]], be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|The tower under construction a year before the opening  (1888)\nFile:Les escaliers de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus de la deuxi\u00e8me plate-forme, 1889.jpg|Stairway to the viewing level\nFile:Gustave Eiffel posant au sommet de la tour.jpg|[[Gustave Eiffel]] (left) posing on the stairway of his tower\nFile:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|The Otis elevators that carried visitors up the north and south legs of the tower\nFile:View of Exposition Universelle from Eiffel Tower, Paris, 1889.jpg|View of the Seine and the Exposition from the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|Chromolithograph by George Garen of the Eiffel Tower illuminations (1889)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Gallery of Machines ===\nA second monumental building on the site was the [[Galerie des machines]], by the architect [[Ferdinand Dutert]] and engineer [[Victor Contamin]], which had originally been built for the [[Universal Exposition of 1878]]. It was a huge iron and glass structure  which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land  between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 meters of glass windows.  At 111 meters, the Galerie covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=81}}   It was later used again at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]] and then destroyed in 1910.  \n\nThe Galerie of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in the History of Civil Engineering|author= Stamper, John W.|volume=10|editor=  |year=2000|quote=The principal material of the building\u2019s structure was to have been steel, but the decision was made at the last minute to use iron instead. William Watson, an American engineer who wrote a thorough report on the fair after it closed states that the idea of using steel was abandoned \"on the two-fold ground of expense and the necessity of hastening the execution of work. \" The price of iron was about two-thirds that of steel in 1889.}}</ref><ref> There is an extensive description, with illustrations, of the Exposition's two famous buildings in the British journal ''Engineering'' (3 May 1889 issue). A follow-up report appears a late issue with this summation:</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Engineering|date=14 June 1889|title=The File:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpgParis Exhibition|page=677 }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Interior of exhibition building, Exposition Universal, Paris, France.jpg|Interior of the Galerie des machines (1889) \nFile:Central Dome of the Gallery des Machines Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 by Louis Beroud 1852 1930.jpg|Interior of the central dome of the Gallerie des machines, by [[Louis B\u00e9roud]] (1889)\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Science and technology===\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. \n\nAnother new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, [[Otis Elevator]]. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.  The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.\n\nThere were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.  \n\nPrefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition.  Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel,  and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina.   Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers,  can now be found in the Forest of [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines|Dampierre]]. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=98-99}} \n\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Le phonographe Edison, \u00e0 la section des \u00c9tats-Unis.jpg|Edison [[phonograph]] demonstrated at the Exposition \nFile:La Tour Eiffel.

Both were designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]] with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. \n\nThe Exposition  included a building by the Paris architect [[Pierre-Henri Picq]].  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort de France]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Les charpentes des Palais des beaux-arts et des arts lib\u00e9raux au Champ-de-Mars.jpg|The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts under construction, both designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Gezicht in tentoonstellingszaal van de Wereldtentoonstelling van 1889 in Parijs Exposition Universelle de 1889 (titel op object), RP-F-F16653.jpg|Interior of the Palace of Fine Arts by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France-LCCN2001698574.jpg|The Palace of Fine Arts\nFile:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpg|Inerior of the Palace of Liberal Arts\nFile:Interior of Paris Exposition building showing two balloons LCCN2002717992.tif|Interior of the Palace of Liberal Arts, with balloons\n</gallery>\n\n===Fountains===\nThe Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled \"The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.\"  The fountain was designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]], who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The other major fountain, not far away, was \"The Five Parts of the World\", illustrating the continents.  It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fountain Coutan and the Central Dome, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|The Coutan Fountain and central dome \n</gallery>\n\n=== The \"Street of Cairo\" and exotic habitations===\nThe Rue de Caire (\"Street of Cairo\") was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of [[Cairo]].  It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it.  It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl\u00e9on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the [[Suez Canal]].  It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings,  a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo.  The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.\n\nThe Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:La rue du Caire.

The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. \n\nThe Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect [[Albert Ballu]], who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments.  After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to [[Buenos Aires]], where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}} \n\n\nIn addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electrify pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. \nThe Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products.  One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from [[Champagne Mercier]] that could hold two thousand bottles of  champagne, {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}}\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|The Pavilion of Argentina, winner of the contest for best national pavilion\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n chileno en la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds de 1889-cropped.jpg|Pavilion of Chile\nFile:Pavilion of Brazil, Paris Exposition, 1889 LCCN92520980.jpg|Pavilion of Brazil \nFile:Paris Exposition train 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Algeria, with the Exposition train \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537046 (3784010239).jpg|Pavilion of Persia \nFile:Pavilion of India, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of India \nFile:Pavilion of Siam, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Siam \nFile:Palais du Mexican, Paris Exposition, 1889 (14382646444).jpg|Pavilion of Mexico\nFile:Pavilion of Nicaragua and base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Nicaragua\nFile:\u00a8Pavillon des \u00eeles Hawa\u00ef - Exposition universelle Paris 1889.jpg|Paviiion of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] \nFile:Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, in Egyptian style\nFile:Le palais des produits alimentaires, Exposition universelle 1889.jpg|The Palace of Food Products\nFile:Epernay fass mercier side view.jpg|A gigantic oak barrel with a capacity of 200 000 bottles of champagne was a feature of the [[Champagne Mercier]] exhibit at the food and wine pavilion. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Charles Garnier's ''History of Habitation'' ===\nAn unusual display was the \"History of Habitation\" designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] named for him. He was then sixty-one, and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera.  He had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, denouncing the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity. Despite this, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation.  These houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n\nThe houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas.  These dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historic accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular.  The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 \"Casa egipcia\" (3784820432).jpg|The Egyptian House of the History of Habitation, by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537073 (3784014313).jpg|The Aztec House and Incan House by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537049 (3784820368).jpg|The Roman House and the Gallo-Roman House, by Charles Garnier\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMany smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition.  The architect [[Hector Guimard]], then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren.  The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.\n\n{{quote|the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features.  In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now-a-days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.}}\n\n==Science and technology==\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology.

It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== National Participation and boycotts ==\nThe countries which officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Moroco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia,  Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay, The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition.  The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte, ''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', ''Le Mouvement social'' number 149, 1989, pg. 15 (in French)</ref>\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from these countries did participate, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors.

The main site was on [[Champs de Mars]] on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the [[Ecole Militaire]], and had been occupied by the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].  This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro|Trocadero Palace]], which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition.  The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. \n\nA separate, smaller site was located esplanade of [[Les Invalides]], which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a  large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes, with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. This was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.  This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], architect of the [[Paris Opera]].\n\nThere were twenty-two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter.  They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants.  The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.<ref>Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay catalog (11989) pg. 105 </ref>\n\n== Views of the Exposition ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537199 (3784839428).jpg|The main entrance of the Exposition \nFile:CLC 528 - PARIS - Galerie des Machines.JPG|Postcard of trams stopping at the [[Galerie des Machines]], at the edge of the Exposition\nFile:Tour Eiffel 3b40739.jpg|Exposition seen from a balloon (1889) \nFile:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Paris Exposition, view from ground level of the Eiffel tower with Parisians promenading, 1889.jpg|View under the Eiffel Tower toward the Central Dome\nFile:La Tour Eiffel from North of the Trocadero, 1889 - Flickr 14382709664.jpg|View of Exposition from Trocadero\nFile:Street view, looking toward Palais des Invalides, showing pavilions on L'Esplanade des Invalides, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilions on the Esplanade des Invalides, with [[Les Invalides]] in the background\nFile:Exposition Universal 1889 Paris France.jpg|View of the Central Dome\n</gallery>\n\n== Structures ==\n=== The Eiffel Tower ===\nThe [[Eiffel Tower]], built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called  \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It  was won by the construction firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]], which had recently built the iron frame of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884,  had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.  The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.  Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms.  A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in [[Levallois-Perret]], a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared,  \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"  During the Exposition, No one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform,  though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DE1030E633A2575AC1A9639C94689FD7CF|title=The Great French Show|date=1889-05-19|work=The New York Times|pages=Front Page|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}} \n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer [[Edouard Branly]], be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|The tower under construction a year before the opening  (1888)\nFile:Les escaliers de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus de la deuxi\u00e8me plate-forme, 1889.jpg|Stairway to the viewing level\nFile:Gustave Eiffel posant au sommet de la tour.jpg|[[Gustave Eiffel]] (left) posing on the stairway of his tower\nFile:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|The Otis elevators that carried visitors up the north and south legs of the tower\nFile:View of Exposition Universelle from Eiffel Tower, Paris, 1889.jpg|View of the Seine and the Exposition from the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|Chromolithograph by George Garen of the Eiffel Tower illuminations (1889)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Gallery of Machines ===\nA second monumental building on the site was the [[Galerie des machines]], by the architect [[Ferdinand Dutert]] and engineer [[Victor Contamin]], which had originally been built for the [[Universal Exposition of 1878]]. It was a huge iron and glass structure  which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land  between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 meters of glass windows.  At 111 meters, the Galerie covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=81}}   It was later used again at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]] and then destroyed in 1910.  \n\nThe Galerie of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in the History of Civil Engineering|author= Stamper, John W.|volume=10|editor=  |year=2000|quote=The principal material of the building\u2019s structure was to have been steel, but the decision was made at the last minute to use iron instead. William Watson, an American engineer who wrote a thorough report on the fair after it closed states that the idea of using steel was abandoned \"on the two-fold ground of expense and the necessity of hastening the execution of work. \" The price of iron was about two-thirds that of steel in 1889.}}</ref><ref> There is an extensive description, with illustrations, of the Exposition's two famous buildings in the British journal ''Engineering'' (3 May 1889 issue). A follow-up report appears a late issue with this summation:</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Engineering|date=14 June 1889|title=The File:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpgParis Exhibition|page=677 }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Interior of exhibition building, Exposition Universal, Paris, France.jpg|Interior of the Galerie des machines (1889) \nFile:Central Dome of the Gallery des Machines Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 by Louis Beroud 1852 1930.jpg|Interior of the central dome of the Gallerie des machines, by [[Louis B\u00e9roud]] (1889)\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Science and technology===\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. \n\nAnother new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, [[Otis Elevator]]. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.  The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.\n\nThere were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.  \n\nPrefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition.  Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel,  and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina.   Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers,  can now be found in the Forest of [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines|Dampierre]]. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=98-99}} \n\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Le phonographe Edison, \u00e0 la section des \u00c9tats-Unis.jpg|Edison [[phonograph]] demonstrated at the Exposition \nFile:La Tour Eiffel.

Both were designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]] with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. \n\nThe Exposition  included a building by the Paris architect [[Pierre-Henri Picq]].  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort de France]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Les charpentes des Palais des beaux-arts et des arts lib\u00e9raux au Champ-de-Mars.jpg|The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts under construction, both designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Gezicht in tentoonstellingszaal van de Wereldtentoonstelling van 1889 in Parijs Exposition Universelle de 1889 (titel op object), RP-F-F16653.jpg|Interior of the Palace of Fine Arts by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France-LCCN2001698574.jpg|The Palace of Fine Arts\nFile:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpg|Inerior of the Palace of Liberal Arts\nFile:Interior of Paris Exposition building showing two balloons LCCN2002717992.tif|Interior of the Palace of Liberal Arts, with balloons\n</gallery>\n\n===Fountains===\nThe Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled \"The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.\"  The fountain was designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]], who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The other major fountain, not far away, was \"The Five Parts of the World\", illustrating the continents.  It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fountain Coutan and the Central Dome, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|The Coutan Fountain and central dome \n</gallery>\n\n=== The \"Street of Cairo\" and exotic habitations===\nThe Rue de Caire (\"Street of Cairo\") was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of [[Cairo]].  It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it.  It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl\u00e9on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the [[Suez Canal]].  It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings,  a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo.  The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.\n\nThe Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:La rue du Caire.

The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. \n\nThe Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect [[Albert Ballu]], who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments.  After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to [[Buenos Aires]], where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}} \n\n\nIn addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electrify pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. \nThe Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products.  One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from [[Champagne Mercier]] that could hold two thousand bottles of  champagne, {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}}\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|The Pavilion of Argentina, winner of the contest for best national pavilion\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n chileno en la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds de 1889-cropped.jpg|Pavilion of Chile\nFile:Pavilion of Brazil, Paris Exposition, 1889 LCCN92520980.jpg|Pavilion of Brazil \nFile:Paris Exposition train 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Algeria, with the Exposition train \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537046 (3784010239).jpg|Pavilion of Persia \nFile:Pavilion of India, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of India \nFile:Pavilion of Siam, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Siam \nFile:Palais du Mexican, Paris Exposition, 1889 (14382646444).jpg|Pavilion of Mexico\nFile:Pavilion of Nicaragua and base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Nicaragua\nFile:\u00a8Pavillon des \u00eeles Hawa\u00ef - Exposition universelle Paris 1889.jpg|Paviiion of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] \nFile:Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, in Egyptian style\nFile:Le palais des produits alimentaires, Exposition universelle 1889.jpg|The Palace of Food Products\nFile:Epernay fass mercier side view.jpg|A gigantic oak barrel with a capacity of 200 000 bottles of champagne was a feature of the [[Champagne Mercier]] exhibit at the food and wine pavilion. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Charles Garnier's ''History of Habitation'' ===\nAn unusual display was the \"History of Habitation\" designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] named for him. He was then sixty-one, and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera.  He had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, denouncing the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity. Despite this, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation.  These houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n\nThe houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas.  These dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historic accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular.  The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 \"Casa egipcia\" (3784820432).jpg|The Egyptian House of the History of Habitation, by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537073 (3784014313).jpg|The Aztec House and Incan House by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537049 (3784820368).jpg|The Roman House and the Gallo-Roman House, by Charles Garnier\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMany smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition.  The architect [[Hector Guimard]], then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren.  The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.\n\n{{quote|the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features.  In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now-a-days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.}}\n\n==Science and technology==\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology.

The most notable surivor was the [[Eiffel Tower]], which had been deliberately built on Paris city-owned land, to avoid demolition.\n\nThe Exhibition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre-Henri Picq.  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort-de-France]] in [[Martinique]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Exposition Universelle (1878)]]\n*[[Champ de Mars, Paris]]\n*[[Colonial Exhibition]]\n*[[Human zoo]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Ageorges, Sylvain (2006), ''Sur les traces des Expositions Universelles'' (in French), Parigramme. {{ISBN|978-28409-6444-5}}\n* Jonnes, Jill, ''Eiffel's Tower'' (2013), Penguin Putnam {{ISBN|978-01431-1729-2}}\n* Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay,  ''1889 - La Tour Eiffel et l'Exposition Universelle'' (1989) (in French), \u00c9ditions de la R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Paris {{ISBN|2-7118-2244-3}} (Catalog of a centennial exhibition on the Expositon in 1989) \n* ''Engineering'' [Journal] 3 May 1889 (vol XLVII), London: Office for Advertisements and Publication, 1866- (ISSN 0013-7782)\n* ''Structural iron and steel,'' 1850-1900, edited by Robert Thorne; Aldershot, Hampshire, Great Britain; Burlington, Vt., USA: Ashgate/Variorum, c2000 ({{ISBN|0860787591}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Exposition Universelle (1889)}}\n*Young, P.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''. It is not closely related to the [[American robin]] or the [[European robin]]; however, it is named after the European robin.<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\"/> Molecular research (and current consensus) places the red-capped robin and its relatives\u2014the Australian robin family [[Petroicidae]]\u2014as a very early offshoot of the [[Passerida]], or \"advanced\" songbirds, within the [[songbird]] lineage.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Barker, F.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]].

The political arguments focused on two areas. Firstly, there were concerns over the government using foreign troops within the British isles, which was seen as a threat to British political liberty. Secondly, that by recruiting Frenchmen Britain was changing the nature of the war with France, and showing that it wanted to overturn the French Revolutionary government. [[Charles James Fox]], one of the MPs who said most on this, thought the war would be longer and more violent as a result, and negotiating a peace much harder. Despite these concerns being raised in Parliament, the government had enough of a majority for the bill to pass, although votes where held at each stage.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 9780230319684| pages = 59-60| editor-last1 = Arielli| editor1-first = Nir| editor-last2 = Collins| editor2-first = Bruce| last = Linch| first = Kevin| title = Transnational Soldiers: Foreign Military Enlistment in the Modern Era| chapter = The Politics of Foreign Recruitment in Britain during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars| location = Basingstoke| date = 2012 |doi= 10.1057/9781137296634_4 }}</ref> \n\n===Passage through Parliament===\n* Ordered: 7 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=429|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA429}}</ref>\n* Presented and read; ordered to be printed: 8 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=441|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA441}}</ref>\n* Committed: 11 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=458|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA458}}</ref>\n* Considered: 14 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=464|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA464}}</ref>\n* Reported; to be ingrossed; day appointed for Third Reading: 16 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |pages=478-479|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA478}}</ref>\n* Passed: 17 April 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=487|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA487}}</ref>\n* Agreed to in the [[House of Lords]]: 6 May 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=558|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA558}}</ref>\n* Received Royal Assent: 9 May 1794<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Re-printed by Order of The House of Commons| volume = 49| title = The Journals of the House of Commons| date = 1803 |page=568|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GBZDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA568}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of the Act==\n\n==Sources about the Act==\n'''Parliamentary debates''': {{Cite book| publisher = T.

V. Meiyappan]] and directed by [[S. Balachander]]. It is the first [[film noir]] in [[Tamil cinema]], and the first Tamil film to be made without songs, dance, or stunt sequences. Set in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|milieu of World War II]], the story is about the killing of a radio engineer Rajan ([[Sivaji Ganesan]]). The suspects are Rajan's wife Usha ([[Pandari Bai]]), the neighbour Chinnaiya Pillai ([[P. D. Sambandam]]), Rajan's brother Pattabi ([[T. K. Balachandran]]), Rajan's sister-in-law Hema (Menaka), and Rajan's mistress Ambujam (Suryakala). Each one's account of the incident points to a new suspect.\n\nBalachander watched [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950) at a film festival, was inspired by it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by [[All India Radio]]; Meiyappan later agreed to produce it as the film that would later be titled ''Andha Naal'' under [[AVM Productions]]. The screenplay was written by [[Javar Seetharaman]], who also played a prominent role as an investigative officer in the film. Cinematography was handled by [[S. Maruti Rao]], and the background score was composed by AVM's own music troupe, Saraswathy Stores Orchestra. The film was shorter than most contemporaneous Tamil films. It was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM.\n\n''Andha Naal'' was released on 13 April 1954, on the eve of ''[[Puthandu]]'' (Tamil New Year). It was critically acclaimed and was awarded a [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Certificate of Merit for Second Best Feature Film in Tamil]] at the [[2nd National Film Awards]] in 1955. Despite being a commercial failure at the time of its original release, it has acquired [[Cult film|cult status]] over the years, and is regarded as an important film in Tamil cinema. In 2013, ''Andha Naal'' was included in [[CNN-News18]]'s list of the \"100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time\".\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the night of 11 October 1943, during [[World War II]],{{Sfn|Pillai|2015|p=268}} Japanese forces bomb the Indian city of Madras (now [[Chennai]]). The next morning, Rajan, a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own hand gun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiya Pillai, having heard the gunshot, informs the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death. [[Criminal Investigation Department (India)|Criminal Investigation Department]] (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu to help with the investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene. However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because the amount of money at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room. Rajan was about to leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings.\n\nThe two policemen question five people in and around Rajan's house, most of whom are his family members or friends. The first to be questioned is Rajan's wife Usha, who is unable to speak because of her grief. Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further. They begin interrogating Chinnaiya Pillai, who reported the gunshot. Chinnaiya Pillai proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother, and recalls a confrontation between them: Pattabi asked for his share of the family property but Rajan refused his request, feeling that he and his wife would squander it. Chinnaiya Pillai concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan.\n\nWhen Sivanandam and Naidu interrogate Pattabi, who feels remorse for Rajan's death, he admits that he did not treat his brother well nor understand his good intentions. He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema fought with Rajan because he refused to apportion the property. Pattabi says Hema could have killed Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.\n\nSivanandam leaves Naidu to interrogate Hema. She is initially impudent and refuses to give a statement about the crime, but she later agrees when Sivanandam threatens to arrest her husband. She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with Ambujam, a dancer who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated the news with a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam could have killed him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiya Pillai of murdering Rajan, saying Chinnaiya Pillai was her foster father and wanted her to stay away from Rajan after the three met during a picnic. As their relationship continued, Chinnaiya Pillai became infuriated and wanted to end the affair.\n\nSivanandam interrogates Usha, who tells him how she and Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky [[fountain pen]] in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspects{{mdash}}including Usha{{mdash}}must pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. Chinnaiya Pillai, Pattabi and Hema shoot him as instructed, but Usha fails to do so and bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- According to the opening credits -->\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Rajan{{Sfn|Pillai|2015|p=265}}\n* [[Pandari Bai]] as Usha{{Sfn|Pillai|2015|p=265}}\n* [[Javar Seetharaman]] as C.I.D.

V. Meiyappan]] and directed by [[S. Balachander]]. It is the first [[film noir]] in [[Tamil cinema]], and the first Tamil film to be made without songs, dance, or stunt sequences. Set in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|milieu of World War II]], the story is about the killing of a radio engineer Rajan ([[Sivaji Ganesan]]). The suspects are Rajan's wife Usha ([[Pandari Bai]]), the neighbour Chinnaiya Pillai ([[P. D. Sambandam]]), Rajan's brother Pattabi ([[T. K. Balachandran]]), Rajan's sister-in-law Hema (Menaka), and Rajan's mistress Ambujam (Suryakala). Each one's account of the incident points to a new suspect.\n\nBalachander watched [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950) at a film festival, was inspired by it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by [[All India Radio]]; Meiyappan later agreed to produce it as the film that would later be titled ''Andha Naal'' under [[AVM Productions]]. The screenplay was written by [[Javar Seetharaman]], who also played a prominent role as an investigative officer in the film. Cinematography was handled by [[S. Maruti Rao]], and the background score was composed by AVM's own music troupe, Saraswathy Stores Orchestra. The film was shorter than most contemporaneous Tamil films. It was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM.\n\n''Andha Naal'' was released on 13 April 1954, on the eve of ''[[Puthandu]]'' (Tamil New Year). It was critically acclaimed and was awarded a [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Certificate of Merit for Second Best Feature Film in Tamil]] at the [[2nd National Film Awards]] in 1955. Despite being a commercial failure at the time of its original release, it has acquired [[Cult film|cult status]] over the years, and is regarded as an important film in Tamil cinema. In 2013, ''Andha Naal'' was included in [[CNN-News18]]'s list of the \"100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time\".\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the night of 11 October 1943, during [[World War II]],{{Sfn|Pillai|2015|p=268}} Japanese forces bomb the Indian city of Madras (now [[Chennai]]). The next morning, Rajan, a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own hand gun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiya Pillai, having heard the gunshot, complains to the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death. [[Criminal Investigation Department (India)|Criminal Investigation Department]] (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu to help with the investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene. However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because the amount of money at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room. Rajan was about to leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings.\n\nThe two policemen question five people in and around Rajan's house, most of whom are his family members or friends. The first to be questioned is Rajan's wife Usha, who is unable to speak because of her grief. Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further. They begin interrogating Chinnaiya Pillai, who reported the gunshot. Chinnaiya Pillai proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother, and recalls a confrontation between them: Pattabi asked for his share of the family property but Rajan refused his request, feeling that he and his wife would squander it. Chinnaiya Pillai concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan.\n\nWhen Sivanandam and Naidu interrogate Pattabi, who feels remorse for Rajan's death, he admits that he did not treat his brother well nor understand his good intentions. He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema fought with Rajan because he refused to apportion the property. Pattabi says Hema could have killed Rajan for the money as she loses her sanity when overpowered by anger.\n\nSivanandam leaves Naidu to interrogate Hema. She is initially impudent and refuses to give a statement about the crime, but she later agrees when Sivanandam threatens to arrest her husband. She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with Ambujam, a dancer who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated the news with a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam could have killed him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiya Pillai of murdering Rajan, saying Chinnaiya Pillai was her foster father and wanted her to stay away from Rajan after the three met during a picnic. As their relationship continued, Chinnaiya Pillai became infuriated and wanted to end the affair.\n\nSivanandam interrogates Usha, who tells him how she and Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky [[fountain pen]] in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspects{{mdash}}including Usha{{mdash}}must pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. Chinnaiya Pillai, Pattabi and Hema shoot him as instructed, but Usha fails to do so and bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- According to the opening credits -->\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Rajan{{Sfn|Pillai|2015|p=265}}\n* [[Pandari Bai]] as Usha{{Sfn|Pillai|2015|p=265}}\n* [[Javar Seetharaman]] as C.I.D.

The cathedral is that of St. Parakevi in Therapia (Tarabya). The metropolitan is a member of the Patriarchal Synod. The present Metropolitan is Apostolos Daniilidis.\n\n==History==\nThe village of Derkos/Derkoi (modern Durusu or Terkos) is attested since [[Classical Antiquity]], but Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (r. 491\u2013518) raised it to the status of a city and rebuilt it as a forward stronghold for the defence of [[Constantinople]]. Probably at the same time it was created as an [[episcopal see]] (\"Bishopric of Derkoi and Chele\", \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae \u0394\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a7\u03b7\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2).<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> In the first half of the 6th century, the town and the see were known as a stronghold of the [[Monophysites]].<ref name=\"TIB12\">{{Tabula Imperii Byzantini | volume = 12|url=http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/3945-4inhalt?frames=yes|pages=330\u2013332}}</ref> \n\nThe see was a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]] of [[Heraclea Perinthus|Heraclea]] until the 10th century, when it became an [[autocephalous]] [[archbishopric]].<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> Bishop Gregory I took part in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787; Macarius I participated in the council of 879, Archbishop Constantine participated in the anti-[[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] council of 1030, and an unnamed archbishop took part in the [[Council of Blachernae (1082)|Council of Blachernae]] against [[John Italos]] in 1082.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> In 1166, Archbishop John II tried repeatedly, but without success, to have his see moved to nearby [[Philea (city)|Philea]]. An archbishop Michael is attested in a latter of 1177 to the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicos]] of [[Armenian Cilicia]] [[Gregory IV the Young]], and an archbishop Gregory in a synod in February 1197.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> \n\nIn the period of [[Latin Empire|Latin rule]] in 1204\u201347, a Catholic bishop was installed over the see (''Derkensem''), which was subordinated directly to the [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]].<ref name=\"TIB12\"/>\n\nThe anonymous archbishop of Derkoi co-signed the Acts of Union with the Catholic Church in July 1274. In 1285, Archbishop Constantine co-signed the ''[[tomos]]'' against the deposed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[John Bekkos]]. Archbishop Macarius presided over the see in ca. 1289\u201394, but it seems to have fallen vacant in the early 14th century: during the patriarchate of [[Nephon I of Constantinople|Nephon I]] (1310\u201314), the proceeds of the see were transferred directly to the patriarchal see and, in April 1316, Metropolitan Theodoulos of [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]] was appointed acting administrator (''[[proedros]]'').<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> \n\nThe see was restored by March 1324, when Archbishop Loukas is attested, serving at least until 1329. In the same year (1324), the see's annual contributions to the patriarchate were fixed at 24 ''[[hyperpyra]]''. Archbishop Gabriel is attested as a signatory of the ''tomos'' of 1351, endorsing the views of [[Gregory Palamas]] and ending the [[Hesychast controversy]]. In 1355, the see was briefly united with the [[Metropolis of Bizye]], under Neophytus.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> Following the conquest of [[Heraclea Pontica]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1360, in January 1365 the Archbishopric of Derkoi was assigned to the Metropolitan of Heraclea to support him through its proceeds. This lasted until ca. March 1371, when the archbishop is again attested as a separate entity.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> By September 1379, Derkoi was itself raised to a metropolitan see, with the first metropolitan being Paul, who remained in office at least until May 1384. From February 1389 to October 1400, the see was under Metropolitan Joseph.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> An anonymous incumbent is attested in 1403, but after that the see probably remained vacant due to the Ottoman devastation of the area until about August 1409, when a new incumbent (Basil) is attested.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/> The last metropolitan before the [[Fall of Constantinople]] was Acacius, mentioned in late 1452, shortly before the town itself was captured by the Ottomans.<ref name=\"TIB12\"/>\n\nUnder Ottoman rule it was a little village south-west of [[Karaburun]], a promontory on the Black Sea, and on the southern bank of Lake Derkos, the waters of which are brought to Constantinople by an aqueduct. There were about 300 inhabitants. In 1466, it was ruled directly by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [Kambouroglou, Monuments for History of Athens (Gr.), II, 354]. It was not re-established until the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the titular resided at [[Therapia]] on the Bosporus.\n\nIn October 1746, it was raised to the eighth rank of the Greek hierarchy (Mansi, Col. concil., XXXVIII, 527). The diocese included 41 villages in the vicinity of [[Constantinople]] and along the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]], among them San Stefano, [[Makrik\u00f6y]] and [[B\u00fcy\u00fckdere, Istanbul|B\u00fcy\u00fckdere]], with Catholic parishes conducted by [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Minor Conventuals]].\n\nIn 1821, during the [[Constantinople Massacre of 1821|massacre that broke out in Constantinople]], as a retaliation of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the metropolitan bishop of Derkoi, Gregory, was among the Greek Orthodox upper clergy that was executed by the Ottoman authorities.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael (Editor) |last=Angold|title=The Cambridge history of Christianity|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

During that time, he worked closely with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], the [[Carter administration]]'s architect of [[Operation Cyclone]] to support the [[mujahideen]], who resisted the [[Soviet Union]]'s invasion of Afghanistan.<ref name=\"ihouse\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Khalilzad accepted a one-year [[Council on Foreign Relations]] fellowship to join the [[US State Department]], where he was an adviser to the [[Near East]] and [[South Asia]] Bureau, headed by [[Richard W. Murphy]].\n\nFrom 1985 to 1989, Khalilzad served in the [[Reagan administration]], as a senior State Department official, advising on the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], after the Soviet invasion. During that time, he was a member of the [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] and the State Department's Special Adviser on Afghanistan to Undersecretary of State [[Michael H. Armacost]]. In that role, he developed and guided the international program to promote the merits of a mujahideen-led Afghanistan ousting the Soviet occupation. From 1990 to 1992, Khalilzad served under President [[George H. W. Bush]] in the [[US Defense Department]], as Deputy Undersecretary for Policy Planning.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2000, Khalilzad was the director of the Strategy, Doctrine, and Force Structure at the RAND Corporation. During that time, he helped found RAND's Center for Middle Eastern Studies as well as \"Strategic Appraisal,\" a RAND periodical. He also authored several influential monographs, including \"The United States and a Rising China\" and \"From Containment to Global Leadership? America and the World After the Cold War.\" At RAND, he also had a brief stint in consulting for [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]], which was conducting a risk analysis for [[Unocal]], now part of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], for a proposed 1400 km (890 mi), $2-billion, 622 m\u00b3/s (22,000 ft\u00b3/s) [[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline|Trans-Afghanistan gas pipeline]] project, which would have extended from [[Turkmenistan]] to Afghanistan and then proceeded to [[Pakistan]].\n\n===Support for U.S. global leadership===\nKhalilzad also wrote several articles on the subject of the value of U.S. global leadership in the mid-1990s. The specific scenarios for conflict that he envisioned if a decline in American power occurred have made his writings extremely popular in competitive high school and college [[policy debate]], particularly his writing that links the loss of US hegemony to global instability.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | author = Khalilzad, Zalmay\n | year = 1995\n | title = Losing the moment?

During that time, he worked closely with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], the [[Carter administration]]'s architect of [[Operation Cyclone]] to support the [[mujahideen]], who resisted the [[Soviet Union]]'s invasion of Afghanistan.<ref name=\"ihouse\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Khalilzad accepted a one-year [[Council on Foreign Relations]] fellowship to join the [[US State Department]], where he was an adviser to the [[Near East]] and [[South Asia]] Bureau, headed by [[Richard W. Murphy]].\n\nFrom 1985 to 1989, Khalilzad served in the [[Reagan administration]], as a senior State Department official, advising on the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], after the Soviet invasion. During that time, he was a member of the [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] and the State Department's Special Adviser on Afghanistan to Undersecretary of State [[Michael H. Armacost]]. In that role, he developed and guided the international program to promote the merits of a mujahideen-led Afghanistan ousting the Soviet occupation. From 1990 to 1992, Khalilzad served under President [[George H. W. Bush]] in the [[US Defense Department]], as Deputy Undersecretary for Policy Planning.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2000, Khalilzad was the director of the Strategy, Doctrine, and Force Structure at the RAND Corporation. During that time, he helped found RAND's Center for Middle Eastern Studies as well as \"Strategic Appraisal,\" a RAND periodical. He also authored several influential monographs, including \"The United States and a Rising China\" and \"From Containment to Global Leadership? America and the World After the Cold War.\" At RAND, he also had a brief stint in consulting for [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]], which was conducting a risk analysis for [[Unocal]], now part of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], for a proposed 1400 km (890 mi), $2-billion, 622 m\u00b3/s (22,000 ft\u00b3/s) [[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline|Trans-Afghanistan gas pipeline]] project, which would have extended from [[Turkmenistan]] to Afghanistan and then proceeded to [[Pakistan]].\n\n===Support for U.S. global leadership===\nKhalilzad also wrote several articles on the subject of the value of U.S. global leadership in the mid-1990s. The specific scenarios for conflict that he envisioned if a decline in American power occurred have made his writings extremely popular in competitive high school and college [[policy debate]], particularly his writing that links the loss of US hegemony to global instability.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | author = Khalilzad, Zalmay\n | year = 1995\n | title = Losing the moment?

In May 2001, National Security Adviser [[Condoleezza Rice]] announced Khalilzad's appointment as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Southwest Asia, Near East, and [[North African]] Affairs at the [[US National Security Council]].

Khalilzad was involved in the early stages of planning to overthrow the [[Taliban]] and on December 31, 2001, he was selected as Bush's Special Presidential Envoy for Afghanistan.

At the June 2002 Loya Jirga to select the Head of State,  representatives of the US convinced the former king of Afghanistan, 87-year-old [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], to withdraw from consideration even though a majority of Loya Jirga delegates supported him.

{"title_page": "Non-FIFA international football", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[FIFA]] is the international [[governing body]] of [[association football]], overseeing football globally and with running international representative matches. However, some [[association football|international football]] takes place outside its ratification. This often consists of matches involving sub-national entities such as [[islands]], [[colony|colonies]] or [[List of autonomous areas by country|autonomous regions]]. Representative matches also occur involving [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited international recognition]] who are unable to qualify for FIFA membership. There are also a limited number of states whose representative teams are not affiliated to FIFA. Historically, a number of competitions occurred outside FIFA's auspices.\n\n==\"National\" teams==\nBroadly-speaking, there are five categories of Non-FIFA national team:\n\n===States===\nTeams representing seven small sovereign states ([[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Kiribati]], [[Monaco]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Tuvalu]], and the [[Vatican City]]) have played international football but are not affiliated to FIFA. [[Kiribati]] and [[Tuvalu]] are Associate Members of [[Oceania Football Confederation]] but not its parent organisation.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] is represented in FIFA through its four constituent countries &ndash; [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. During the 1940s and 50s a [[United Kingdom national football team]] was assembled on a few occasions to play friendly matches which were not considered full internationals by FIFA.\n\n===Autonomous (or autonomy-seeking) regions and unrecognised states===\nA second category encompasses regions of larger nations which have a history of autonomy. They may have already achieved a degree of self-governance (for example the [[autonomous communities of Spain]] including [[Catalonia national football team|Catalonia]], [[Galicia national football team|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country national football team|Basque Country]] which usually play just one game a year, traditionally at [[Christmas]]), or be seeking it (like for example the french historic region of [[Brittany national football team|Brittany]]). However, it is necessary to distinguish the [[Basque Country national football team|Basque team]] from the others, as it has come to represent not just the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|'Basque autonomous community']], but the [[Basque Country (greater region)|'greater Basque region']], also incorporating [[Navarre]] and the [[French Basque Country]].\n\nAlternatively, some [[list of unrecognised states|unrecognised states]] may have national teams. Some established members of [[UEFA]] once fell into this category, such as the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Current non-FIFA heavyweights [[Northern Cyprus national football team|Northern Cyprus]] are the best example of this category of non-FIFA football team.\n\n===Regional associations===\nThe first, and most common, are teams which represent the regional associations of established footballing nations. These oversee local football in their respective regions and are part of a network of associations that contribute to the national association as a whole. A good example of this would be [[Jersey Football Association|Jersey]], whose members are also members of the [[the Football Association|FA]]. These regional associations often enter representative teams into international non-FIFA matches.\n\n===Stateless people===\nThe third group of teams features representative sides drawn from ethnic groups that have yet to gain significant control over a home state, or drawn from an ethnic [[diaspora]]. The [[Sami people]] of [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|Lapland]] live in a distinct area of northern [[Scandinavia]], yet fall under the control of four states. Nevertheless, they have organised a football association and a representative team. Similarly, the [[Romani people]]\u2014having been strewn across [[Europe]] for centuries\u2014have a fledgeling footballing organisation to represent them in international competition. Other stateless nations, such as the [[Palestine national football team|Palestinians]] have been welcomed into FIFA and the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] despite having no recognised state. The Esperanto Football Team has been set up to represent the worldwide community of [[Esperanto]] speakers.\n\n===Minorities===\nAnother group of teams consist of ethnic minorities in a state.\n\n==Organizations==\n* '''[[N.F.-Board]] - New Federations Board''': a now-defunct football association established in 2003. It was made up of teams that represent nations that were not recognized as sovereign states and which are therefore not eligible to become members of FIFA, football's world governing body. The NF-Board organised the VIVA World Cup and the UNPO Cup. The N.F. Board has been inactive since 2013 and is considered defunct. \n* '''[http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conselho_Sul-Americano_de_Novas_Federa\u00e7\u00f5es CSANF] - Consejo Sul-Americano de Nuevas Federaciones''': was its first continental confederation, for South America, established n 2007. The CSANF is currently active.\n* '''[[Confederation of Independent Football Associations|CONIFA]] - Confederation of Independent Football Associations''': from confederations homepage: ''CONIFA is a global umbrella organization for all the football teams outside FIFA. There are more than 5,500 ethnicities around the world and hundreds of sportingly isolated regions that don't have an international arena to play international football. CONIFA welcome all registered Football Associations and teams to play. We organize the official World Championship for teams outside FIFA, Continental Championships, International tournament and Cups combined with Cultural Events and Youth Exchanges.''.<ref name=CONIFA>{{cite web|url=http://www.conifa.org/|title=Confederation of Independent Football Associations|website=[[Confederation of Independent Football Associations|CONIFA]]}}</ref> As of 2018, ConIFA has more than 40 member associations.\n* '''[[International Island Games Association|IIGA]] - International Island Games Association''': formed in 1985, this is an organization with the sole purpose to organise the Island Games, a friendly biennial athletic competition (including football) between teams from several islands and other small territories.\n\n==Non-FIFA competitions==\n\nFootball tournaments at international multi-sports events, such as the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], [[Pan-American Games]] and [[Jeux de la Francophonie|Francophone games]] are without FIFA's jurisdiction, but are, for the most part, operated with the acknowledgement of that body.  These events typically involve age restricted teams, to avoid direct competition with the World Cup and continental championships.\n\n===Men's tournaments===\n\n====International====\n\n===== The FIFI Wild Cup =====\n\nThe [[FIFI Wild Cup]] was organised by the German football club [[St. Pauli FC|St. Pauli]] in the summer of 2006. It took place while the [[FIFA World Cup]] was being played in Germany, and aimed to raise awareness of stateless nations. Five nations took part, along with a team representing the St Pauli district of [[Hamburg]]. [[Northern Cyprus national football team|Northern Cyprus]] beat [[Zanzibar national football team|Zanzibar]] on penalties to win the trophy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

It was the first ever European Championship between representative teams outside FIFA. The 12 representative teams: [[Ellan Vannin football team|Ellan Vannin]], [[County of Nice]], [[Abkhazia]], [[Nagorno Karabakh]], [[South Ossetia]], [[Occitania]], [[Romani People]], [[Franconia]], [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|Sapmi]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Szekely Land]] and [[Padania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://conifaofficial.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/padania-12th-team-european-football-cup/|title=European Football Cup: Padania 12th participant|website=conifaofficial.wordpress.com|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref> Subsequently, 3 teams ([[Franconia]], [[Monaco]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]) cancelled their participation for the [[2015 ConIFA European Football Cup]] in [[Hungary]], which forced the originally planned schedule to be revised. The presence of a total of nine teams led to three groups of three being formed. In May 2015, [[Occitania]] also announced their withdrawal from the competition, which led to another revision of the match schedule into two groups of four, which ConIFA based upon their ranking points system. In June 2015, another three teams, [[South Ossetia]], [[Abkhazia]] and [[Northern Cyprus]], were all forced to withdraw, as a result of visa difficulties, while the [[Felvidek]] team was added to the line up - leaving two groups of three and six participants in total.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

However, some [[association football|international football]] takes place outside its ratification. This often consists of matches involving sub-national entities such as [[islands]], [[colony|colonies]] or [[List of autonomous areas by country|autonomous regions]]. Representative matches also occur involving [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited international recognition]] who are unable to qualify for FIFA membership. There are also a limited number of states whose representative teams are not affiliated to FIFA. Historically, a number of competitions occurred outside FIFA's auspices.\n\n==\"National\" teams==\nBroadly-speaking, there are five categories of Non-FIFA national team:\n\n===States===\nTeams representing seven small sovereign states ([[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Kiribati]], [[Monaco]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Tuvalu]], and the [[Vatican City]]) have played international football but are not affiliated to FIFA. [[Kiribati]] and [[Tuvalu]] are Associate Members of [[Oceania Football Confederation]] but not its parent organisation.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] is represented in FIFA through its four constituent countries &ndash; [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. During the 1940s and 50s a [[United Kingdom national football team]] was assembled on a few occasions to play friendly matches which were not considered full internationals by FIFA.\n\n===Autonomous (or autonomy-seeking) regions and unrecognised states===\nA second category encompasses regions of larger nations which have a history of autonomy. They may have already achieved a degree of self-governance (for example the [[autonomous communities of Spain]] including [[Catalonia national football team|Catalonia]], [[Galicia national football team|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country national football team|Basque Country]] which usually play just one game a year, traditionally at [[Christmas]]), or be seeking it (like for example the french historic region of [[Brittany national football team|Brittany]]). However, it is necessary to distinguish the [[Basque Country national football team|Basque team]] from the others, as it has come to represent not just the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|'Basque autonomous community']], but the [[Basque Country (greater region)|'greater Basque region']], also incorporating [[Navarre]] and the [[French Basque Country]].\n\nAlternatively, some [[list of unrecognised states|unrecognised states]] may have national teams. Some established members of [[UEFA]] once fell into this category, such as the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]]. Current non-FIFA heavyweights [[Northern Cyprus national football team|Northern Cyprus]] are the best example of this category of non-FIFA football team.\n\n===Regional associations===\nThe first, and most common, are teams which represent the regional associations of established footballing nations. These oversee local football in their respective regions and are part of a network of associations that contribute to the national association as a whole. A good example of this would be [[Jersey Football Association|Jersey]], whose members are also members of the [[the Football Association|FA]]. These regional associations often enter representative teams into international non-FIFA matches.\n\n===Stateless people===\nThe third group of teams features representative sides drawn from ethnic groups that have yet to gain significant control over a home state, or drawn from an ethnic [[diaspora]]. The [[Sami people]] of [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|Lapland]] live in a distinct area of northern [[Scandinavia]], yet fall under the control of four states. Nevertheless, they have organised a football association and a representative team. Similarly, the [[Romani people]]\u2014having been strewn across [[Europe]] for centuries\u2014have a fledgeling footballing organisation to represent them in international competition. Other stateless nations, such as the [[Palestine national football team|Palestinians]] have been welcomed into FIFA and the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] despite having no recognised state. The Esperanto Football Team has been set up to represent the worldwide community of [[Esperanto]] speakers.\n\n===Minorities===\nAnother group of teams consist of ethnic minorities in a state.\n\n==Organizations==\n* '''[[N.F.-Board]] - New Federations Board''': a now-defunct football association established in 2003. It was made up of teams that represent nations that were not recognized as sovereign states and which are therefore not eligible to become members of FIFA, football's world governing body. The NF-Board organised the VIVA World Cup and the UNPO Cup. The N.F. Board has been inactive since 2013 and is considered defunct. \n* '''[http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conselho_Sul-Americano_de_Novas_Federa\u00e7\u00f5es CSANF] - Consejo Sul-Americano de Nuevas Federaciones''': was its first continental confederation, for South America, established n 2007. The CSANF is currently active.\n* '''[[Confederation of Independent Football Associations|CONIFA]] - Confederation of Independent Football Associations''': from confederations homepage: ''CONIFA is a global umbrella organization for all the football teams outside FIFA. There are more than 5,500 ethnicities around the world and hundreds of sportingly isolated regions that don't have an international arena to play international football. CONIFA welcome all registered Football Associations and teams to play. We organize the official World Championship for teams outside FIFA, Continental Championships, International tournament and Cups combined with Cultural Events and Youth Exchanges.''.<ref name=CONIFA>{{cite web|url=http://www.conifa.org/|title=Confederation of Independent Football Associations|website=[[Confederation of Independent Football Associations|CONIFA]]}}</ref> As of 2018, ConIFA has more than 40 member associations.\n* '''[[International Island Games Association|IIGA]] - International Island Games Association''': formed in 1985, this is an organization with the sole purpose to organise the Island Games, a friendly biennial athletic competition (including football) between teams from several islands and other small territories.\n\n==Non-FIFA competitions==\n\nFootball tournaments at international multi-sports events, such as the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], [[Pan-American Games]] and [[Jeux de la Francophonie|Francophone games]] are without FIFA's jurisdiction, but are, for the most part, operated with the acknowledgement of that body.  These events typically involve age restricted teams, to avoid direct competition with the World Cup and continental championships.\n\n===Men's tournaments===\n\n====International====\n\n===== The FIFI Wild Cup =====\n\nThe [[FIFI Wild Cup]] was organised by the German football club [[St. Pauli FC|St. Pauli]] in the summer of 2006. It took place while the [[FIFA World Cup]] was being played in Germany, and aimed to raise awareness of stateless nations. Five nations took part, along with a team representing the St Pauli district of [[Hamburg]]. [[Northern Cyprus national football team|Northern Cyprus]] beat [[Zanzibar national football team|Zanzibar]] on penalties to win the trophy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. Along the meridional border of the [[Guettioua Formation]], on the same Stratigraphic tendence is developed a red Sandstone-Pelitic deposition, that changes from Quartzo-[[Conglomerate]]s to grains and fragments of Quartz, dispossed with liassic Calcareous strata.<ref name=Taquet1 /><ref name=Taquet2 /> is equivalent to the main Azilal \"Marnes Chocolat\".<ref name=Taquet1 /><ref name=Taquet2 /> The Main sector occurs near Acfarcid, with an expossure of ~800 m, recovering the most detritic sector. Along this expossure, the Wazzant member appaears at the right lateral, along massive calcareous [[Dolomite]]s, over the Latest [[Pliensbachian]] strata, where the lower Toarcian strata is missing.<ref name=Taquet1 /> The Wazzant facies never exceed 50 m, getting it\u00b4s maximum exposure at the north of the [[Guettioua Formation]].<ref name=Taquet1 /> The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys Ocean]] to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).
