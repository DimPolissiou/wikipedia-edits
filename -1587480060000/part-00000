Inland posts [[Asleep by the frozen sea|were not built]] until 1774. After 1774, York Factory became the main post because of its convenient access to the vast interior waterway systems of the [[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] and [[Red River of the North|Red]] rivers. Called \"factories\" (because the \"[[Factor (agent)|factor]],\" i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in [[New Netherland]]s. By adoption of the Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the \"[[Made Beaver]]\" (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents.

They established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages, and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region, learning their languages and often forming alliances through marriages with indigenous women. In March 1686, the French sent a [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)|raiding party]] under the [[Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes|Chevalier des Troyes]] more than {{convert|1300|km|abbr=on}} to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to strategic deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France [[King William's War|were officially at war]], and the conflict played out in North America as well. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory.

D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by laying siege to the fort and pretending to be a much larger army. The French retained all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713. (A small French and Indian force attacked Fort Albany again [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|in 1709]] during [[Queen Anne's War]] but was unsuccessful.

In the years that followed, thousands of emigrants poured into the [[Willamette Valley]] of Oregon. In 1846, the United States acquired full authority south of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]; the most settled areas of the Oregon Country were south of the [[Columbia River]] in what is now Oregon.

Company trapping brigades were sent south from Fort Vancouver, along what became known as the [[Siskiyou Trail]], into Northern California as far south as the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where the company operated a trading post at [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (San Francisco).

Sayer, a [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] trapper and trader, was accused of illegal trading in furs. The Court of [[Assiniboia]] brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed M\u00e9tis men led by [[Louis Riel, Sr.]] gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge [[Adam Thom]] did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, ''Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!'' (\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\"), the M\u00e9tis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother factor was the findings of the [[Palliser Expedition]] of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain [[John Palliser]]. He surveyed the area of the prairies and wilderness from Lake Superior to the southern passes of the Rocky Mountains. Although he recommended against settlement of the region, the report sparked a debate. It ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company: that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1863, the [[International Financial Society]] bought controlling interest in the HBC, signalling a shift in the company's outlook: most of the new shareholders were less interested in the fur trade than in real estate speculation and economic development in the West. The Society floated \u00a32 million in public shares on non-ceded land held ostensibly by the Hudson's Bay Company as an asset and leveraged this asset for collateral for these funds. These funds allowed the Society the financial means to weather the financial collapse of 1866 which destroyed many competitors and invest in railways in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb50-udfs|title=Records of the International Finance Society|work=Archives Hub|publisher=[[Jisc]]|accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SketchesGrizzly.jpeg|thumb|left|''A rough and tumble with a [[grizzly]]'' (Harry Bullock-Webster)]]\n\nIn 1869, after rejecting the American government offer of {{CAD|10,000,000}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405101925/http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2007 |title=John A.

She was closing stores and selling assets \"to put the company on more solid financial footing\" and could then \"focus on the two remaining 'crown jewels' in her portfolio: Saks Fifth Avenue and the Bay\".

In 1974, Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) were transferred from London and placed on deposit with the Manitoba archives in Winnipeg. The company granted public access to the collection the following year.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 27 January 1994, the company's archives were formally donated to the Archives of Manitoba.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBCA History |website=Hudson's Bay Company Archives |publisher=Government of Manitoba |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |access-date=6 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925004135/http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the donation, the appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million.

This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants.  Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts.  They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records.  In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods.  These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. [[Made Beaver|Made-Beaver]], the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |first2=Frank D. |last2=Lewis |title=Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of Hudson's Bay Company, 1700\u20131763 |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=465\u2013494 |date=September 1993 |jstor=2122402 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700013450}}</ref><ref name=\"Judd\">{{cite journal |last=Judd |first=Carol |title=Native labour and social stratification in Hudson's Bay Company's Northern Department, 1770\u20131870 |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013314 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x }}</ref>\n\n;Hierarchichal order pre-1821<ref name=\"Judd\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"50\" | #\n! align=\"center\" width=\"360\" | Job Title\n|-\n|||''' ''OFFICERS'' ''' \n|-\n| 1 || ''Chief Factor'' \n|-\n| 2|| ''Second'' [Factor] \n|-\n|3|| ''Master'' [of a trading station]\n|-\n| 4|| ''Sloopmaster'' <br /> ''Surgeon'' \n|-\n| 5|| ''Writer'' \n|-\n|6|| ''Apprentice'' \n|-\n|||''' ''SERVANTS'' ''' \n|-\n|1|| ''Tradesman'' <br /> ''Steersman'' \n|-\n|2|| ''Canoeman'' <br /> ''Bowsman'' \n|-\n|3|| ''Middleman''\n|-\n|4|| ''Labourer''  \n|}\n\n;Hierarchical order 1821\u20131871<ref name=\"Judd\"/><ref>Tach\u00e9, Alexandre Antonin & Cameron, Donald Roderick (1870).

The Bostonians agreed on the plan's merits but their speculative voyage in 1663 failed when their ship ran into [[Sea ice|pack ice]] in [[Hudson Strait]].

Inland posts [[Asleep by the frozen sea|were not built]] until 1774.

By adoption of the Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the \"[[Made Beaver]]\" (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents.

They established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages, and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region, learning their languages and often forming alliances through marriages with indigenous women. In March 1686, the French sent a [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)|raiding party]] under the [[Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes|Chevalier des Troyes]] more than {{convert|1300|km|abbr=on}} to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to strategic deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France [[King William's War|were officially at war]], and the conflict played out in North America as well. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory. In 1693 the HBC [[Battle of Fort Albany (1693)|recovered Fort Albany]]; d'Iberville [[Capture of York Factory|captured York Factory]] in 1694, but the company recovered it the next year.<ref name=\"Company of Adventurers\">{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Peter C.|title=Company of Adventurers|date=1986|publisher=Penguin Books Canada|location=Markham, Ont.|isbn=978-0140067200|edition=New}}</ref>{{rp|151\u2013158}}\n\nIn 1697, d'Iberville again commanded a French naval raid on York Factory. On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Hudson's Bay]] (5 September 1697), the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by laying siege to the fort and pretending to be a much larger army. The French retained all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713. (A small French and Indian force attacked Fort Albany again [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|in 1709]] during [[Queen Anne's War]] but was unsuccessful.

Sayer, a [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] trapper and trader, was accused of illegal trading in furs. The Court of [[Assiniboia]] brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed M\u00e9tis men led by [[Louis Riel, Sr.]] gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge [[Adam Thom]] did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, ''Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!'' (\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\"), the M\u00e9tis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother factor was the findings of the [[Palliser Expedition]] of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain [[John Palliser]]. He surveyed the area of the prairies and wilderness from Lake Superior to the southern passes of the Rocky Mountains.

It ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company: that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1863, the [[International Financial Society]] bought controlling interest in the HBC, signalling a shift in the company's outlook: most of the new shareholders were less interested in the fur trade than in real estate speculation and economic development in the West. The Society floated \u00a32 million in public shares on non-ceded land held ostensibly by the Hudson's Bay Company as an asset and leveraged this asset for collateral for these funds. These funds allowed the Society the financial means to weather the financial collapse of 1866 which destroyed many competitors and invest in railways in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb50-udfs|title=Records of the International Finance Society|work=Archives Hub|publisher=[[Jisc]]|accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SketchesGrizzly.jpeg|thumb|left|''A rough and tumble with a [[grizzly]]'' (Harry Bullock-Webster)]]\n\nIn 1869, after rejecting the American government offer of {{CAD|10,000,000}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405101925/http://www.canadahistory.com/sections/Politics/pm/johnmacdonald.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2007 |title=John A.

Saw several cases at Godhavn, Etah, Port Burwell, Arctic Bay\"; that \"an epidemic resembling influenza killed a considerable proportion of population at Port Burwell\"; and that \"the gravest danger faces the Eskimo in his transfer from a race-long hunter to a dependent trapper. White flour, sea-biscuits, tea and tobacco do not provide sufficient fuel to warm and nourish him\". Furthermore, he discouraged the establishment of an Arctic hospital. The \"proposed hospital at Pangnirtung would be a waste of money, as it could be reached by only a few natives\". Banting's report contrasted starkly with the bland descriptions provided by the ship's physician, F. H. Stringer.</blockquote>\n\n====Retail expansion====\n[[File:HBC Logo.svg|thumb|HBC's coat of arms logo]]\n\nIn 1960, the company acquired [[Morgan's]] allowing it to expand into Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa.

The company granted public access to the collection the following year.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 27 January 1994, the company's archives were formally donated to the Archives of Manitoba.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBCA History |website=Hudson's Bay Company Archives |publisher=Government of Manitoba |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |access-date=6 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925004135/http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/archives/hbca/about/hbca_history.html |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the donation, the appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBC Archive as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs.<ref>{{cite web |title=HBC History Foundation |website=Hudson's Bay Company |url=http://www3.hbc.com/hbc/socialresponsibility/hbc-history-foundation/ |access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> More than {{convert|2|km|spell=in}} of filed documents and hundreds of microfilm reels are now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 2007, Hudson's Bay Company Archives became part of the United Nations \"[[Memory of the World Programme]]\" project, under [[UNESCO]].

This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants.  Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts.  They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records.  In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods.  These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. [[Made Beaver|Made-Beaver]], the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |first2=Frank D. |last2=Lewis |title=Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of Hudson's Bay Company, 1700\u20131763 |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=465\u2013494 |date=September 1993 |jstor=2122402 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700013450}}</ref><ref name=\"Judd\">{{cite journal |last=Judd |first=Carol |title=Native labour and social stratification in Hudson's Bay Company's Northern Department, 1770\u20131870 |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=305\u2013314 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x }}</ref>\n\n;Hierarchichal order pre-1821<ref name=\"Judd\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"50\" | #\n! align=\"center\" width=\"360\" | Job Title\n|-\n|||''' ''OFFICERS'' ''' \n|-\n| 1 || ''Chief Factor'' \n|-\n| 2|| ''Second'' [Factor] \n|-\n|3|| ''Master'' [of a trading station]\n|-\n| 4|| ''Sloopmaster'' <br /> ''Surgeon'' \n|-\n| 5|| ''Writer'' \n|-\n|6|| ''Apprentice'' \n|-\n|||''' ''SERVANTS'' ''' \n|-\n|1|| ''Tradesman'' <br /> ''Steersman'' \n|-\n|2|| ''Canoeman'' <br /> ''Bowsman'' \n|-\n|3|| ''Middleman''\n|-\n|4|| ''Labourer''  \n|}\n\n;Hierarchical order 1821\u20131871<ref name=\"Judd\"/><ref>Tach\u00e9, Alexandre Antonin & Cameron, Donald Roderick (1870).
