As the [[United States]]' busiest immigrant inspection station from 1892 to 1954, approximately 12 million immigrants arriving at the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] were processed there under federal law. Today, it is part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], accessible to the public only by ferry. The north side of the island is the site of the main building and support structures that once served as the headquarters of the U.S. Bureau of Immigration for New York Harbor; it now hosts a national museum of immigration. The south side of the island, including the [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital]], is only open to the public through guided tours.\n\nIn the 19th century, Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson, a component of the fortifications of New York Harbor. It later became a [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|naval magazine]] for storing artillery. The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897. The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines as well as processing immigrants. After 1924, Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center. During both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] its facilities were also used by the United States military to detain prisoners of war. Following the immigration station's closure, the buildings languished for several years until they partially reopened in 1976. The main building and adjacent structures were completely renovated in 1990.\n\nThe {{convert|27.5|acre|ha|abbr=|adj=on}} island was greatly expanded by [[land reclamation]] between the late 1890s and the 1930s. Jurisdictional disputes between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] persisted until 1998, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[New Jersey v. New York]]'' that the {{convert|4.68|acre}} that comprise the original island and its environs are part of New York and that almost all of the reclaimed land is part of New Jersey.\n\n==Geography and access==\nEllis Island is in [[Upper New York Bay]] within [[New York Harbor]], east of [[Liberty State Park]] and north of [[Liberty Island]]. While most of the island is in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], a small section is an [[exclave]] of [[New York City]].<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Hagstrom Map Company, Inc|isbn=978-0-88097-763-0|title=Hudson County New Jersey Street Map|year=2010}}</ref><ref name=\"ERIS\">{{cite journal|first=Richard G.|last=Castagna|first2=Lawrence L.|last2=Thornton|first3=John M.|last3=Tyrawski|title=GIS and Coastal Boundary Disputes: Where is Ellis Island?|publisher=ESRI|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap138/p138.htm|accessdate=November 17, 2013|quote=The New York portion of Ellis Island is landlocked, enclaved within New Jersey's territory.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018003341/http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap138/p138.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> The island has a land area of {{convert|27.5|acre|ha}}, much of which is from [[land reclamation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/ellis-island-history|title=Ellis Island History - The Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island|website=www.libertyellisfoundation.org|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> The natural island and contiguous areas comprise {{convert|4.68|acre}} within New York, and are located on the northern portion of the present-day island.<ref name=\"ERIS\"/> The artificial land is part of New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|first=Joan|last=Biskupic|title=N.J.

As the [[United States]]' busiest immigrant inspection station from 1892 to 1954, approximately 12 million immigrants arriving at the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] were processed there under federal law. Today, it is part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], accessible to the public only by ferry. The north side of the island is the site of the main building and support structures that once served as the headquarters of the U.S. Bureau of Immigration for New York Harbor; it now hosts a national museum of immigration. The south side of the island, including the [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital]], is only open to the public through guided tours.\n\nIn the 19th century, Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson, a component of the fortifications of New York Harbor. It later became a [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|naval magazine]] for storing artillery. The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897. The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines as well as processing immigrants. After 1924, Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center. During both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] its facilities were also used by the United States military to detain prisoners of war. Following the immigration station's closure, the buildings languished for several years until they partially reopened in 1976. The main building and adjacent structures were completely renovated in 1990.\n\nThe {{convert|27.5|acre|ha|abbr=|adj=on}} island was greatly expanded by [[land reclamation]] between the late 1890s and the 1930s. Jurisdictional disputes between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] persisted until 1998, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[New Jersey v. New York]]'' that the {{convert|4.68|acre}} that comprise the original island and its environs are part of New York and that almost all of the reclaimed land is part of New Jersey.\n\n==Geography and access==\nEllis Island is in [[Upper New York Bay]] within [[New York Harbor]], east of [[Liberty State Park]] and north of [[Liberty Island]]. While most of the island is in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], a small section is an [[exclave]] of [[New York City]].<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Hagstrom Map Company, Inc|isbn=978-0-88097-763-0|title=Hudson County New Jersey Street Map|year=2010}}</ref><ref name=\"ERIS\">{{cite journal|first=Richard G.|last=Castagna|first2=Lawrence L.|last2=Thornton|first3=John M.|last3=Tyrawski|title=GIS and Coastal Boundary Disputes: Where is Ellis Island?|publisher=ESRI|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap138/p138.htm|accessdate=November 17, 2013|quote=The New York portion of Ellis Island is landlocked, enclaved within New Jersey's territory.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018003341/http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap138/p138.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> The island has a land area of {{convert|27.5|acre|ha}}, much of which is from [[land reclamation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/ellis-island-history|title=Ellis Island History - The Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island|website=www.libertyellisfoundation.org|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> The natural island and contiguous areas comprise {{convert|4.68|acre}} within New York, and are located on the northern portion of the present-day island.<ref name=\"ERIS\"/> The artificial land is part of New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|first=Joan|last=Biskupic|title=N.J.

The 17th as part of Birney's Division was pushed forward to occupy the stone wall at the western edge of the Wheat Field abutting the woods there. Only the intervention of the V Corps saved the II Corps from annihilation. 17th Maine saw hot and heavy action being attacked from two sides.
