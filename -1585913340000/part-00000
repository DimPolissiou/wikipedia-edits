In 1939 he was wounded by an RAF tail gunner and blinded in one eye. After his recovery he chose to return to active service but was shot down again in France and was seriously injured. These injuries kept him grounded for the next two years. In 1942 he returned to active duty with 1st Fighter Wing (''[[Jagdgeschwader 1 Oesau]]''; ''JG'' 1). He was then made Group Commander (''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'') of II Group of [[JG 11]] (II./JG 11) and promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]''. He was appointed as [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'') of JG 11 and was listed as [[missing in action]] during the attack on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bases at [[Asch Airfield|Asch]] and [[Ophoven Airfield|Ophoven]] as part of [[Operation Bodenplatte]]. He was posthumously promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] ({{lang-de|[[Oberstleutnant]]}}) and was recommended for the Oak Leaves ({{lang-de|Eichenlaub}}) to the Knight's Cross, which was never actioned amongst all the confusion in the last months of the war.\n\nSpecht was considered as one of the best fighter leaders during the war and was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. During his combat career he was credited with 34 enemy aircraft destroyed, all downed on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. He was shot down six times during the war. \n\n==Personality==\nSpecht was born on 13 November 1914 in Frankenstein (modern [[Z\u0105bkowice \u015al\u0105skie]]) of [[Prussia]] (modern [[Poland]]). Specht was short in stature but full of energy. He had a distinguishing patch of gray in his hair just above his forehead. He was a perfectionist with a high sense of duty, and expected his men to follow his high standards. Although he lost his left eye in late 1939, according to [[Squadron Leader]] ({{lang-de|[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]}}) [[Heinz Knoke]] of 5./JG 11, he could see like a vulture and was an excellent marksman.<ref name = Weal.99.54>Weal (1999a), p. 54, 101</ref> Specht also had an eye for detail, and he wrote detailed [[Debriefing#Military debriefing|mission log]] reports for future use.<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = Zorner.07.125/><ref name=Obermaier.86>Obermaier (1986)</ref>\n\nSpecht's personal emblems adorning his aircraft included a design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] (termed a winged pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries.<ref name = weal.99.54>Weal (1999a), pp. 54, 101</ref> His single-engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross painted on the cowling after he was awarded the honour in April 1944.<ref name = Wealb.99.93>Weal (1999b), p. 93</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.70/>\n\nSpecht would not allow women on the group base, considering them an unnecessary diversion. According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife came to visit him on the II./JG 11 base but was held at the guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would have time for her only after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the [[Victory in Europe Day|war in Europe came to an end]].<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = Zorner.07.125/>\n\n===Formation leadership===\nAfter taking command of II./JG 11, Specht led the group on every mission in which it participated. Following each mission, he wrote detailed and analytical mission reports. He soon gained a reputation as one of the most reliable formation leaders, with II./JG 11 reputed to be one of the best units among the fighter force ({{lang-de|[[jagdwaffe]]}}) on Reich air defense ({{lang-de|Reichsluftverteidigung}}).<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.26/>\n\nOn 17 August 1943 Specht led the group from [[Gilze en Rijen]] on an intercept and sighted the  [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] of [[381st Training Group|381 Bombing Group]] near [[Antwerp]]. He waited for 30 minutes until the [[Escort fighter|escorts]] turned back at [[Eupen]] before attacking. Within the next half hour, sixty percent of the bombers went down. Specht himself was credited with downing two as his 16th and 17th victories.<ref name = Wealb.99.36>Weal (1999b), p. 36</ref>\n\nOn 11 September 1944 Specht and the JG 11 Headquarters-flight ({{lang-de|Stabsschwarm}}) led a combined formation of II./[[JG 4]] (Sturm) ({{lang-de|Sturmgruppen}}) and III./JG 4. Due to Specht's skills, they positioned themselves against thirty-four B-17s of the [[100th Air Refueling Wing|\"Bloody 100th\"]] and fifteen B-17s were downed before the escorting P-51s arrived. Specht was credited with one P-51.<ref name=Caldwell.07.233>Caldwell & Mulller (2007), p. 233</ref><ref name = Aces>Aces of the Luftwaffe website.</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0211-22, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|alt=twin engine aircraft with a shark's mouth painted on the nose|A Bf 110 similar to one flown by Specht. Notice the shark's mouth painted on the nose]]\n\nHaving joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1935 and completed his pilot training, when war started in September 1939 Specht was a ''Leutnant'' in 3./ZG 26 \"''Horst Wessel''\" (the 3rd squadron of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing). Supposedly equipped with the new, twin-engine, [[Bf 110]] heavy fighter, its production was so far behind schedule that 7 of the 10 ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppen'' (including Specht's I./ZG 26) had to be equipped with old [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]C and D single-engined fighters. They thus took no role in the Polish campaign, instead based on the North Sea coast near [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\nThis was virtually the only part of the Western Front, during the [[Phoney War]], where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two [[Handley Page Hampden]] [[medium bomber]]s in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near [[Heligoland]], shot down on 29 September.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = weal.99.37>Weal (1999a), p. 36-37</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.3678>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 36, 78</ref><ref name = weal.96.21>Weal (1996a), pp. 20\u201321</ref> Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next ''Gruppe'' selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.\n\nOn 3 December 1939, 24 RAF [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from [[RAF Marham|Marham]] and [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]] bases attacked Heligoland. These were intercepted by I./ZG 26 along with other Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. Specht scored his third victory, shooting down a bomber over the [[North Sea]]. But he was also hit by return fire from the Wellington's [[tail gunner]], seriously wounding him in the face. [[Ditching]] into the sea, he was picked up by rescue craft. Losing the sight in his left eye, he spent the next six months in recovery.<ref name = weal.99.101>Weal (1999b), p. 101</ref> He was shot down by [[Corporal]] Copley of [[No. 38 Squadron RAF]].<ref>Holmes (2010), p. 32.</ref>\n\nHowever, he returned to active service, as ''Gruppe'' Adjutant of I./ZG 26. Still able to fly combat missions, his aircraft sported a pencil under his Adjutant's chevron \u2013 bemoaning the combat pilot's universal loathing of paperwork! <ref name=\"weal.99.54\"/> During the French campaign, on 23 May 1940, Spitfires were encountered by Bf 110s and Bf 109s for the first time. The engagement resulted in the loss of two Bf 110s and two Bf 109s. However, Specht would claim three RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters shot down. The British [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]] involved lost three Spitfires in the entire engagement. [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell|Roger J Bushell]] became a [[prisoner of war]] while Paul H. Klipsch and Patrick Alexander George Learmond were [[killed in action]].<ref name=\"epibreren\">Droog, Bart. \n[http://www.epibreren.com/ww2/raf/92_squadron.html \"RAF - No. 92 Squadron.\"] ''Traces of World War 2'' 23 January 2008. Retrieved: 20 September 2010.</ref> During the course of this battle, Specht and his rear gunner/radio operator were wounded, [[forced landing|force land]] near [[Calais]] and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] with a damaged aircraft.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = weal.99.37>Weal (1999a), p. 36-37</ref><ref name=\"Caldwell.07.3678\"/> Again he was badly injured and spent further time in hospital.\n\nAfter recovering he took up staff duties for a year, until 16 September 1941, when he was made ''Staffelkapit\u00e4n'' (Squadron leader) of a newly formed night-fighter training unit, ''2./Nachtjagdschule 1'' (coming out of 2./Zerst\u00f6rerschule 1). Soon after, on 31 October, ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) Specht was promoted to ''Kommandeur'' of III./NJS 1. Located at [[Ingolstadt Manching Airport|Ingolstadt-Manching]], Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting. [[Paul Zorner]], a future night fighter expert, was one of his students. Leading the ''Gruppe'' for exactly one year, this was the last time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft, whereupon he returned to combat duties.<ref name = Zorner.07.125>Zorner (2007), pp. 125\u2013139</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-398-1794-18, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109 G-2.jpg|thumb|alt=single engine aircraft parked in a field|A Bf 109 ''Gustav'' similar to one used by Specht]]\n\nInitially reassigned to 10./JG 1 based in the Ruhr, he shot down his first ''Viermot'' (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name=\"Michaelholm97\">Holm (1997\u20132003)</ref> This was the beginning of a new war for Specht \u2013 the 8th [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich's industrial complex. Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed ''StaKa'' of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to ''Kommandeur'' of II/JG 11. ''Jagdgeschwader 11'' was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|Jagdgeschwader 1]] (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new ''Gruppen'' flying Bf 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection.<ref name = Caldwell.07.91>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 91</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.26>Weal (2006), p. 26</ref><ref name=\"Aces\"/> He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit the first line of defense against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.\n\nThroughout 1943, as the Luftwaffe took the fight to the bombers flying unescorted over the Reich, Specht scored regularly. Leading by example, he soon became one of the top ''Viermot'' aces shooting down 14 bombers out of his 18 victories that year.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = Wealb.99.51>Weal (1999b), p. 54</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.124>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 124,184</ref> This included his 13th victory on 26 July, during [[Blitz Week]], when bombers targeted the [[Blohm & Voss]] [[Submarine pen|U Boat yards]] in [[Hamburg]] and the [[synthetic rubber]] factories of [[Continental AG]] and Nordhafen in [[Hanover]].;<ref name=\"Aces\"/> as well a pair on 17 August on the infamous Schweinfurt raid. He was awarded the ''Ehrenpokal'' (Goblet of Honour) on 23 August, and the German Cross in Gold on 25 November. Specht became increasingly critical of the relatively weak [[armament]] of the Bf 109 during this time. Towards the end of 1943, with longer-ranged fighter-escorts accompanying the Allied bombers, tactics had to change: The single-engined fighters would engage the fighter screen while a ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppe'' would take on the bombers. Coincidentally, for a while Specht's II./JG 11 was paired up with his old unit, I./ZG 26.<ref>Forsyth (2011), p66.</ref>\n\nHe continued his success into 1944: On 11 February 1944 II./JG 11 engaged escort fighters returning from a raid on [[Frankfurt]] with Specht downing [[2nd Lieutenant]] Richard McDonald of the [[354th Fighter Group]], who crashed his [[P-51 Mustang]] \"Plane Jane\" near [[Oberalben]].<ref>Reardon (14 July 1997), The Patriot Ledger</ref> Nine days later, (the opening of the 8th USAAF's \"Big Week\") Specht had to [[Emergency landing|crash land]] on the [[\u00c6r\u00f8]] Island as a result of technical problems with his Bf 109G. Despite that, he was back in the air the next day claiming a P-47 fighter, and a bomber and a fighter the day after, to take his tally to 30. On 15 March II./JG 11 lost six killed in action, two wounded, and eight aircraft lost, resulting in Specht declaring the unit non-operational for six weeks to rest and replace losses.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = Wealb.99.51>Weal (1999b), p. 54</ref><ref name=\"Caldwell.07.124\"/>\n\nOn 8 April 1944 Specht was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his 30 victories on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. On 15 April after his commander, [[Hermann Graf]] was injured, he gave up his command of II./JG 11, and moved to the ''Geschwaderstab'' (Wing Command flight) as Kommodore-in-training, under [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. Promoted to major on 1 May, he was given full command of JG 11 on 15 May, replacing Ihlefeld who was himself transferred to command JG 1. But little could be done as the Allied bombing offensive stepped up a gear. His units were decimated over the skies of Normandy in June and July. He himself was injured in July, suffering head injuries in yet another crash-landing. Despite severe pain from his injuries, Specht remained on combat duty. His wing was retired to the Rhineland to be rebuilt, but they were crushed again in the latter half of 1944. The Allies were now sending overwhelming numbers of bombers to destroy the German industrial and military factories and the bombers were now protected by the advent of the P-51 Mustang, providing fighter cover right into the heart of the Reich and back.\n\nDuring [[Operation Market Garden]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[parachute]] landings in the [[Netherlands]], JG 11 was credited with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]]s near [[Deventer]].<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.70>Weal (2006), pp. 70\u201371</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.184>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 184</ref><ref name = WW2Awards>Gunther Specht on World War 2 Awards</ref> According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to ''flak'' and one in aerial combat against ''[[Jagdgeschwader 53]]'' Bf 109s near [[Apeldoorn]]. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer.<ref>Franks (2000), p. 101.</ref> However, it may be the case that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.<ref>Franks (2000). p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Operation Bodenplatte===\n{{Main|Operation Bodenplatte}}\n[[File:Fw 190 A-8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Fw 190 A-8/R2 in American hands. This Fw 190 was captured during ''Bodenplatte''. Specht flew an Fw 190A on this date.]]\nIn December, Hitler ordered his final, desperate attack in the west - through the snow-covered forests of the Ardennes. Poor weather kept the promised air support grounded, but early on the morning of New Year's Day, long after it was tactically useful or relevant, the Luftwaffe launched Operation ''Bodenplatte'' ('Baseplate') - not against the devastating strategic bombers, but on the frontline fighter airbases.\n\nVirtually all available fighter groups in the west were allocated to this mission, JG 11 was assigned the USAAF airfield at [[Asch Airfield|Asch]] (Code Name Y\u201329) and the RAF airfield at [[Ophoven Airfield|Ophoven]] north of Asch. The [[366th Fighter Group]] (366th FG, [[Ninth Air Force]]) and the [[352d Fighter Group|352nd Fighter Group]] (352 FG, [[Eighth Air Force]]) were based at Asch. [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|No. 41]], [[No. 130 Squadron RAF|No. 130]], [[350th Squadron (Belgium)|350]] and [[No. 610 Squadron RAF|No. 610]] [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]]s of the [[2nd Tactical Wing]] were based at Ophoven.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name = Parker.98.385>Parker (1998), pp. 383, 385\u2013391</ref>\n\nFor this mission Specht wore his full dress uniform with medals instead of his flight suit. JG 11 was based at [[Griesheim (Hesse)|Darmstadt-Griesheim]], [[Mainhausen|Zellhausen]], and [[Grossostheim|Gross-Ostheim]]. I./JG 11, III./JG 11 (Fw 190 A\u20139), and II./JG 11 (Bf 109G) mustered sixty-five aircraft for this mission. Specht flew Fw 190 A-9 (Wk. Nr. 205033) \"Black 4\". Overall the operation was a major failure. With the large proportion of inexperienced, green pilots, flight coordination was extremely difficult and due to the extreme secrecy many pilots were shot down by their own FlaK antiaircraft, who were not pre-warned of the operation. It also resulted in the loss of a number of irreplaceable combat leaders.\n\nAs regards JG 11 specifically, at 8:08 am{{ref label|Note3|c|c}} the aircraft took off and assembled over [[Aschaffenburg]] with two [[Junkers Ju 188]] 'Pathfinders' to navigate. After assembling, Specht ordered all aircraft to fly at {{convert|400|ft}} to the target area, climbing to {{convert|1500|ft}} prior to commencing the attack. Some [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s of the [[390th Fighter Squadron]], 366th FG, were already airborne and Mustangs of the [[487th Fighter Squadron]], 352nd FG, were on the runway. The formation was disrupted by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]], and several German aircraft were shot down.{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}<ref name = Zorner.07.125/><ref name = Parker.98.385/>\n\nThe P-47 and P-51s took a heavy toll of JG 11; some 25 pilots were lost, including Specht, who was posted as Missing In Action, along with other senior officers of JG 11.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name = Caldwell.07.78>Caldwell & Muller, (2007) p. 78</ref><ref name=\"JohnWeal.06.84\">Weal (2006), p. 84</ref>\n\n===Death and subsequent confusion===\nThere was some confusion over the circumstance of Specht's death. Lt. Melvin Paisley and his [[wingman]] Flight Officer Dave Johnson were flying 366th FG P-47s; Johnson shot down two German fighters before his aircraft was heavily damaged from return fire. Bailing out, he landed in a field near Asch. A Bf 109 he had shot down had [[Belly landing|belly landed]] close by and Johnson rode a borrowed bicycle over to inspect it. The aircraft was intact but the pilot was dead. Johnson took the pilot's identification card and gun and rode back to base. The identification card identified the pilot as an ''Oberstleutnant'' (lieutenant colonel); however, the card actually belonged to ''Oberleutnant'' ({{lang-de|[[Oberleutnant]]}}) August Engel of ''8 Staffel''.<ref name=Parker98pp385387/>\n\nFurther research has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, and that he was a ''major'' at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.<ref name=Johnmanrho.04.148>Manrho & P\u00fctz (2004), pp. 148-149.</ref>\n\nSpecht was officially listed as missing in action over [[Maastricht]], but he has recently been confirmed dead. He crashed his plane after taking heavy fire. Specht was promoted posthumously to ''Oberstleutnant''  and nominated for the ''Eichenlaub'' (Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross) though this was never awarded in the bedlam of the final weeks of the war. Shot down six times in his career, he preferred to ride the plane to a landing rather than taking to his parachute.

January 1945) was a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace]] during [[World War II]].\n\nHaving joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1935 and completed his pilot training, at the start of the war Specht was a ''Leutnant'' in 3./ZG 26 \"''Horst Wessel''\" (the 3rd squadron of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing). In 1939 he was wounded by an RAF tail gunner and blinded in one eye. He returned to active duty and was shot down six times during the war. After his recovery in 1939, he chose to return to active service but was shot down again in France and was seriously injured. These injuries kept him grounded for the next two years. In 1942 he returned to active duty with 1st Fighter Wing (''[[Jagdgeschwader 1 Oesau]]''; ''JG'' 1). He was then made Group Commander (''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'') of II Group of [[JG 11]] (II./JG 11) and promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]''. He was appointed as [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] (''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'') of JG 11 and was listed as [[missing in action]] during the attack on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bases at [[Asch Airfield|Asch]] and [[Ophoven Airfield|Ophoven]] as part of [[Operation Bodenplatte]]. He was posthumously promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] ({{lang-de|[[Oberstleutnant]]}}) and was recommended for the Oak Leaves ({{lang-de|Eichenlaub}}) to the Knight's Cross, which was never actioned amongst all the confusion in the last months of the war.\n\nSpecht was considered as one of the best fighter leaders during the war and was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. During his combat career he was credited with 34 enemy aircraft destroyed, all downed on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\n==Personality==\nSpecht was born on 13 November 1914 in Frankenstein (modern [[Z\u0105bkowice \u015al\u0105skie]]) of [[Prussia]] (modern [[Poland]]). Specht was short in stature but full of energy. He had a distinguishing patch of gray in his hair just above his forehead. He was a perfectionist with a high sense of duty, and expected his men to follow his high standards. Although he lost his left eye in late 1939, according to [[Squadron Leader]] ({{lang-de|[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]}}) [[Heinz Knoke]] of 5./JG 11, he could see like a vulture and was an excellent marksman.<ref name = Weal.99.54>Weal (1999a), p. 54, 101</ref> Specht also had an eye for detail, and he wrote detailed [[Debriefing#Military debriefing|mission log]] reports for future use.<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = Zorner.07.125/><ref name=Obermaier.86>Obermaier (1986)</ref>\n\nSpecht's personal emblems adorning his aircraft included a design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] (termed a winged pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries.<ref name = weal.99.54>Weal (1999a), pp. 54, 101</ref> His single-engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross painted on the cowling after he was awarded the honour in April 1944.<ref name = Wealb.99.93>Weal (1999b), p. 93</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.70/>\n\nSpecht would not allow women on the group base, considering them an unnecessary diversion. According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife came to visit him on the II./JG 11 base but was held at the guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would have time for her only after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the [[Victory in Europe Day|war in Europe came to an end]].<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = Zorner.07.125/>\n\n===Formation leadership===\nAfter taking command of II./JG 11, Specht led the group on every mission in which it participated. Following each mission, he wrote detailed and analytical mission reports. He soon gained a reputation as one of the most reliable formation leaders, with II./JG 11 reputed to be one of the best units among the fighter force ({{lang-de|[[jagdwaffe]]}}) on Reich air defense ({{lang-de|Reichsluftverteidigung}}).<ref name = Caldwell.07.91/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.26/>\n\nOn 17 August 1943 Specht led the group from [[Gilze en Rijen]] on an intercept and sighted the  [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]] of [[381st Training Group|381 Bombing Group]] near [[Antwerp]]. He waited for 30 minutes until the [[Escort fighter|escorts]] turned back at [[Eupen]] before attacking. Within the next half hour, sixty percent of the bombers went down. Specht himself was credited with downing two as his 16th and 17th victories.<ref name = Wealb.99.36>Weal (1999b), p. 36</ref>\n\nOn 11 September 1944 Specht and the JG 11 Headquarters-flight ({{lang-de|Stabsschwarm}}) led a combined formation of II./[[JG 4]] (Sturm) ({{lang-de|Sturmgruppen}}) and III./JG 4. Due to Specht's skills, they positioned themselves against thirty-four B-17s of the [[100th Air Refueling Wing|\"Bloody 100th\"]] and fifteen B-17s were downed before the escorting P-51s arrived. Specht was credited with one P-51.<ref name=Caldwell.07.233>Caldwell & Mulller (2007), p. 233</ref><ref name = Aces>Aces of the Luftwaffe website.</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0211-22, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|alt=twin engine aircraft with a shark's mouth painted on the nose|A Bf 110 similar to one flown by Specht. Notice the shark's mouth painted on the nose]]\n\nHaving joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1935 and completed his pilot training, when war started in September 1939 Specht was a ''Leutnant'' in 3./ZG 26 \"''Horst Wessel''\" (the 3rd squadron of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing). Supposedly equipped with the new, twin-engine, [[Bf 110]] heavy fighter, its production was so far behind schedule that 7 of the 10 ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppen'' (including Specht's I./ZG 26) had to be equipped with old [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]C and D single-engined fighters. They thus took no role in the Polish campaign, instead based on the North Sea coast near [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\nThis was virtually the only part of the Western Front, during the [[Phoney War]], where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two [[Handley Page Hampden]] [[medium bomber]]s in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near [[Heligoland]], shot down on 29 September.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = weal.99.37>Weal (1999a), p. 36-37</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.3678>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 36, 78</ref><ref name = weal.96.21>Weal (1996a), pp. 20\u201321</ref> Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next ''Gruppe'' selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.\n\nOn 3 December 1939, 24 RAF [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from [[RAF Marham|Marham]] and [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]] bases attacked Heligoland. These were intercepted by I./ZG 26 along with other Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. Specht scored his third victory, shooting down a bomber over the [[North Sea]]. But he was also hit by return fire from the Wellington's [[tail gunner]], seriously wounding him in the face. [[Ditching]] into the sea, he was picked up by rescue craft. Losing the sight in his left eye, he spent the next six months in recovery.<ref name = weal.99.101>Weal (1999b), p. 101</ref> He was shot down by [[Corporal]] Copley of [[No. 38 Squadron RAF]].<ref>Holmes (2010), p. 32.</ref>\n\nHowever, he returned to active service, as ''Gruppe'' Adjutant of I./ZG 26. Still able to fly combat missions, his aircraft sported a pencil under his Adjutant's chevron \u2013 bemoaning the combat pilot's universal loathing of paperwork! <ref name=\"weal.99.54\"/> During the French campaign, on 23 May 1940, Spitfires were encountered by Bf 110s and Bf 109s for the first time. The engagement resulted in the loss of two Bf 110s and two Bf 109s. However, Specht would claim three RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters shot down. The British [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]] involved lost three Spitfires in the entire engagement. [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell|Roger J Bushell]] became a [[prisoner of war]] while Paul H. Klipsch and Patrick Alexander George Learmond were [[killed in action]].<ref name=\"epibreren\">Droog, Bart. \n[http://www.epibreren.com/ww2/raf/92_squadron.html \"RAF - No. 92 Squadron.\"] ''Traces of World War 2'' 23 January 2008.

Soon after, on 31 October, ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) Specht was promoted to ''Kommandeur'' of III./NJS 1. Located at [[Ingolstadt Manching Airport|Ingolstadt-Manching]], Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting. [[Paul Zorner]], a future night fighter expert, was one of his students. Leading the ''Gruppe'' for exactly one year, this was the last time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft, whereupon he returned to combat duties.<ref name = Zorner.07.125>Zorner (2007), pp. 125\u2013139</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-398-1794-18, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 109 G-2.jpg|thumb|alt=single engine aircraft parked in a field|A Bf 109 ''Gustav'' similar to one used by Specht]]\n\nInitially reassigned to 10./JG 1 based in the Ruhr, he shot down his first ''Viermot'' (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name=\"Michaelholm97\">Holm (1997\u20132003)</ref> This was the beginning of a new war for Specht \u2013 the 8th [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich's industrial complex. Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed ''StaKa'' of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to ''Kommandeur'' of II/JG 11. ''Jagdgeschwader 11'' was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|Jagdgeschwader 1]] (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new ''Gruppen'' flying Bf 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection.<ref name = Caldwell.07.91>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 91</ref><ref name = JohnWeal.06.26>Weal (2006), p. 26</ref><ref name=\"Aces\"/> He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit the first line of defense against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.\n\nThroughout 1943, as the Luftwaffe took the fight to the bombers flying unescorted over the Reich, Specht scored regularly. Leading by example, he soon became one of the top ''Viermot'' aces shooting down 14 bombers out of his 18 victories that year.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = Wealb.99.51>Weal (1999b), p. 54</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.124>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 124,184</ref> This included his 13th victory on 26 July, during [[Blitz Week]], when bombers targeted the [[Blohm & Voss]] [[Submarine pen|U Boat yards]] in [[Hamburg]] and the [[synthetic rubber]] factories of [[Continental AG]] and Nordhafen in [[Hanover]].;<ref name=\"Aces\"/> as well a pair on 17 August on the infamous Schweinfurt raid. He was awarded the ''Ehrenpokal'' (Goblet of Honour) on 23 August, and the German Cross in Gold on 25 November. Specht became increasingly critical of the relatively weak [[armament]] of the Bf 109 during this time. Towards the end of 1943, with longer-ranged fighter-escorts accompanying the Allied bombers, tactics had to change: The single-engined fighters would engage the fighter screen while a ''Zerst\u00f6rergruppe'' would take on the bombers. Coincidentally, for a while Specht's II./JG 11 was paired up with his old unit, I./ZG 26.<ref>Forsyth (2011), p66.</ref>\n\nHe continued his success into 1944: On 11 February 1944 II./JG 11 engaged escort fighters returning from a raid on [[Frankfurt]] with Specht downing [[2nd Lieutenant]] Richard McDonald of the [[354th Fighter Group]], who crashed his [[P-51 Mustang]] \"Plane Jane\" near [[Oberalben]].<ref>Reardon (14 July 1997), The Patriot Ledger</ref> Nine days later, (the opening of the 8th USAAF's \"Big Week\") Specht had to [[Emergency landing|crash land]] on the [[\u00c6r\u00f8]] Island as a result of technical problems with his Bf 109G. Despite that, he was back in the air the next day claiming a P-47 fighter, and a bomber and a fighter the day after, to take his tally to 30. On 15 March II./JG 11 lost six killed in action, two wounded, and eight aircraft lost, resulting in Specht declaring the unit non-operational for six weeks to rest and replace losses.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = Wealb.99.51>Weal (1999b), p. 54</ref><ref name=\"Caldwell.07.124\"/>\n\nOn 8 April 1944 Specht was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his 30 victories on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. On 15 April after his commander, [[Hermann Graf]] was injured, he gave up his command of II./JG 11, and moved to the ''Geschwaderstab'' (Wing Command flight) as Kommodore-in-training, under [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. Promoted to major on 1 May, he was given full command of JG 11 on 15 May, replacing Ihlefeld who was himself transferred to command JG 1. But little could be done as the Allied bombing offensive stepped up a gear. His units were decimated over the skies of Normandy in June and July. He himself was injured in July, suffering head injuries in yet another crash-landing. Despite severe pain from his injuries, Specht remained on combat duty. His wing was retired to the Rhineland to be rebuilt, but they were crushed again in the latter half of 1944. The Allies were now sending overwhelming numbers of bombers to destroy the German industrial and military factories and the bombers were now protected by the advent of the P-51 Mustang, providing fighter cover right into the heart of the Reich and back.\n\nDuring [[Operation Market Garden]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[parachute]] landings in the [[Netherlands]], JG 11 was credited with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]]s near [[Deventer]].<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.70>Weal (2006), pp. 70\u201371</ref><ref name = Caldwell.07.184>Caldwell & Muller (2007), p. 184</ref><ref name = WW2Awards>Gunther Specht on World War 2 Awards</ref> According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to ''flak'' and one in aerial combat against ''[[Jagdgeschwader 53]]'' Bf 109s near [[Apeldoorn]]. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer.<ref>Franks (2000), p. 101.</ref> However, it may be the case that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.<ref>Franks (2000). p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Operation Bodenplatte===\n{{Main|Operation Bodenplatte}}\n[[File:Fw 190 A-8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Fw 190 A-8/R2 in American hands. This Fw 190 was captured during ''Bodenplatte''. Specht flew an Fw 190A on this date.]]\nIn December, Hitler ordered his final, desperate attack in the west - through the snow-covered forests of the Ardennes. Poor weather kept the promised air support grounded, but early on the morning of New Year's Day, long after it was tactically useful or relevant, the Luftwaffe launched Operation ''Bodenplatte'' ('Baseplate') - not against the devastating strategic bombers, but on the frontline fighter airbases.\n\nVirtually all available fighter groups in the west were allocated to this mission, JG 11 was assigned the USAAF airfield at [[Asch Airfield|Asch]] (Code Name Y\u201329) and the RAF airfield at [[Ophoven Airfield|Ophoven]] north of Asch. The [[366th Fighter Group]] (366th FG, [[Ninth Air Force]]) and the [[352d Fighter Group|352nd Fighter Group]] (352 FG, [[Eighth Air Force]]) were based at Asch. [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|No. 41]], [[No. 130 Squadron RAF|No. 130]], [[350th Squadron (Belgium)|350]] and [[No. 610 Squadron RAF|No. 610]] [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]]s of the [[2nd Tactical Wing]] were based at Ophoven.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name = Parker.98.385>Parker (1998), pp. 383, 385\u2013391</ref>\n\nFor this mission Specht wore his full dress uniform with medals instead of his flight suit. JG 11 was based at [[Griesheim (Hesse)|Darmstadt-Griesheim]], [[Mainhausen|Zellhausen]], and [[Grossostheim|Gross-Ostheim]]. I./JG 11, III./JG 11 (Fw 190 A\u20139), and II./JG 11 (Bf 109G) mustered sixty-five aircraft for this mission. Specht flew Fw 190 A-9 (Wk. Nr. 205033) \"Black 4\". Overall the operation was a major failure. With the large proportion of inexperienced, green pilots, flight coordination was extremely difficult and due to the extreme secrecy many pilots were shot down by their own FlaK antiaircraft, who were not pre-warned of the operation. It also resulted in the loss of a number of irreplaceable combat leaders.\n\nAs regards JG 11 specifically, at 8:08 am{{ref label|Note3|c|c}} the aircraft took off and assembled over [[Aschaffenburg]] with two [[Junkers Ju 188]] 'Pathfinders' to navigate. After assembling, Specht ordered all aircraft to fly at {{convert|400|ft}} to the target area, climbing to {{convert|1500|ft}} prior to commencing the attack. Some [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s of the [[390th Fighter Squadron]], 366th FG, were already airborne and Mustangs of the [[487th Fighter Squadron]], 352nd FG, were on the runway. The formation was disrupted by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]], and several German aircraft were shot down.{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}<ref name = Zorner.07.125/><ref name = Parker.98.385/>\n\nThe P-47 and P-51s took a heavy toll of JG 11; some 25 pilots were lost, including Specht, who was posted as Missing In Action, along with other senior officers of JG 11.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name = Caldwell.07.78>Caldwell & Muller, (2007) p. 78</ref><ref name=\"JohnWeal.06.84\">Weal (2006), p. 84</ref>\n\n===Death and subsequent confusion===\nThere was some confusion over the circumstance of Specht's death. Lt. Melvin Paisley and his [[wingman]] Flight Officer Dave Johnson were flying 366th FG P-47s; Johnson shot down two German fighters before his aircraft was heavily damaged from return fire. Bailing out, he landed in a field near Asch. A Bf 109 he had shot down had [[Belly landing|belly landed]] close by and Johnson rode a borrowed bicycle over to inspect it. The aircraft was intact but the pilot was dead. Johnson took the pilot's identification card and gun and rode back to base. The identification card identified the pilot as an ''Oberstleutnant'' (lieutenant colonel); however, the card actually belonged to ''Oberleutnant'' ({{lang-de|[[Oberleutnant]]}}) August Engel of ''8 Staffel''.<ref name=Parker98pp385387/>\n\nFurther research has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, and that he was a ''major'' at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.<ref name=Johnmanrho.04.148>Manrho & P\u00fctz (2004), pp. 148-149.</ref>\n\nSpecht was officially listed as missing in action over [[Maastricht]], but he has recently been confirmed dead. He crashed his plane after taking heavy fire. Specht was promoted posthumously to ''Oberstleutnant''  and nominated for the ''Eichenlaub'' (Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross) though this was never awarded in the bedlam of the final weeks of the war. Shot down six times in his career, he preferred to ride the plane to a landing rather than taking to his parachute. Specht was credited with 34 aerial victories, which included 15 ''Viermots'', all achieved over the Western Front.<ref name=Obermaier.86/><ref name = WW2Awards/><ref name=Caldwell.07.78/><ref name = JohnWeal.06.84>Weal (2006), p. 84</ref><ref name=Parker98pp385387>Parker (1998), pp. 385\u2013391.</ref><ref name=\"Johnmanrho.04.148\"/>{{ref label|Note1|b|b}}\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Awards===\n* [[Iron Cross]] in 1939 2nd and 1st Class.<ref name = WW2Awards/>\n* [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe]] on 23 August 1943 as ''Hauptmann'' and ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of II./JG 11.<ref>Obermaier (1989), p. 208.</ref>\n* [[German Cross]] in Gold on 25 November 1943 while serving in the II./JG 11.<ref>Patzwall & Scherzer (2001), p. 450.</ref>\n* [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 8 April 1944 as ''Major'' and ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of the II./JG 11.<ref>Scherzer (2001), p. 711.</ref>\n\n===Dates of rank===\n{| style=\"background: transparent;\"\n| August 1939: || ''[[Leutnant]]''<ref name=Obermaier.86/>\n|-\n| 23 May 1940: || ''[[Oberleutnant]]''<ref name=Obermaier.86/>\n|-\n| May 1943: || ''[[Hauptmann]]''<ref name=Obermaier.86/>\n|-\n| 8 April 1944: || ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'',<ref name=Obermaier.86/> (or possibly 1 May 1944<ref>Luftwaffe Officer Career Summaries website.</ref>)\n|-\n| 1 January 1945: || ''[[Oberstleutnant]]''.<ref name=Obermaier.86/>\n|}\n\n==Victories==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is a circular chapel, with an age estimated at 1000 years. Perhaps it was used only by aristocratic families that dominated the Or\u0103\u0219tie area and surroundings in the 11th century. Nearby there is a similar construction from the same period&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Geoagiu]] Rotunda.\n\n'''1105'''&nbsp;\u2013 In the wake of the [[First Crusade]] Anselm von Braz \u201dliber de liberis genitus\u201d, [[ch\u00e2telain]] of Logne, Walloon ministerial count settled here. The historian Karl Kurt Klein implies&nbsp;\u2013 though without proof&nbsp;\u2013 that he moved with his sons and descendants into the region where Or\u0103\u0219tie City is located today.\n\n'''1200'''&nbsp;\u2013 According to [[Transylvanian]] chronicles, this is the year in which construction of the city walls began. Subsequently, this was abandoned because of unfavorable conditions.\n\n'''1206'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]], mentioned Romos, a village near Or\u0103\u0219tie, as one of the first three villages in Transylvania comprising [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] colonists. The other two villages are Ighiu and Cric\u0103u.\n\n'''1224'''&nbsp;\u2013 Andrew II confirmed the privileges of the Saxon colonists and mentioned the existence of Romanian (''[[Vlachs|Blachi]]'') and [[Pecheneg]] (''Bisseni'') populations who lived in the forests surrounding the town. The settlement kept a number of privileges granted by the Hungarian royalty. The town was ruled by a royal judge (iudex regium), helped by 12 jurors chosen from local craftsmen and rich traders.\n\n'''1239'''&nbsp;\u2013 This is the probable founding year of the convent of the Or\u0103\u0219tie Franciscan church.\n\n'''1241'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie was devastated during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]]. A Mongolian [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] under the leadership of B\u00fcri entered [[Transylvania]] via the [[Olt Defile|Olt]] Valley, near [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219]], from the direction of [[Sibiu]], which was conquered on 11 April. One after another were devastated the Seats of [[Miercurea Sibiului]] (Ruzmargt), [[Sebe\u0219]] (M\u00fchlbach) and Or\u0103\u0219tie (Broos). The Mongolian army arrived [[Cenad]] on 25 April. Or\u0103\u0219tie was probably destroyed between 11 and 25 April. The Mongol devastation of the settlements and cities is vividly shown in the dramatic description of Alba-Iulia written by the Franciscan friar [[Rogerius of Apulia]]:\n<blockquote>\u201c ... I could not find anything except the bones and skulls of those who were killed, scattered and broken walls of churches and palaces that have been sprinkled by the blood of Christians.\u201d</blockquote>\nIn the future, King B\u00e9la IV would populate the region with new Saxon colonists and settlers.\n\n'''1309'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie had approx. 1,600 inhabitants. The Franciscan Order had been established in the city, and they built a church on the site of the current Franciscan friary.\n\n'''1324'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Hungarian King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I Robert]] announced that the settlement would be awarded the rank of town.\n\n'''1334'''&nbsp;\u2013 The priest John ''( Johannes Sacerdos )'', the tax collector in the Or\u0103\u0219tie region, performed a census by counting chimneys. Three hundred forty-four houses were numbered, a public bath, and four houses belonging to four nuns and the priest Nicholas ''(Nikolaus)''. This was the first time the presence of Saxons in the Pricaz village was mentioned. Also mentioned are two public schools belonging to the Saxons in the Or\u0103\u015ftie area.\n\n'''1344'''&nbsp;\u2013 Earliest mention was made of the patron \u201cSaint Nicolas\u201d of the Catholic Church from Or\u0103\u0219tie.\n\n'''1349'''&nbsp;\u2013 In a document issued at Sibiu, the Seat of Or\u0103\u0219tie ''(de sede Waras)'' was noted for the first time.\n\n'''1364'''&nbsp;\u2013 Saxons were settled in a colony near Or\u0103\u0219tie, in the C\u0103st\u0103u village.\n\n'''1367'''&nbsp;\u2013 A letter sent to the comes Christian of Or\u0103\u0219tie ''(de Warasyo)\" from Archeacon Ladislau of Ugosca is the oldest evidence for the functioning of a royal judge for the Seat of Or\u0103\u0219tie.\n\n'''1372'''&nbsp;\u2013 Comes Stephanus of Warasyo ''(\u0218tefan de Or\u0103\u0219tie)'' was named as representative of the Seven Saxon Seats in [[Transylvania]].\n\n'''1374'''&nbsp;\u2013 Chronicles named Count Mihai de Or\u0103\u0219tie (de Warasio) and the ruler of the region Mihai Blas de Or\u0103\u0219tie (Michael Blas von Broos).\n\n'''1376'''&nbsp;\u2013 Nineteen [[guild]]s (''fraternitas'') were mentioned as active in the town.\n\n'''1420'''&nbsp;\u2013 The county was raided by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. On 24 September 1420, a Turkish army invaded the south-east of [[Transylvania]] defeating, near [[Ha\u021beg]] County, an armed militia under the command of [[Transylvanian]] voivode [[Mikl\u00f3s Cs\u00e1ki]]. After two days the Turkish army looted and burned Or\u0103\u0219tie and its surroundings before retreating, taking several thousand prisoners as slaves.\n\n'''1425'''&nbsp;\u2013 Saxons from Or\u0103\u0219tie became suppliers for the Turks. The town was referred to by its German name, ''Bros'' or ''Broos''.\n\n'''1433'''&nbsp;\u2013 Registers of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] listed a few pilgrims from [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]] and [[Wallachia]]. Among them was Petru son of Blasius of Or\u0103\u0219tie (de Orastiia). The register stated that Peter, previously of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith (grecorum), was baptized on the day of Holy Trinity into the Catholic Church of Saint Peter in Rome, in the presence of John Sigismund, King of Hungary. It was also noted that Peter, as a soldier of his king, took part in several military actions against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and [[Bohemians]].\n\n'''1436'''&nbsp;\u2013 Hungarians were mentioned as living in the center of the town.\n\n'''1438'''&nbsp;\u2013 A Turkish army led by the sultan Murad II together with a Wallachian army under Vlad Dracula entered Transylvania, where they looted and spoiled Or\u0103\u0219tie and the Romos village. On this occasion the Franciscan friary was burned. Later the Franciscan order rebuilt it.\n\n'''1442'''&nbsp;\u2013 Another Turkish invasion of Transylvania led to a battle at S\u00e2ntimbru (18 March 1442), which ended with a Turkish victory under Mezid (Mezet) Bey of Vidin. The town was looted and burned.\n\n'''1449'''&nbsp;\u2013 Chronicles note the comes Bartholomew of Or\u0103\u0219tie attending a meeting of the Seven Seats.\n\n'''1479'''&nbsp;\u2013 A Turkish army entered [[Transylvania]] near C\u00e2lnic on 9 October, led by Ali Kodsha and Skender, or, according to some sources, by [[Ali Bey Mihalo\u011flu|Ali Michaloglu]] and Skander. Ottoman forces likely numbered 20000 soldiers, and 1000\u20132000 Wallachian infantrymen under Basarab cel T\u00e2n\u0103r-\u021aepelu\u0219. On 13 October Kodsha Bey set up camp in the [[Breadfield]], a place between \u0218ibot and Or\u0103\u0219tie.\nThe Hungarian army was led by [[P\u00e1l Kinizsi]], [[Istv\u00e1n B\u00e1thory]], Vuk Brankovi\u0107, and Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n. All forces combined totaled 12 or 15,000 men. The [[Battle of Breadfield]] took place in a location between Or\u0103\u0219tie and \u0218ibot. Turkish casualties were high, with several thousand killed, including a thousand Wallachian allies. The few Turks who survived fled into the mountains, where the majority were killed by the local population. In memory of this victory, Stephen Bathory raised a chapel near the village Aurel Vlaicu. When the Turks looted the city, they destroyed a large part of cultivated land, and the church inside the castle was damaged. Later, the church was rebuilt and taken into possession by the Hungarians. This is why, although the city was a Saxon fortress, the church became the property of reforming Hungarians and Saxons received only a room beside the church. This room was used as a place of worship until 1823 when a new church was built by Saxons.\n\n'''1486'''&nbsp;\u2013 Because of disagreements between the Seat of Or\u0103\u0219tie and Hunyad County, the Saxon University of Sibiu called in the Hungarian king [[Matthias Corvinus]] to regulate the borders between the two territories.\n\n'''1488'''&nbsp;\u2013 A population census of the Saxon Seats recorded population, mills, devastated properties, Catholics and Orthodox priests, and sometimes impoverished households. In Or\u0103\u0219tie (oppidi Brosz) were  recorded: 158 Saxons, 2 poor inhabitants, 4 shepherds, 1 miller and 10 abandoned households.\n\n'''1491'''&nbsp;\u2013 Saxons and Hungarians worked out an agreement that the function of Royal Judge be held alternately, and that each of the two nations should be represented in the Senate by equal numbers.\n\n'''1500'''&nbsp;\u2013 The annual fair on [[Saint Nicholas]] Day was held for the first time in history.\n\n'''1504'''&nbsp;\u2013 Stephen Olahus, father of the great humanist [[Nicolaus Olahus]], was appointed by the King as a judge of Or\u0103\u0219tie.\n\n'''1509'''&nbsp;\u2013 The presence of gypsies is first noted in Or\u0103\u0219tie: \"The ledger of Sibiu city notes a payment made to two employees sent to Or\u0103\u0219tie to escort some Gypsies who were held and accused of violent crimes in the market place in Or\u0103\u0219tie.\" In this year, Voivode J\u00e1nos Szapolyai moved population from Banat to Or\u0103\u0219tie and Turda\u0219 to bolster the region's decreasing population growth.\n\n'''1514'''&nbsp;\u2013 During the war led by Gheorghe Doja, J\u00e1nos Szapolyai\u2019s army passed through the region, and [[J\u00e1nos Szapolyai]] noted that the town was not sufficiently protected or equipmed for war.\n\n'''1520'''&nbsp;\u2013 25 April, at Buda, Louis II Hungary directed the Mayor of Sibiu to appoint the noble Matia Olah of Or\u0103\u0219tie (de Zazwaras) as Royal Judge of the town, a position then held by Matia's elderly father Stefan. The sovereign conferred along with this all revenues from taxation, and also other customary benefits.\n\n'''1529'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie was to make its oath of allegiance to the new King J\u00e1nos Szapolyai.\n\n'''1533'''&nbsp;\u2013 Following the expansion of Lutheranism in Or\u0103\u0219tie, the Franciscan Order was expelled.\n\n'''1536'''&nbsp;\u2013 On 4 June 1536 Matthew Olah, brother of  Nicolaus Olahus, archbishop of Strigoniu, died.\n\n'''1544'''&nbsp;\u2013 Orastie fortress was mentioned in chronicles by Sebastian M\u00fcnster.\n<blockquote>\u201c... and there is another strong fortress, below Sebe\u0219, near the town Or\u0103\u0219tie ...\u201d</blockquote>\n\n'''1550'''&nbsp;\u2013 The name Saxopolis appeared for the first time. Georg Reicherstorffer in \"Chorographia Transilvaniae\", printed in Vienna in 1550, wrote: <blockquote>\u201eOrastie city, which is called Broos by the Saxons, is located a mile away to the south of the grain fields. It is situated on the river Mure\u0219. The soil is unusually fertile, liberally yielding wheat, wine, and all kinds of fruits; the people are very tractable and in clothing style and diet are closer to the Romanians, who live broadly scattered in the desolate plains around.\u201d</blockquote>\n\n'''1560'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie Fortress is mentioned in chronicles by Giovanandrea Gromo. At about this time the ethnic Hungarian community converted to Protestantism and the Romanian Catholic Church became Reformed Calvinist.\n\n'''1599'''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Michael the Brave]] asked the town for a loan of 1,000 [[Guilder|florins]].\n\n'''1582'''&nbsp;\u2013 The ''Old Testament of Or\u0103\u0219tie'', one of the first Romanian-language translations of the Bible, was printed here with the help of the constable of Deva castle, Geszti Ferenc.\n\n'''1602'''&nbsp;\u2013 General [[Giorgio Basta]] garrisoned 400 [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] soldiers in the town. Their conduct caused the townsfolk to flee or otherwise barricade themselves in the church's castle. Later in the same year, general [[Gabriel Bethlen]], with an army of [[Tatars]], Turks, Hungarians and [[Serbs]] besieged the town. The Imperial soldiers were denied access to the church's castle, and all but eleven (11) were killed. In August, Basta retook Transylvania and hanged the Mayor of Or\u0103\u0219tie and two other prominent [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]].\n\n'''1604'''&nbsp;\u2013 Fifteen hundred of Basta's soldiers were garrisoned in the town. Extreme [[famine]] gave rise to [[cannibalism]].\n\n'''1605'''&nbsp;\u2013 A large part of the town was destroyed.\n\n'''1661'''&nbsp;\u2013 An Ottoman army in pursuit of [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|J\u00e1nos Kem\u00e9ny]] set fire to Or\u0103\u0219tie and [[Sebe\u0219]].\n\n'''1663'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Reformed College was established by [[Michael I Apafi]].\n\n'''1697'''&nbsp;\u2013 The first [[pharmacy]] of the town, \"Graffius\", was established.\n\n'''1733'''&nbsp;\u2013 The tax registry mentioned 2,800 inhabitants in 568 families: 240 Romanian families, 170 Hungarian, 100 Saxon, 50 [[Romani people|Gypsy]] and 8 [[Greeks|Greek]].\n\n'''1738'''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bubonic plague|plague]] caused the deaths of 156 people.\n\n'''1749'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Roman Catholic Church was built in its current form (a tower being added in 1880).\n\n'''1752\u20131756'''&nbsp;\u2013 One hundred forty-four colonists from [[Upper Austria]] settled in the town.\n\n'''1757\u20131758'''&nbsp;\u2013 Another 222 colonists arrived from the same region.\n\n'''1784'''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an|The peasants' rebellion of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an]] occurred.\n\n'''1820\u20131823'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church was built (a tower being added in 1841).\n\n'''1828'''&nbsp;\u2013 A large fire destroyed 127 houses.\n\n'''1848'''&nbsp;\u2013 Fighting was seen between Hungarian [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutionary]] forces under General [[J\u00f3zef Bem]] and the Austrian armies.\n\n'''1853'''&nbsp;\u2013 Transylvania was reorganised into 10 counties.

It is a circular chapel, with an age estimated at 1000 years. Perhaps it was used only by aristocratic families that dominated the Or\u0103\u0219tie area and surroundings in the 11th century. Nearby there is a similar construction from the same period&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Geoagiu]] Rotunda.\n\n'''1105'''&nbsp;\u2013 In the wake of the [[First Crusade]] Anselm von Braz \u201dliber de liberis genitus\u201d, [[ch\u00e2telain]] of Logne, Walloon ministerial count settled here. The historian Karl Kurt Klein implies&nbsp;\u2013 though without proof&nbsp;\u2013 that he moved with his sons and descendants into the region where Or\u0103\u0219tie City is located today.\n\n'''1200'''&nbsp;\u2013 According to [[Transylvanian]] chronicles, this is the year in which construction of the city walls began. Subsequently, this was abandoned because of unfavorable conditions.\n\n'''1206'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]], mentioned Romos, a village near Or\u0103\u0219tie, as one of the first three villages in Transylvania comprising [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] colonists. The other two villages are Ighiu and Cric\u0103u.\n\n'''1224'''&nbsp;\u2013 Andrew II confirmed the privileges of the Saxon colonists and mentioned the existence of Romanian (''[[Vlachs|Blachi]]'') and [[Pecheneg]] (''Bisseni'') populations who lived in the forests surrounding the town. The settlement kept a number of privileges granted by the Hungarian royalty. The town was ruled by a royal judge (iudex regium), helped by 12 jurors chosen from local craftsmen and rich traders.\n\n'''1239'''&nbsp;\u2013 This is the probable founding year of the convent of the Or\u0103\u0219tie Franciscan church.\n\n'''1241'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie was devastated during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]]. A Mongolian [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] under the leadership of B\u00fcri entered [[Transylvania]] via the [[Olt Defile|Olt]] Valley, near [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219]], from the direction of [[Sibiu]], which was conquered on 11 April. One after another were devastated the Seats of [[Miercurea Sibiului]] (Ruzmargt), [[Sebe\u0219]] (M\u00fchlbach) and Or\u0103\u0219tie (Broos). The Mongolian army arrived [[Cenad]] on 25 April. Or\u0103\u0219tie was probably destroyed between 11 and 25 April. The Mongol devastation of the settlements and cities is vividly shown in the dramatic description of Alba-Iulia written by the Franciscan friar [[Rogerius of Apulia]]:\n<blockquote>\u201c ... I could not find anything except the bones and skulls of those who were killed, scattered and broken walls of churches and palaces that have been sprinkled by the blood of Christians.\u201d</blockquote>\nIn the future, King B\u00e9la IV would populate the region with new Saxon colonists and settlers.\n\n'''1309'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie had approx. 1,600 inhabitants. The Franciscan Order had been established in the city, and they built a church on the site of the current Franciscan friary.\n\n'''1324'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Hungarian King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I Robert]] announced that the settlement would be awarded the rank of town.\n\n'''1334'''&nbsp;\u2013 The priest John ''( Johannes Sacerdos )'', the tax collector in the Or\u0103\u0219tie region, performed a census by counting chimneys. Three hundred forty-four houses were numbered, a public bath, and four houses belonging to four nuns and the priest Nicholas ''(Nikolaus)''. This was the first time the presence of Saxons in the Pricaz village was mentioned. Also mentioned are two public schools belonging to the Saxons in the Or\u0103\u015ftie area.\n\n'''1344'''&nbsp;\u2013 Earliest mention was made of the patron \u201cSaint Nicolas\u201d of the Catholic Church from Or\u0103\u0219tie.\n\n'''1349'''&nbsp;\u2013 In a document issued at Sibiu, the Seat of Or\u0103\u0219tie ''(de sede Waras)'' was noted for the first time.\n\n'''1364'''&nbsp;\u2013 Saxons were settled in a colony near Or\u0103\u0219tie, in the C\u0103st\u0103u village.\n\n'''1367'''&nbsp;\u2013 A letter sent to the comes Christian of Or\u0103\u0219tie ''(de Warasyo)\" from Archeacon Ladislau of Ugosca is the oldest evidence for the functioning of a royal judge for the Seat of Or\u0103\u0219tie.\n\n'''1372'''&nbsp;\u2013 Comes Stephanus of Warasyo ''(\u0218tefan de Or\u0103\u0219tie)'' was named as representative of the Seven Saxon Seats in [[Transylvania]].\n\n'''1374'''&nbsp;\u2013 Chronicles named Count Mihai de Or\u0103\u0219tie (de Warasio) and the ruler of the region Mihai Blas de Or\u0103\u0219tie (Michael Blas von Broos).\n\n'''1376'''&nbsp;\u2013 Nineteen [[guild]]s (''fraternitas'') were mentioned as active in the town.\n\n'''1420'''&nbsp;\u2013 The county was raided by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. On 24 September 1420, a Turkish army invaded the south-east of [[Transylvania]] defeating, near [[Ha\u021beg]] County, an armed militia under the command of [[Transylvanian]] voivode [[Mikl\u00f3s Cs\u00e1ki]]. After two days the Turkish army looted and burned Or\u0103\u0219tie and its surroundings before retreating, taking several thousand prisoners as slaves.\n\n'''1425'''&nbsp;\u2013 Saxons from Or\u0103\u0219tie became suppliers for the Turks. The town was referred to by its German name, ''Bros'' or ''Broos''.\n\n'''1433'''&nbsp;\u2013 Registers of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] listed a few pilgrims from [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]] and [[Wallachia]]. Among them was Petru son of Blasius of Or\u0103\u0219tie (de Orastiia). The register stated that Peter, previously of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith (grecorum), was baptized on the day of Holy Trinity into the Catholic Church of Saint Peter in Rome, in the presence of John Sigismund, King of Hungary. It was also noted that Peter, as a soldier of his king, took part in several military actions against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and [[Bohemians]].\n\n'''1436'''&nbsp;\u2013 Hungarians were mentioned as living in the center of the town.\n\n'''1438'''&nbsp;\u2013 A Turkish army led by the sultan Murad II together with a Wallachian army under Vlad Dracula entered Transylvania, where they looted and spoiled Or\u0103\u0219tie and the Romos village. On this occasion the Franciscan friary was burned. Later the Franciscan order rebuilt it.\n\n'''1442'''&nbsp;\u2013 Another Turkish invasion of Transylvania led to a battle at S\u00e2ntimbru (18 March 1442), which ended with a Turkish victory under Mezid (Mezet) Bey of Vidin. The town was looted and burned.\n\n'''1449'''&nbsp;\u2013 Chronicles note the comes Bartholomew of Or\u0103\u0219tie attending a meeting of the Seven Seats.\n\n'''1479'''&nbsp;\u2013 A Turkish army entered [[Transylvania]] near C\u00e2lnic on 9 October, led by Ali Kodsha and Skender, or, according to some sources, by [[Ali Bey Mihalo\u011flu|Ali Michaloglu]] and Skander. Ottoman forces likely numbered 20000 soldiers, and 1000\u20132000 Wallachian infantrymen under Basarab cel T\u00e2n\u0103r-\u021aepelu\u0219. On 13 October Kodsha Bey set up camp in the [[Breadfield]], a place between \u0218ibot and Or\u0103\u0219tie.\nThe Hungarian army was led by [[P\u00e1l Kinizsi]], [[Istv\u00e1n B\u00e1thory]], Vuk Brankovi\u0107, and Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n. All forces combined totaled 12 or 15,000 men. The [[Battle of Breadfield]] took place in a location between Or\u0103\u0219tie and \u0218ibot. Turkish casualties were high, with several thousand killed, including a thousand Wallachian allies. The few Turks who survived fled into the mountains, where the majority were killed by the local population. In memory of this victory, Stephen Bathory raised a chapel near the village Aurel Vlaicu. When the Turks looted the city, they destroyed a large part of cultivated land, and the church inside the castle was damaged. Later, the church was rebuilt and taken into possession by the Hungarians. This is why, although the city was a Saxon fortress, the church became the property of reforming Hungarians and Saxons received only a room beside the church. This room was used as a place of worship until 1823 when a new church was built by Saxons.\n\n'''1486'''&nbsp;\u2013 Because of disagreements between the Seat of Or\u0103\u0219tie and Hunyad County, the Saxon University of Sibiu called in the Hungarian king [[Matthias Corvinus]] to regulate the borders between the two territories.\n\n'''1488'''&nbsp;\u2013 A population census of the Saxon Seats recorded population, mills, devastated properties, Catholics and Orthodox priests, and sometimes impoverished households. In Or\u0103\u0219tie (oppidi Brosz) were  recorded: 158 Saxons, 2 poor inhabitants, 4 shepherds, 1 miller and 10 abandoned households.\n\n'''1491'''&nbsp;\u2013 Saxons and Hungarians worked out an agreement that the function of Royal Judge be held alternately, and that each of the two nations should be represented in the Senate by equal numbers.\n\n'''1500'''&nbsp;\u2013 The annual fair on [[Saint Nicholas]] Day was held for the first time in history.\n\n'''1504'''&nbsp;\u2013 Stephen Olahus, father of the great humanist [[Nicolaus Olahus]], was appointed by the King as a judge of Or\u0103\u0219tie.\n\n'''1509'''&nbsp;\u2013 The presence of gypsies is first noted in Or\u0103\u0219tie: \"The ledger of Sibiu city notes a payment made to two employees sent to Or\u0103\u0219tie to escort some Gypsies who were held and accused of violent crimes in the market place in Or\u0103\u0219tie.\" In this year, Voivode J\u00e1nos Szapolyai moved population from Banat to Or\u0103\u0219tie and Turda\u0219 to bolster the region's decreasing population growth.\n\n'''1514'''&nbsp;\u2013 During the war led by Gheorghe Doja, J\u00e1nos Szapolyai\u2019s army passed through the region, and [[J\u00e1nos Szapolyai]] noted that the town was not sufficiently protected or equipmed for war.\n\n'''1520'''&nbsp;\u2013 25 April, at Buda, Louis II Hungary directed the Mayor of Sibiu to appoint the noble Matia Olah of Or\u0103\u0219tie (de Zazwaras) as Royal Judge of the town, a position then held by Matia's elderly father Stefan. The sovereign conferred along with this all revenues from taxation, and also other customary benefits.\n\n'''1529'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie was to make its oath of allegiance to the new King J\u00e1nos Szapolyai.\n\n'''1533'''&nbsp;\u2013 Following the expansion of Lutheranism in Or\u0103\u0219tie, the Franciscan Order was expelled.\n\n'''1536'''&nbsp;\u2013 On 4 June 1536 Matthew Olah, brother of  Nicolaus Olahus, archbishop of Strigoniu, died.\n\n'''1544'''&nbsp;\u2013 Orastie fortress was mentioned in chronicles by Sebastian M\u00fcnster.\n<blockquote>\u201c... and there is another strong fortress, below Sebe\u0219, near the town Or\u0103\u0219tie ...\u201d</blockquote>\n\n'''1550'''&nbsp;\u2013 The name Saxopolis appeared for the first time. Georg Reicherstorffer in \"Chorographia Transilvaniae\", printed in Vienna in 1550, wrote: <blockquote>\u201eOrastie city, which is called Broos by the Saxons, is located a mile away to the south of the grain fields. It is situated on the river Mure\u0219. The soil is unusually fertile, liberally yielding wheat, wine, and all kinds of fruits; the people are very tractable and in clothing style and diet are closer to the Romanians, who live broadly scattered in the desolate plains around.\u201d</blockquote>\n\n'''1560'''&nbsp;\u2013 Or\u0103\u0219tie Fortress is mentioned in chronicles by Giovanandrea Gromo. At about this time the ethnic Hungarian community converted to Protestantism and the Romanian Catholic Church became Reformed Calvinist.\n\n'''1599'''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Michael the Brave]] asked the town for a loan of 1,000 [[Guilder|florins]].\n\n'''1582'''&nbsp;\u2013 The ''Old Testament of Or\u0103\u0219tie'', one of the first Romanian-language translations of the Bible, was printed here with the help of the constable of Deva castle, Geszti Ferenc.\n\n'''1602'''&nbsp;\u2013 General [[Giorgio Basta]] garrisoned 400 [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] soldiers in the town. Their conduct caused the townsfolk to flee or otherwise barricade themselves in the church's castle. Later in the same year, general [[Gabriel Bethlen]], with an army of [[Tatars]], Turks, Hungarians and [[Serbs]] besieged the town. The Imperial soldiers were denied access to the church's castle, and all but eleven (11) were killed. In August, Basta retook Transylvania and hanged the Mayor of Or\u0103\u0219tie and two other prominent [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]].\n\n'''1604'''&nbsp;\u2013 Fifteen hundred of Basta's soldiers were garrisoned in the town. Extreme [[famine]] gave rise to [[cannibalism]].\n\n'''1605'''&nbsp;\u2013 A large part of the town was destroyed.\n\n'''1661'''&nbsp;\u2013 An Ottoman army in pursuit of [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|J\u00e1nos Kem\u00e9ny]] set fire to Or\u0103\u0219tie and [[Sebe\u0219]].\n\n'''1663'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Reformed College was established by [[Michael I Apafi]].\n\n'''1697'''&nbsp;\u2013 The first [[pharmacy]] of the town, \"Graffius\", was established.\n\n'''1733'''&nbsp;\u2013 The tax registry mentioned 2,800 inhabitants in 568 families: 240 Romanian families, 170 Hungarian, 100 Saxon, 50 [[Romani people|Gypsy]] and 8 [[Greeks|Greek]].\n\n'''1738'''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bubonic plague|plague]] caused the deaths of 156 people.\n\n'''1749'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Roman Catholic Church was built in its current form (a tower being added in 1880).\n\n'''1752\u20131756'''&nbsp;\u2013 One hundred forty-four colonists from [[Upper Austria]] settled in the town.\n\n'''1757\u20131758'''&nbsp;\u2013 Another 222 colonists arrived from the same region.\n\n'''1784'''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Revolt of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an|The peasants' rebellion of Horea, Clo\u0219ca and Cri\u0219an]] occurred.\n\n'''1820\u20131823'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church was built (a tower being added in 1841).\n\n'''1828'''&nbsp;\u2013 A large fire destroyed 127 houses.\n\n'''1848'''&nbsp;\u2013 Fighting was seen between Hungarian [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutionary]] forces under General [[J\u00f3zef Bem]] and the Austrian armies.\n\n'''1853'''&nbsp;\u2013 Transylvania was reorganised into 10 counties.

It is the flagship property of [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]], which is owned by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], the multimedia arm of [[Philippines|Philippine-based]] telecommunications company [[PLDT]]. \n5 is also formally referred to as \"The ''Kapatid'' Network\", the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] term for \"sibling\", which was introduced in 2010.\n\nNamed after its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV]], which are carried in VHF Channel 5 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 51 (digital test broadcast; though the latter is licensed to TV5's sister company [[Cignal TV|Mediascape/Cignal TV]])  with channel 18 served as a permanent assigned digital frequency. 5 is also broadcasting to 7 other owned-and-operated stations, and 19 affiliated television stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|TV5 Network}}\n\n===The early years (1960\u20131972)===\n[[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]], owner of the [[Manila Times]] was granted of a radio-TV franchise from [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] under [[Republic Act]] 2945 on 19 June 1960.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]]. Both ABC and the [[Manila Times]] were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network|RBS]], and [[Manila Broadcasting Company|MBC]]'s radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day.\n\nAfter the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival [[ABS-CBN]] reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after.\n\nNew stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]].\n\n===The return and growth (1992\u20132003)===\nABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]] in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM-TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations.\n\nABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under [[Republic Act]] 7831 (will expire on 9 December 2019) signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel Valdez Ramos]]. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \"The Fastest Growing Network\" under new network executive [[Tina Monzon-Palma]] who served as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nIn 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' (hosted by [[Dawn Zulueta]] and later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); ''[[Wheel of Fortune (game show) in different countries|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]], later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (hosted by [[Ogie Alcasid]], later acquired by [[GMA Network]] and then by [[ABS-CBN]]). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]'s Philippine editions of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' (hosted by [[Christopher de Leon]], which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by [[Vic Sotto]]) and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (hosted by [[Edu Manzano]]).\n\n===The Cojuangco era (2003\u20132008)===\nIn October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and owner of [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite Broadcasting]] and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \"Iba Tayo!\" (\"We're Different!\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jazmines|first1=Tessa|title=DTH station buys terrestrial TV channel|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/dth-station-buys-terrestrial-tv-channel-1117896313/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=30 November 2003}}</ref> ABC continued to support [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], and its religious pre-identification campaign \"Please Pray the Rosary\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp.\n\nIn 2005, ABC won the \"Outstanding TV Station\" award at the 2005 [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas|KBP Golden Dove Awards]], with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories.\n\nIn early 2007, ABC implemented a series of [[budget cut]]s, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 general elections]], left ABC almost incapable of coverage.\n\nIn November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball, pro boxing, and [[WWE]] events, as part of a new five-year deal with [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]]. However, due to their high costs and poor ratings, these programs were later dropped throughout 2008, and its NBA review show \"House of Hoops\" was cut back as well and eventually cancelled by April 2008. However, much of these programs, along with the PBA (as ABC elected not to renew its contract through the ended after the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference|2008 Fiesta Conference]]), would be picked up by [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], who had begun a much wider partnership with Solar earlier in 2007, which led to its privatization by the latter in 2011.\n\n===TV5 era (2008\u20132018)===\n\n==== ABC-MPB Primedia Partnership (2008\u20132010) ====\nIn March 2008, Cojuangco announced that ABC had reached a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]] of [[Malaysia]] as part of a long-term strategy to make the network more competitive. MPB Primedia, meanwhile, was formed to serve as seed asset for Media Prima's proposed private equity fund to invest in various media companies within Southeast Asia.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2009/10/14/media-prima-set-to-exit-philippine-tv/ Media Prima set to exit Philippine TV] Accessed 8 October 2018</ref> Cojuangco said MPB Primedia Inc., in principle, would produce and source most of the entertainment programs while ABC would continue to be responsible for news programming and operation of the stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|title=ABC Signs Content Partnership with Malaysia-Backed Group|publisher=ABC.com.ph|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012656/http://abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|archivedate=27 July 2008}}</ref> MPB Primedia was also given exclusive right to schedule and manage sale of ABC-5's airtime.

This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and its employees were laid off, including [[Wilma Galvante]], its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resizes TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nIncapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed [[Viva Entertainment]] CEO, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture [[Sari-Sari Channel]] and outsourcing [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Television]] for its entertainment shows, including [[Ang Panday (2016 TV series)|a revival of ''Ang Panday'']], the return of [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Claudine Barretto]]'s tandem in ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' and shows from by-then sister station [[MTV Pinoy]] such as ''Top 20 Pilipinas''. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings.\n\nSince January 2016, TV5 and [[Cignal]] via [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]] will be the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the Philippines.\n\nBy July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from [[MTV]] and [[MTV International]] like ''[[Catfish]]'', ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' and ''[[Ex on the Beach]]'' after inking a deal with [[Viacom International Media Networks]] that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs ''[[Aksyon Bisaya]]'' (Cebu) and ''[[Aksyon Dabaw]]'' (Davao) due to cost-cutting measures. With this move, the personnel remained employed as they will continue file reports for ''[[Aksyon]]'' newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/local-news/2016/09/09/cost-cutting-leaves-tv5-cebu-journalists-workers-limbo-496590|title=Cost cutting leaves TV5 Cebu journalists, workers in limbo|publisher=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Baquero|first=Elias O.|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 2016, TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \"Noel\" C. Lorenzana stepped down from his position. He was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head, Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes the following day. Following his appointment, the network announced it would be retrenching around 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization.\n\nIn April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air the [[WWE]] after [[Fox Channel Asia|Fox Philippines]] decision to not renew its contract with the WWE due to unknown reasons. The network previously handle the rights from 2007\u201308 and 2010.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with [[ESPN]], licensing its PBA, UFC, PSL and NFL rights and giving TV5 access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership formed the '''ESPN5''' brand, that is airing on TV5 and [[AksyonTV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TV5 and ESPN collaborate to launch ESPN 5|url=http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|work=Sports5|publisher=[[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]]|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201619/http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|archivedate=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Interaksyon|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE &#124; TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sports/2017/10/12/102970/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=Interaksyon|publisher=Philstar Global Corporation|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=Richmond|title=TV5 narrows losses in 2018|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/11/1883955/tv5-narrows-losses-2018|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The 5 Network era (2018\u20132020) ===\nOn 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply '''5''' with a new logo and station ID entitled ''Get It on 5'', whereas the TV on the top right quadrant of the logo has been dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid has also divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the ''Kapatid'' moniker was also deemphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the slow quiet phraseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a feature that dated back from its MPB Primedia era in 2008. Today, even more of its ''Disney Club on 5'' programs and more of its movies are now aired in the English language.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It has also since included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, [[Chot Reyes]] retired as TV5 President and CEO, which was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, which leads pay-TV provider and radio company [[Cignal TV|Cignal TV/Mediascape]]. Since her appointment, 5 has begun to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels [[One News (Philippines)|One News]], [[One PH]], [[One Sports (Philippines)|One Sports]], and [[PBA Rush]]; it has also phased out its daytime [[ESPN5]] programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station [[5 Plus]] in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; which includes retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from [[Cignal TV#Cignal Entertainment|Cignal Entertainment]] and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November.\n\nTV5 Network got its  25-year franchise extension under [[Republic Act]] 11320 but lapsed-into-law on 22 April 2019 without President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]]'s signature coincided with the 25-year franchise extension of [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] under [[Republic Act]] 11319 also lapsed-into-law on that same day  without Chief Executive's signature.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang has been appointed as the new President and CEO of TV5 Network and [[Cignal TV]], replacing Basas who has been appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of [[Smart Communications]].\n\nOn 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer bears the ''ESPN5'' banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de-facto sports portal of One Sports and ESPN in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as '''One TV''' (adopting from Cignal TV's \"One\"-branded channels) on 13 April 2020. However, if the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|coronavirus pandemic]] and the Luzon-wide community quarantine extends, the rebranding will be moved to the second half of 2020.\n\n==Branding of 5==\n===Network identity===\nOn 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today.\n\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Corporation''' (1960\u20131972) \u2014 founded by [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]] by President Marcos.\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Company''' (1992\u20132008) \u2014 fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003.\n:*'''TV5''' (2008\u20132018) \u2014 renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]]. In 2010, [[Media Prima]] divested its share with [[MediaQuest Holdings|MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] to business tycoon [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. Upon relaunch as ''5'', the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers.\n:*'''5 (The 5 Network)''' (2018\u20132020) \u2014 TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply ''5'' on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, '''TV5''' was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself.\n:*'''One TV''' (2Q/3Q 2020-presents) - 5 will be relaunched as One TV starting on the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2020. This will make them the 6th TV station under PLDT-Smart's MediaQuest to take the \"One\" branding.\n\n===Logos===\nTV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV|DZTM-TV]] carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors [[red]], [[blue]] and [[green]]\u2014colors making up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]] technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan Come home to ABC, the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan Iba Tayo. The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re-launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear.\n\nIn 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on [[ESPN5]] logo, which was launched on October 2017, dropping the \"TV\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their ''Get It on 5'' campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \"(title) ''on 5''\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \"on\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions [[News5]], [[DWFM|Radyo 5]], and [[Digital5|D5 Studio]].\n\nA variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the newly launched network, [[5 Plus]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by 5 (TV channel)}}\n5's program lineup includes news and current affairs programs, dubbed cartoons, movies, American drama, sports, informative, talk shows, infomercials and Japanese anime shows.\n\nOn its second month since its re-launch last 9 August 2008, TV5 has been reportedly on Top 3 based on the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|AGB Nielsen]] survey. It also gained its rating on their ''Nick on TV5'' morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block.\n\nIn 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, [[Wilma Galvante]] (2012\u20132015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \"Happy Ka Dito!\" campaign.\n\nIn 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \"Happy sa 2015\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA.\n\nMonths later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva]] executive, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with [[Viva Entertainment]] last 25 November 2015. However, all programs produced by Viva were phased out between July and August 2016 due to management disagreements following an attempted partnership of shows.\n\nJust recently, [[Brillante Mendoza]] signed a contract with TV5 last December 2016 to make made-for-TV movies to be aired on the network under the ''Brillante Mendoza Presents'' umbrella. Unfortunately, the actual date of mini-series ''Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo'', that supposed to premiere on TV5, was cancelled due to unknown reasons.\n\nSince 2017, [[NFL]] games began to broadcast on TV5, replacing the TV5 Kids presents Cartoon Network block (whereas [[Cartoon Network (Asia)|Cartoon Network]] shows were moved to [[GMA Network]] since [[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|Ben 10]] on 29 March 2018 and [[CNN Philippines]] on 1 September 2018 in original English-language audio.)<ref>{{cite web|date=7 September 2017|author=ralphierce|title=TV5 Pulls Out Cartoon Network Shows, Refurbish Lineup Anew with NFL, Cockfighting, Japan Japan and Amo|publisher=From the Tube|url=https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/tv5-pulls-out-cartoon-network-shows-refurbish-lineup-anew-with-nfl-cockfighting-japan-japan-and-amo/}}</ref>\n\nThe network also started airing selected shows from the [[Sari-Sari Channel]] under the ''Sari-Sari sa Weekends'' banner.\n\nAfter several months of hiatus, the local drama ''[[Amo (TV series)|Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo]]'' was premiered on 21 April 2018.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, all foreign entertainment shows broadcast on 5 started to be broadcast in the original English-language audio instead of Filipino dubbed audio (except ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' and Sine Squad on weekends).\n\nIn March 2019, the Sine Squad movie block on weekends are now aired in original English audio (except on weekday afternoons in Filipino dubbed audio starting June 2019).\n\nOn 23 September 2019, upon 5's expansion of its movie blocks, they returned in airing the Filipino language dubbing instead of the original English audio. However, in January of 2020, the primetime movie blocks returned to the original English audio as reruns of 5 programming took the place of the afternoon movies.\n\n==Kapatid Channel==\n{{Main|Kapatid Channel}}\n\nTV5 programs are seen internationally via [[Kapatid Channel]], and is currently available in [[Guam]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/media/tv/ Media Ownership Monitor Philippines - Television] by VERA Files and [[Reporters Without Borders]]\n\n{{Commons category|Associated Broadcasting Company}}\n\n{{TV5|state=expanded}}\n{{Television in the Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:1960 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:The 5 Network| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Mandaluyong]]\n[[Category:Digital terrestrial television in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television stations]]\n[[Category:Media companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine television networks]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1960]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1972]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Television in Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:Television in the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Philippine TV channel called TV5|parent company of the same name|TV5 Network|other TV channels called TV5|TV5 (disambiguation){{!}}TV5}}\n{{redirect|ABC 5|other channels|ABC 5 (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|TV channel in the Philippines}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox broadcasting network\n| network_name   = 5 (The 5 Network)\n| network_logo   = TV5 (ABC5) Logo.svg\n| branding       = The ''Kapatid'' Network <small>(''Kapatid'' is the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] term for \"sibling\")</small>\n| slogan         = \n| country        = [[Philippines]]\n| market_share   = 7.6% <small>([[AGB Nielsen Philippines|Nielsen]] Urban National TAM January\u2013August 2016)</small><ref>{{cite web|title=Media Ownership Monitor Philippines - TV5|url=http://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/media/detail/outlet/tv5/|publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]]|accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n| network_type   = [[Terrestrial television|Terrestrial]] [[commercial television|commercial]] [[television network]]\n| available      = National <!-- Kapatid TV is a separate channel and not this one -->\n| founded        = {{start date and age|df=y|1960|6|19}}<ref name=\"ra2945\">{{cite web |title=Republic Act 2945 |url=https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-2945.php |date=19 June 1960}}</ref>\n| founder        = [[Chino Roces]]\n| tvstations     = [[List of 5 (TV channel) TV and radio stations|List of 5 stations]]\n| language       = [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (main)<br />[[English language|English]] (secondary)\n| headquarters   = San Bartolome, Novaliches, [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]] <small>(1992\u20132013)</small><br />[[TV5 Media Center]], Reliance cor.

It is the flagship property of [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]], which is owned by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], the multimedia arm of [[Philippines|Philippine-based]] telecommunications company [[PLDT]]. \n5 is also formally referred to as \"The ''Kapatid'' Network\", the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] term for \"sibling\", which was introduced in 2010.\n\nNamed after its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV]], which are carried in VHF Channel 5 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 51 (digital test broadcast; though the latter is licensed to TV5's sister company [[Cignal TV|Mediascape/Cignal TV]])  with channel 18 served as a permanent assigned digital frequency. 5 is also broadcasting to 7 other owned-and-operated stations, and 19 affiliated television stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|TV5 Network}}\n\n===The early years (1960\u20131972)===\n[[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]], owner of the [[Manila Times]] was granted of a radio-TV franchise from [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] under [[Republic Act]] 2945 on 19 June 1960.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]]. Both ABC and the [[Manila Times]] were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network|RBS]], and [[Manila Broadcasting Company|MBC]]'s radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day.\n\nAfter the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival [[ABS-CBN]] reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after.\n\nNew stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]].\n\n===The return and growth (1992\u20132003)===\nABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]] in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM-TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations.\n\nABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under [[Republic Act]] 7831 (will expire on 9 December 2019) signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel Valdez Ramos]]. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \"The Fastest Growing Network\" under new network executive [[Tina Monzon-Palma]] who served as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nIn 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' (hosted by [[Dawn Zulueta]] and later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); ''[[Wheel of Fortune (game show) in different countries|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]], later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (hosted by [[Ogie Alcasid]], later acquired by [[GMA Network]] and then by [[ABS-CBN]]). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]'s Philippine editions of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' (hosted by [[Christopher de Leon]], which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by [[Vic Sotto]]) and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (hosted by [[Edu Manzano]]).\n\n===The Cojuangco era (2003\u20132008)===\nIn October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and owner of [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite Broadcasting]] and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \"Iba Tayo!\" (\"We're Different!\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jazmines|first1=Tessa|title=DTH station buys terrestrial TV channel|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/dth-station-buys-terrestrial-tv-channel-1117896313/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=30 November 2003}}</ref> ABC continued to support [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], and its religious pre-identification campaign \"Please Pray the Rosary\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp.\n\nIn 2005, ABC won the \"Outstanding TV Station\" award at the 2005 [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas|KBP Golden Dove Awards]], with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories.\n\nIn early 2007, ABC implemented a series of [[budget cut]]s, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 general elections]], left ABC almost incapable of coverage.\n\nIn November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball, pro boxing, and [[WWE]] events, as part of a new five-year deal with [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]].

This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and its employees were laid off, including [[Wilma Galvante]], its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resizes TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nIncapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed [[Viva Entertainment]] CEO, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture [[Sari-Sari Channel]] and outsourcing [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Television]] for its entertainment shows, including [[Ang Panday (2016 TV series)|a revival of ''Ang Panday'']], the return of [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Claudine Barretto]]'s tandem in ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' and shows from by-then sister station [[MTV Pinoy]] such as ''Top 20 Pilipinas''. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings.\n\nSince January 2016, TV5 and [[Cignal]] via [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]] will be the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the Philippines.\n\nBy July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from [[MTV]] and [[MTV International]] like ''[[Catfish]]'', ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' and ''[[Ex on the Beach]]'' after inking a deal with [[Viacom International Media Networks]] that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs ''[[Aksyon Bisaya]]'' (Cebu) and ''[[Aksyon Dabaw]]'' (Davao) due to cost-cutting measures. With this move, the personnel remained employed as they will continue file reports for ''[[Aksyon]]'' newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/local-news/2016/09/09/cost-cutting-leaves-tv5-cebu-journalists-workers-limbo-496590|title=Cost cutting leaves TV5 Cebu journalists, workers in limbo|publisher=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Baquero|first=Elias O.|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 2016, TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \"Noel\" C. Lorenzana stepped down from his position. He was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head, Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes the following day. Following his appointment, the network announced it would be retrenching around 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization.\n\nIn April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air the [[WWE]] after [[Fox Channel Asia|Fox Philippines]] decision to not renew its contract with the WWE due to unknown reasons. The network previously handle the rights from 2007\u201308 and 2010.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with [[ESPN]], licensing its PBA, UFC, PSL and NFL rights and giving TV5 access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership formed the '''ESPN5''' brand, that is airing on TV5 and [[AksyonTV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TV5 and ESPN collaborate to launch ESPN 5|url=http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|work=Sports5|publisher=[[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]]|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201619/http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|archivedate=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Interaksyon|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE &#124; TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sports/2017/10/12/102970/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=Interaksyon|publisher=Philstar Global Corporation|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=Richmond|title=TV5 narrows losses in 2018|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/11/1883955/tv5-narrows-losses-2018|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The 5 Network era (2018\u20132020) ===\nOn 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply '''5''' with a new logo and station ID entitled ''Get It on 5'', whereas the TV on the top right quadrant of the logo has been dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid has also divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the ''Kapatid'' moniker was also deemphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the slow quiet phraseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a feature that dated back from its MPB Primedia era in 2008. Today, even more of its ''Disney Club on 5'' programs and more of its movies are now aired in the English language.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It has also since included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, [[Chot Reyes]] retired as TV5 President and CEO, which was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, which leads pay-TV provider and radio company [[Cignal TV|Cignal TV/Mediascape]]. Since her appointment, 5 has begun to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels [[One News (Philippines)|One News]], [[One PH]], [[One Sports (Philippines)|One Sports]], and [[PBA Rush]]; it has also phased out its daytime [[ESPN5]] programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station [[5 Plus]] in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; which includes retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from [[Cignal TV#Cignal Entertainment|Cignal Entertainment]] and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November.\n\nTV5 Network got its  25-year franchise extension under [[Republic Act]] 11320 but lapsed-into-law on 22 April 2019 without President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]]'s signature coincided with the 25-year franchise extension of [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] under [[Republic Act]] 11319 also lapsed-into-law on that same day  without Chief Executive's signature.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang has been appointed as the new President and CEO of TV5 Network and [[Cignal TV]], replacing Basas who has been appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of [[Smart Communications]].\n\nOn 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer bears the ''ESPN5'' banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de-facto sports portal of One Sports and ESPN in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as '''One TV''' (adopting from Cignal TV's \"One\"-branded channels) on 13 April 2020. However, if the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|coronavirus pandemic]] and the Luzon-wide community quarantine extends, the rebranding will be moved to the second half of 2020.\n\n==Branding of 5==\n===Network identity===\nOn 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today.\n\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Corporation''' (1960\u20131972) \u2014 founded by [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]] by President Marcos.\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Company''' (1992\u20132008) \u2014 fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003.\n:*'''TV5''' (2008\u20132018) \u2014 renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]]. In 2010, [[Media Prima]] divested its share with [[MediaQuest Holdings|MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] to business tycoon [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. Upon relaunch as ''5'', the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers.\n:*'''5 (The 5 Network)''' (2018\u20132020) \u2014 TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply ''5'' on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, '''TV5''' was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself.\n:*'''One TV''' (2Q/3Q 2020) - 5 will be relaunched as One TV starting on the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of 2020. This will make them the 6th TV station under PLDT-Smart's MediaQuest to take the \"One\" branding.\n\n===Logos===\nTV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV|DZTM-TV]] carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors [[red]], [[blue]] and [[green]]\u2014colors making up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]] technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan Come home to ABC, the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan Iba Tayo. The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re-launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear.\n\nIn 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on [[ESPN5]] logo, which was launched on October 2017, dropping the \"TV\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their ''Get It on 5'' campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \"(title) ''on 5''\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \"on\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions [[News5]], [[DWFM|Radyo 5]], and [[Digital5|D5 Studio]].\n\nA variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the newly launched network, [[5 Plus]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by 5 (TV channel)}}\n5's program lineup includes news and current affairs programs, dubbed cartoons, movies, American drama, sports, informative, talk shows, infomercials and Japanese anime shows.\n\nOn its second month since its re-launch last 9 August 2008, TV5 has been reportedly on Top 3 based on the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|AGB Nielsen]] survey. It also gained its rating on their ''Nick on TV5'' morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block.\n\nIn 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, [[Wilma Galvante]] (2012\u20132015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \"Happy Ka Dito!\" campaign.\n\nIn 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \"Happy sa 2015\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA.\n\nMonths later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva]] executive, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with [[Viva Entertainment]] last 25 November 2015. However, all programs produced by Viva were phased out between July and August 2016 due to management disagreements following an attempted partnership of shows.\n\nJust recently, [[Brillante Mendoza]] signed a contract with TV5 last December 2016 to make made-for-TV movies to be aired on the network under the ''Brillante Mendoza Presents'' umbrella. Unfortunately, the actual date of mini-series ''Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo'', that supposed to premiere on TV5, was cancelled due to unknown reasons.\n\nSince 2017, [[NFL]] games began to broadcast on TV5, replacing the TV5 Kids presents Cartoon Network block (whereas [[Cartoon Network (Asia)|Cartoon Network]] shows were moved to [[GMA Network]] since [[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|Ben 10]] on 29 March 2018 and [[CNN Philippines]] on 1 September 2018 in original English-language audio.)<ref>{{cite web|date=7 September 2017|author=ralphierce|title=TV5 Pulls Out Cartoon Network Shows, Refurbish Lineup Anew with NFL, Cockfighting, Japan Japan and Amo|publisher=From the Tube|url=https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/tv5-pulls-out-cartoon-network-shows-refurbish-lineup-anew-with-nfl-cockfighting-japan-japan-and-amo/}}</ref>\n\nThe network also started airing selected shows from the [[Sari-Sari Channel]] under the ''Sari-Sari sa Weekends'' banner.\n\nAfter several months of hiatus, the local drama ''[[Amo (TV series)|Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo]]'' was premiered on 21 April 2018.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, all foreign entertainment shows broadcast on 5 started to be broadcast in the original English-language audio instead of Filipino dubbed audio (except ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' and Sine Squad on weekends).\n\nIn March 2019, the Sine Squad movie block on weekends are now aired in original English audio (except on weekday afternoons in Filipino dubbed audio starting June 2019).\n\nOn 23 September 2019, upon 5's expansion of its movie blocks, they returned in airing the Filipino language dubbing instead of the original English audio. However, in January of 2020, the primetime movie blocks returned to the original English audio as reruns of 5 programming took the place of the afternoon movies.\n\n==Kapatid Channel==\n{{Main|Kapatid Channel}}\n\nTV5 programs are seen internationally via [[Kapatid Channel]], and is currently available in [[Guam]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/media/tv/ Media Ownership Monitor Philippines - Television] by VERA Files and [[Reporters Without Borders]]\n\n{{Commons category|Associated Broadcasting Company}}\n\n{{TV5|state=expanded}}\n{{Television in the Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:1960 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:The 5 Network| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Mandaluyong]]\n[[Category:Digital terrestrial television in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television stations]]\n[[Category:Media companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine television networks]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1960]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1972]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Television in Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:Television in the Philippines]]\n", "name_user": "112.198.211.81", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_(TV_channel)"}

During The [[Soviet-Finnish war]], the 147th fighter aviation regiment was based at the airfield on I-15 bis, I-16 and I-153 aircraft. With the beginning of the great Patriotic war, the 147th fighter aviation regiment, based at the airfield, performed tasks to cover Murmansk and the Kirov railway from German air raids. From July 1941, the regiment received MiG-3 aircraft, which it used until the spring of 1942. In mid-July 1941, the regiment included four MiG-3s designed to intercept enemy bombers and by the end of the month received 17 MiG-3s. In January 1942, the regiment received P-40 Tomahawk aircraft.\n\nFor exemplary performance of command assignments at the front against the German invaders and displaying valor and courage, by the decree of the [[Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet]] from 22 February 1943, the regiment was awarded order of the red banner. The regiment was based at the airfield until the spring of 1945.\n\nIn November 2015, [[Novaport]] bought out the Murmansk Airport from its former owner, [[Gazprom]] Oil, with the aim to develop flights from the low-cost airline [[Pobeda (airline)|Pobeda]] to the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusaviainsider.com/novaport-intends-to-take-full-control-of-murmansk-airport/|title=Novaport intends to take full control of Murmansk Airport|website=Rusaviainsider.com|date=20 November 2015|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Terminals==\n\n===Passanger terminal===\n\nOn the ground floor of the only passenger terminal there are check-in counters, waiting room, international zone, cafes and souvenir shops.

During The [[Soviet-Finnish war]], the 147th fighter aviation regiment was based at the airfield on I-15 bis, I-16 and I-153 aircraft. With the beginning of the great Patriotic war, the 147th fighter aviation regiment, based at the airfield, performed tasks to cover Murmansk and the Kirov railway from German air raids. From July 1941, the regiment received MiG-3 aircraft, which it used until the spring of 1942. In mid-July 1941, the regiment included four MiG-3s designed to intercept enemy bombers and by the end of the month received 17 MiG-3s. In January 1942, the regiment received P-40 Tomahawk aircraft.\n\nFor exemplary performance of command assignments at the front against the German invaders and displaying valor and courage, by the decree of the [[Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet]] from 22 February 1943, the regiment was awarded order of the red banner. The regiment was based at the airfield until the spring of 1945.\n\nIn November 2015, [[Novaport]] bought out the Murmansk Airport from its former owner, [[Gazprom]] Oil, with the aim to develop flights from the low-cost airline [[Pobeda (airline)|Pobeda]] to the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rusaviainsider.com/novaport-intends-to-take-full-control-of-murmansk-airport/|title=Novaport intends to take full control of Murmansk Airport|website=Rusaviainsider.com|date=20 November 2015|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Terminals==\n\n===Passanger terminal===\n\nOn the ground floor of the only passenger terminal there are check-in counters, waiting room, international zone, cafes and souvenir shops.

The arrival zones are located on the first floors \u2014 in the right (\"arrival hall B\") and left (\"arrival hall A\") wings of the building. There is also a hall for VIP guests, where inspection and check-in takes place separately from other passengers.\n\n===Cargo terminal===\n\nThe cargo terminal with an area of 400\u043c\u00b2 is

There is a total ban on [[Automatic firearm|automatic firearms]] for civilians, unless they fall into the collector category. Modification of semi-automatic guns into fully automatic without the consent of the police is a felony crime.\n\n[[Handgun]]s have some calibre restrictions. A [[Smith & Wesson Model 500]], for example, is illegal due to its high power, but other, less powerful guns, are legal as they are used in sports shooting. Norway has a long tradition of high-end sports shooting competitions, especially rifle shooting. Each calibre must be used in some type of competition to be allowed. Also, there is a restriction on the number of weapons an owner can have for each calibre. For recreational shooters, only one gun is allowed in each calibre. For professional and semi-professional shooters, a spare gun is allowed. A recreational shooter is only allowed to own four different handguns. To obtain more, documentation on extensive involvement in [[sport shooting]] is needed.\n\n== Ownership ==\n\nGun ownership is restricted in Norway, unless one has officially documented a use for the gun. By far the most common grounds for civilian ownership are hunting and sports shooting, in that order. Other needs can include special guard duties or self-defense, but the first is rare unless the person shows identification confirming that he or she is a trained guard or member of a law-enforcement agency.\n\nThere are special rules for collectors of guns. They are exempt from many parts of the regulation, but, in turn, they must meet even narrower qualifications. Collectors may purchase, but not fire without permission, all kinds of guns in their respective areas of interest, which they have defined in advance.\n\nOwnership is regulated in paragraph 7,<ref name=\"law\"/> and responsibility for issuing a gun ownership license is given to the police authority in the applicant's district.\n\nRifle and shotgun ownership permission can be given to \"sober and responsible\" persons 18 years or older. The applicant for the permission must document a need for the weapon. Two exceptions exist to this age qualification. Persons under the age of 18, but over 16 may apply for rifle or shotgun ownership licence with the consent of parents or guardian. For handguns, the lowest ownership age is 21 with no exceptions allowed. For inherited weapons, it is up to the local police chief to make a decision based on the individual facts of the case.\n\nAn applicant must have a clean [[police record]] in order to obtain an ownership license.\n\n== Obtaining a license ==\n\nThere are two ways of obtaining an ownership license in Norway. The most common is through the process of obtaining a [[hunting license]], the other is through a sports shooting license.\n\n=== For hunting ===\n\nTo obtain a hunting license, the applicant must complete a 30-hour, 9-session course and pass a written multiple choice exam. The course includes firearm theory, firearm training, wildlife theory, and environmental protection training.\n\nOnce the exam is passed, the applicant may enroll in the hunter registry and receive a hunting license. The membership must be renewed each year, through license payment. The hunting license is brought to the police station, where the applicant fills out an application for obtaining the proper firearm for his or her hunt. After evaluation, part of the application is sent back to the applicant if it was approved. Upon approval, the applicant can take the returned form to the store and purchase the firearm listed in the application.\n\n=== For sports shooters ===\nThe qualification process for sporting is theoretically easier, but requires more time and practice. The applicant must enroll in a firearm safety course, lasting at least 9 hours. The course includes a written test, but is shorter than the hunting exam, as it only deals with firearm safety. Two thirds of the course are completed on the shooting range as practice. The passing of the test results in acceptance to the approved gun club, and a license for competition. However, while the hunters can obtain their firearm almost at once, sports shooters must prove their intentions to compete by actively training or competing in the gun club. This means regular attendance (at least 15 times) at gun club training over the course of six months. The applicant must use firearms owned by the club or borrowed at the range for this period. After six months, the applicant may apply for weapon ownership. The start license and a written recommendation from the gun club president are brought to the police station, and the competition class is filled out on the application. If approved, it will be returned to the applicant as with the hunter license.\n\nIn both cases, if the application is rejected, the applicant is allowed an explanation of the reason, and an appeal.\n\n==== For competition shooters in DFS ====\nFor competitive shooters in [[Det frivillige Skyttervesen]] (DFS) you will need an active membership for 6 months, and limitations for membership is Norwegian Nationals only. There is training course for youth from age 8 and up to 18, for adults an introduction to safety and behavior on the range is given, no written exams are required. Active members can apply for rifles approved by DFS competitions such as [[Sauer 200 STR]] in caliber [[6.5\u00d755 Scan]], [[308 Win]], and [[22lr]] only, Other approved rifles is [[Krag-J\u00f8rgensen]], [[Mauser M98]], and other competition bolt action rifles in 22lr with trigger pull of 1.5&nbsp;kg\n\n== Guns in civilian ownership ==\nThe laws for storage of firearms are strict.\n\nFor shotguns and rifles, the requirement given in the weapons act is to have the firearm, or a vital part of it, securely locked away. Generally, this means an approved [[gun safe]], securely bolted to a non-removable part of the house. (A vital part is considered to be the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] group\u2014the bolt head will suffice\u2014for rifles, the slide for pistols, or the barrel of a shotgun.)\n\nThe police are allowed to make a home inspection of the safe. An inspection must be announced more than 48 hours in advance, and the police are only allowed to see the safe and make sure it is legally installed.\n\n[[Ammunition]] is generally only sold to persons with valid weapon license. However, if one is in possession of a legally unregistered shotgun bought before 1 April 1990, and is in the hunter registry, one can purchase shotgun ammunition by showing a firearms license or a hunting permit. Without a special permit only 10,000 rounds of ammunition can be stored by a single person, or 15,000 rounds if 5,000 of them are [[.22 LR]] or smaller calibre. Two kg of [[black powder]] may be stored in a separate building if the person has a license for a black-powder firearm.\n\nOlder rules stated that the ammunition must be locked away separately, but these rules were abandoned in the latest revision of the weapons act.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe owner must always have a good reason to bring the weapon to a public place. Such reasons include transportation to a range or hunting area, transportation for repairs, or for maintenance and hobby activities.\n\nDuring transportation, the weapon must be empty and concealed, but not worn on the body, and under the constant supervision of the owner. This applies equally to replicas, air guns and decommissioned firearms.\n\n== Firearm ownership ==\nAs of 2017 there are 1,329,000 (or 25 per 100 people) registered firearms owned by 486,028 (or 9% of population) people in Norway<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/44MnG/naa-er-det-over-13-millioner-private-skytevaapen-i-norge-to-distrikter-troner-klart-oeverst-paa-vaapenstatistikken|title=N\u00e5 er det over 1,3 millioner private skytev\u00e5pen i Norge.
