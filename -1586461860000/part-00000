[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kenneth H.|last2=Bradford|first2=Judith B.|last3=Makadon|first3=Harvey J.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Goldhammer|first5=Hilary|last6=Landers|first6=Stewart|date=2008|title=Sexual and Gender Minority Health: What We Know and What Needs to Be Done|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=989\u2013995|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.127811|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2377288|pmid=18445789}}</ref>\n\nThough [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] (LGBTQ) people have existed throughout human history, LGBT rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ people as members of a minority group.<ref name=\":6\"/> LGBTQ people represent a numerical and social minority.

Many started to believe that they were being denied basic human rights. This act had a section that stated if authorities did not protect people with learning disabilities from others actions such as harm or neglect, then they could be prosecuted.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Clements|first=Luke|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t8964p|title=Disabled people and European human rights: A review of the implications of the 1998 Human Rights Act for disabled children and adults in the UK|last2=Read|first2=Janet|date=2003|publisher=Bristol University Press|edition=1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[disability rights movement]] has contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize difference in physical or psychological functioning, rather than inferiority. For example, some people with [[autism]] argue for acceptance of [[neurodiversity]], much as opponents of [[racism]] argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The [[deaf community]] is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some [[deaf]] people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions that are designed to cater for the dominant group. (''See the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]''.)\n\n<br />\n\n=== Religious minorities ===\n{{main|Minority religion}}\nPeople belonging to religious minorities have a faith which is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the west that people should have the freedom to choose their own religion, including not having any religion ([[atheism]] and/or [[agnosticism]]), and including the right to convert from one religion to another. However, in many countries this freedom is constricted. In [[Egypt]], a new system of identity cards<ref>See \"The Situation of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Community of Egypt\" and \"Religion Today: Bahais' struggle for recognition reveals a less tolerant face of Egypt\", [http://www.bahai.org/persecution/egypt/update Bahai.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001140937/http://www.bahai.org/persecution/egypt/update |date=2006-10-01 }},  [http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html DWB.sacbee.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053747/http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html |date=2007-10-14 }}</ref> requires all citizens to state their religion\u2014and the only choices are [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], or [[Judaism]] (See [[Egyptian identification card controversy]]).

Though women are not categorically a minority<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/minority |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=02/06/2020}}</ref>, the status of women as a subordinate group has led to many social scientists to study them as a minority group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Helen Mayer|year=1951|title=Women as a Minority Group|journal=[[Social Forces]]|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60\u201369|doi=10.2307/2571742|jstor=2571742}}</ref> Though women's legal rights and status vary widely across countries, women experience social inequalities relative to men in most societies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Multicultural jurisdictions : cultural differences and women's rights|last=1966-|first=Shachar, Ayelet|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0511040801|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=56216656}}</ref> Women are often denied access to education, subject to violence, and lack access to the same economic opportunities as men.<ref>Women, U. N. (2018). Annual Report 2017\u20132018.</ref>\n\n== Law and government ==\nIn the politics of some countries, a \"minority\" is an [[ethnic group]] recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized [[minority language]], for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions{{which|date=May 2016}} for minorities include [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Croatia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check \"Other\" on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group.\n\nMany contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for [[race (U.S. Census)|race and ethnicity]] on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. [[Spain]] does not divide its nationals by ethnic group, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages.\n\nSome especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav republic of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see [[nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). However, other minorities such as [[Romani people|Romani]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00421|title=Political recognition of Roma People in Spain.

One view<ref>For example, J.A. Lindgren-Alves, member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, speaking at the Committee's 67th Session (Summary Record of the 1724th Meeting, 23 August 2005, CERD/C/SR.1724)</ref> is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European [[nation-state]] model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to [[separatism]] or [[supremacist|supremacism]]. In [[Canada]], some{{who|date=January 2012}} feel that the failure of the dominant [[English language|English]]-speaking majority to integrate [[French Canadians]] has provoked [[Quebec separatism]].\n\nOthers assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalised: for example, [[bilingual education]] may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.<ref>See {{cite book |first=K. |last=Henrard |title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination |location= |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=2000 |pages=218\u2013224 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFF5nzuAze0C&pg=PA218 |isbn=978-9041113597 |access-date=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228001145/https://books.google.com/books?id=QFF5nzuAze0C&pg=PA218 |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Dominant minority]]\n* [[Ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Ethnic penalty]]\n* [[Intangible cultural heritage]]\n* [[Interminority racism]]\n* [[List of active non-governmental organizations of national minorities, indigenous and diasporas|List of active NGOs of national minorities]]\n* [[List of minority political parties]]\n* [[Middleman minority]]\n* [[Minority influence]]\n* [[Minority language]]\n* [[Minority (philosophy)]]\n* [[Minority religion]]\n* [[Minority Rights Group International]]\n* [[Model minority]]\n* [[Serge Moscovici#Minority influence|Serge Moscovici]]\n* [[Social exclusion]]\n* [[Social stratification]]\n* [[Tokenism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.souz-minor.ru Union of Minority Shareholders]\n*[http://www.ecmi.de ECMI -

Because of their focus on success, voluntary minorities are more likely to do better in school than other migrating minorities.<ref name=\":02\" /> Adapting to a very different culture and language make difficulties in the early stages of life in the new country.

For example, men who have sex with men (MSM), but do not identify as gay. In addition, the term gender minorities can include many types of [[Gender variance|gender variant]] people, such as [[intersex]] people, [[Transsexuality|transgender people]], or gender non-conforming individuals. However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kenneth H.|last2=Bradford|first2=Judith B.|last3=Makadon|first3=Harvey J.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Goldhammer|first5=Hilary|last6=Landers|first6=Stewart|date=2008|title=Sexual and Gender Minority Health: What We Know and What Needs to Be Done|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=989\u2013995|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.127811|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2377288|pmid=18445789}}</ref>\n\nThough [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] (LGBTQ) people have existed throughout human history, LGBT rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ people as members of a minority group.<ref name=\":6\"/> LGBTQ people represent a numerical and social minority. They experience numerous social inequalities stemming from their group membership as LGBTQ people. These inequalities include social discrimination and isolation, unequal access to healthcare, employment, and housing, and experience negative mental and physical health outcomes due to these experiences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== People with disabilities ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nThe [[disability rights movement]] has contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize difference in physical or psychological functioning, rather than inferiority. For example, some people with [[autism]] argue for acceptance of [[neurodiversity]], much as opponents of [[racism]] argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The [[deaf community]] is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some [[deaf]] people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions that are designed to cater for the dominant group. (''See the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]''.)\n\n=== Religious minorities ===\n{{main|Minority religion}}\nPeople belonging to religious minorities have a faith which is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the west that people should have the freedom to choose their own religion, including not having any religion ([[atheism]] and/or [[agnosticism]]), and including the right to convert from one religion to another. However, in many countries this freedom is constricted. In [[Egypt]], a new system of identity cards<ref>See \"The Situation of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Community of Egypt\" and \"Religion Today: Bahais' struggle for recognition reveals a less tolerant face of Egypt\", [http://www.bahai.org/persecution/egypt/update Bahai.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001140937/http://www.bahai.org/persecution/egypt/update |date=2006-10-01 }},  [http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html DWB.sacbee.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053747/http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html |date=2007-10-14 }}</ref> requires all citizens to state their religion\u2014and the only choices are [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], or [[Judaism]] (See [[Egyptian identification card controversy]]).

N. (2018). Annual Report 2017\u20132018.</ref>\n\n== Law and government ==\nIn the politics of some countries, a \"minority\" is an [[ethnic group]] recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized [[minority language]], for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions{{which|date=May 2016}} for minorities include [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Croatia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check \"Other\" on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group.\n\nMany contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for [[race (U.S. Census)|race and ethnicity]] on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. [[Spain]] does not divide its nationals by ethnic group, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages.\n\nSome especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav republic of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see [[nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). However, other minorities such as [[Romani people|Romani]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00421|title=Political recognition of Roma People in Spain.

For example, they may be excluded from political positions, including the presidency.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/2._framework_convention_(monitoring)/2._monitoring_mechanism/4._opinions_of_the_advisory_committee/1._country_specific_opinions/1._first_cycle/PDF_1st_OP_BiH.pdf Opinion of the Council of Europe's Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, in particular paragraphs 37\u201343] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616100431/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/2._framework_convention_(monitoring)/2._monitoring_mechanism/4._opinions_of_the_advisory_committee/1._country_specific_opinions/1._first_cycle/PDF_1st_OP_BiH.pdf |date=2007-06-16 }}</ref>\n\nThere is debate over recognizing minority groups and their privileges. One view<ref>For example, J.A. Lindgren-Alves, member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, speaking at the Committee's 67th Session (Summary Record of the 1724th Meeting, 23 August 2005, CERD/C/SR.1724)</ref> is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European [[nation-state]] model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to [[separatism]] or [[supremacist|supremacism]]. In [[Canada]], some{{who|date=January 2012}} feel that the failure of the dominant [[English language|English]]-speaking majority to integrate [[French Canadians]] has provoked [[Quebec separatism]].\n\nOthers assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalised: for example, [[bilingual education]] may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.<ref>See {{cite book |first=K. |last=Henrard |title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination |location= |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=2000 |pages=218\u2013224 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFF5nzuAze0C&pg=PA218 |isbn=978-9041113597 |access-date=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228001145/https://books.google.com/books?id=QFF5nzuAze0C&pg=PA218 |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Dominant minority]]\n* [[Ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Ethnic penalty]]\n* [[Intangible cultural heritage]]\n* [[Interminority racism]]\n* [[List of active non-governmental organizations of national minorities, indigenous and diasporas|List of active NGOs of national minorities]]\n* [[List of minority political parties]]\n* [[Middleman minority]]\n* [[Minority influence]]\n* [[Minority language]]\n* [[Minority (philosophy)]]\n* [[Minority religion]]\n* [[Minority Rights Group International]]\n* [[Model minority]]\n* [[Serge Moscovici#Minority influence|Serge Moscovici]]\n* [[Social exclusion]]\n* [[Social stratification]]\n* [[Tokenism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.souz-minor.ru Union of Minority Shareholders]\n*[http://www.ecmi.de ECMI - European Centre for Minority Issues]\n*[http://ooiiuu.com Minority language tool]\n*[http://academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/minor01.htm What is a Minority Group?] definitions from Dayton Law School.\n*[http://ambassadors.net/archives/issue19/opinions2.htm From Paris to Cairo: Resistance of the Unacculturated]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081204090551/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/ Minorities at Risk project at the University of Maryland]\n*[http://www.minelres.lv/index.htm MINELRES - Minority Electronic Resources]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061020232654/http://www.eurac.edu/index/ European Academy Bozen/Bolzano (EURAC)]\n*[http://www.eurominority.eu Eurominority - Stateless and national minorities portal]\n*[http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=990 State of the World's Minorities], an annual report by Minority Rights Group International\n*[http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/index.aspx American Psychological Association's Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs]\n{{Ethnicity}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minority Group}}\n[[Category:Voting theory]]\n[[Category:Minorities|*]]\n[[Category:Human rights]]\n[[Category:Disability rights]]\n[[Category:Women's rights]]\n[[Category:Linguistic rights]]\n[[Category:Youth rights]]\n[[Category:Majority\u2013minority relations]]\n", "name_user": "Emily437", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added information from a credible source", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"}

The Crofton family had come to Ireland from England in the sixteenth century and acquired substantial estates in Roscommon. The elder Sir Edward was noted for his loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]] during the [[English Civil War]], and at the [[Restoration of Charles II]] he was rewarded by  being created a  [[baronet]],  the first of the [[Crofton Baronets]]. Little is known for certain of Susanna's background, but there is a tradition in the Crofton family that she  belonged to a junior branch of the family of [[Baron Clifford of Chudleigh]].\n\nTwo years after his father's death in 1675 his mother remarried [[Garrett Dillon]], a prominent [[Roman Catholic]] [[barrister]] who during the reign of the Catholic King [[James II of England]] rose to a position of  political influence in Ireland, and was appointed [[Recorder of Dublin]]. Garrett and his stepson seem to have been estranged by the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and Susanna's death sometime before 1689 broke any  family tie between them.\n\n==After the Glorious Revolution==\n\nWhen James II landed in Ireland, in order to recover  his three kingdoms, Edward's stepfather Garrett Dillon remained loyal to his cause and sat in the so-called [[Patriot Parliament]] of 1689. Edward, described as a young man of \"sturdy and resolute character\", was by contrast  a convinced supporter of the Revolution of 1688. He greatly admired King [[William III of England]], even composing verses in his honour. In consequence the Patriot Parliament [[attainted]] him, and he fled to London with his wife and two young sons; his wife died while they were in England.

The Crofton family had come to Ireland from England in the sixteenth century and acquired substantial estates in Roscommon. The elder Sir Edward was noted for his loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]] during the [[English Civil War]], and at the [[Restoration of Charles II]] he was rewarded by  being created a  [[baronet]],  the first of the [[Crofton Baronets]]. Little is known for certain of Susanna's background, but there is a tradition in the Crofton family that she  belonged to a junior branch of the family of [[Baron Clifford of Chudleigh]].\n\nTwo years after his father's death in 1675 his mother remarried [[Garrett Dillon]], a prominent [[Roman Catholic]] [[barrister]] who during the reign of the Catholic King [[James II of England]] rose to a position of influence   in Ireland, and was appointed [[Recorder of Dublin]]. Garrett and his stepson seem to have been estranged by the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and Susanna's death sometime before 1689 broke any  family tie between them.\n\n==After the Glorious Revolution==\n\nWhen James II landed in Ireland, in order to recover  his three kingdoms, Edward's stepfather Garrett Dillon remained loyal to his cause and sat in the so-called [[Patriot Parliament]] of 1689. Edward, described as a young man of \"sturdy and resolute character\", was by contrast  a convinced supporter of the Revolution of 1688. He greatly admired King [[William III of England]], even composing verses in his honour. In consequence the Patriot Parliament [[attainted]] him, and he fled to London with his wife and two young sons; his wife died while they were in England. After the [[Battle of the Boyne]], which effectively destroyed the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause, Edward's lands were quickly restored to him. By contrast, his stepfather was subject to increasing harassment during the 1690s: he eventually fled the country and died in exile. There is no evidence that Edward interceded on his behalf: possibly  he was taking his revenge on Garrett for voting in the Patriot Parliament to attaint him.\n\nHe was MP for [[Boyle (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Boyle]] in the [[Parliament of Ireland]] of 1695\u201399, and for [[Roscommon County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Roscommon]] from 1703\u20131727.
