Werly remained with the Hayride through the end of 1957.  His first album appeared on [[Trumpet Records]] in the 1950s. Over the years he recorded for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], and [[Savoy Records|Savoy]]. Fairburn also owned a label called [[Milestone Records]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Fairburn's music blended country, blues, and New Orleans rhythm and blues ([[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]). He was popular in New Orleans and in Dallas, where he performed on the [[Big D Jamboree]]. His song \"I Guess I'm Crazy\" was covered by [[Jim Reeves]]. His 1956 single \"Everybody's Rockin'\" is considered a rockabilly classic.

When World War II began, he took a job at a [[New Orleans]] shipyard before enlisting in the U.S. Navy in [[Hawaii]]. When he returned to New Orleans, he considered a singing career, but to make a living he learned how to cut hair. In 1948 he became known as the \"Singing Barber\" when he broadcast on WJBW from his barber shop.<ref name=\"Eder\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Werly Fairburn {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/werly-fairburn-mn0000206658/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Luster\">{{cite web|last1=Luster|first1=J.

Werly remained with the Hayride through the end of 1957.  His first album appeared on [[Trumpet Records]] in the 1950s. Over the years he recorded for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], and [[Savoy Records|Savoy]]. Fairburn also owned a label called [[Milestone Records]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Fairburn's music blended country, blues, and New Orleans rhythm and blues ([[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]). He was popular in New Orleans and in Dallas, where he performed on the [[Big D Jamboree]]. His song \"I Guess I'm Crazy\" was covered by [[Jim Reeves]]. His 1956 single \"Everybody's Rockin'\" is considered a rockabilly classic. Fairburn moved to California in the 1960s and performed until his death in 1985.<ref name=\"Eder\" />\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"450\" | Title\n! width=\"250\" | Label\n|----\n| 1953 || ''Camping with Marie / Let's Live It Over''  || [[Trumpet Records]] No.&nbsp;195\n|----\n| 1953 || ''I Feel Like Cryin' / Baby, Call on Me''   || Trumpet Records No.&nbsp;196\n|----\n| 1954 || ''Good Deal, Lucille / Baby He's a Wolf''   || [[Capitol Records]] #F2270\n|----\n| 1954 || ''Love Spelled Backwards Is Evol / Nothin' But Lovin''   || Capitol Records #F2844\n|----\n| 1954 || ''Prison Cell of Love / I Feel Like Cryin\u2019''   || Capitol Records #F2963\n|----\n| 1955 || ''It's a Cold, Weary World / Spiteful Heart''  || Capitol Records #F3101\n|----\n| 1955 || ''I Guess I'm Crazy (For Loving You) / That Sweet Love of Mine''  || [[Columbia Records]] No.&nbsp;21432\n|----\n| 1956 || ''Broken Hearted Me / Stay Close to Me''  || Columbia Records No.&nbsp;21483\n|----\n| 1956 || ''Everybody's Rockin' / It's Heaven''  || Columbia Records No.&nbsp;21528\n|----\n| 1956 || ''All the Time / I'm a Fool About Your Love''  || [[Savoy Records]] No.&nbsp;1503 \n|----\n| 1957 || ''My Heart's on Fire / Speak to Me Baby''  || Savoy Records No.&nbsp;1509\n|----\n| 1957 || ''Telephone Baby / No Blues Tomorrow''  || Savoy Records No.&nbsp;1521\n|----\n| 1962 || ''You Are My Sunshine / Doggone That Moon''  || [[Milestone Records]] No.&nbsp;2013\n|----\n| 1968 || ''My Crazy World / There's Something On''  || [[Paula Records]] No.&nbsp;295\n|----\n| || \n* ''A Little Bit of Nothing''\n* ''Won't It Be Nice''\n|| Capitol Records (not issued)\n|----\n| ||\n* ''I'm Jealous''\n|| Columbia Records (not issued)\n|----\n| ||\n* ''All By Myself'' (live)\n* ''I've Got Nothing But Love''\n* ''Old Memories Come Back''\n|| not issued\n|}\n\n==Notes==\nAll singles before Milestone 2013 were issued as 78 rpm and 45 rpm records with the same issue numbers.
