It was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on September 6, 2017, followed by a [[Microsoft Windows]] version the following month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.glixel.com/news/bungie-embraces-pc-with-destiny-2-w483017|title=Bungie Embraces PC With 'Destiny 2'|last=Weber|first=Rachel|date=May 18, 2017|work=Glixel|access-date=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Schreier|first1=Jason|title=Destiny 2 Officially Revealed, Confirmed For PC|date=March 30, 2017|url=http://kotaku.com/destiny-2-officially-revealed-confirmed-for-pc-1793838721|website=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> The game was published by [[Activision]] until December 31 2018 <ref>https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/718877/000071887719000015/atvi-6302019x10xq.htm</ref>, when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' and its [[Destiny post-release content|subsequent expansions]]. Set in a \"[[science fantasy|mythic science fiction]]\" world, the game features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] games. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\" and six-player [[Raid (gaming)|raids]]. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events as well as new activities not featured in the original. These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with [[non-player characters]] (NPCs); the original ''Destiny'' only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional [[deathmatch]] game modes.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the Last City from different alien races. One of these races, the Cabal, led by the warlord Dominus Ghaul, assault the Last City and strip all Guardians of their Light. The player sets out on a journey to regain their Light and find a way to defeat Ghaul and his Red Legion army and take back the Last City. Like the original ''Destiny'', the game features [[expansion packs]] which further the story and adds new content and missions. Year One of ''Destiny 2'' featured two small expansions, ''[[Destiny 2: Curse of Osiris|Curse of Osiris]]'' in December 2017 and ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'' in May 2018. A third, large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released in September 2018, beginning Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into ''Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection''. An [[Destiny 2 post-release content#Annual Pass|annual pass]] was also available alongside this release, containing three premium content drops for Year Two. Year Three began with the large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|Shadowkeep]]'' in October 2019. It is a standalone release, not requiring the previous expansions to play. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of ''Destiny 2'' called \"New Light\", a [[free-to-play]] re-release of ''Destiny 2'' and the first two expansions.\n\nUpon release, ''Destiny 2'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game received praise for its many improvements over its predecessor. The original ''Destiny'' received much criticism for its story, but ''Destiny 2'' was praised as having a \"more robust story\" and an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/><ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> As with the original, gameplay for the most part was also highly praised. Reviews were split on the recategorization of the weapons and the newer activities like the Adventures and Lost Sectors, but praise was unanimous on the exploration of the game world. Changes to PvP were welcomed by some reviewers, though others were critical for the mode lacking player choice. ''Destiny 2'' was nominated for and won various awards, such as at [[The Game Awards 2017]] and [[Game Critics Awards]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Destiny 2 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Destiny 2'' allows players, known in the game as guardians, to utilize weaponry and special powers alongside other guardians. Here a guardian defends against enemies while another guardian uses their powers to cast a shield made of void energy.]]\n{{see also|Destiny (video game)#Gameplay}}\nSimilar to its predecessor, ''Destiny 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]] game that incorporates [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO) elements.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\">{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Bungie Reveals its Destiny in This Documentary|url=http://kotaku.com/5984863/bungie-reveals-its-destiny-in-this-documentary|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The original ''Destiny'' includes on-the-fly [[Matchmaking (video games)|matchmaking]] that allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were \"matched\" by the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players had to use their respective console's messaging system.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\"/> ''Destiny 2'' features a more optimal way of matchmaking called \"Guided Games\", which allows players to search for [[Video gaming clan|clans]] who may need additional players for activities, such as [[Dungeon crawl|strikes]] or [[raid (gaming)|raids]]. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6449086/|title=Destiny 2: Everything We Know So Far|date=May 17, 2017|last1=Espineli|first1=Matt|last2=Plagge|first2=Kallie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Character progression and classes ===\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Character progression and classes}}\nAs in the original game, players are able to improve their characters, referred to as Guardians, by gaining [[experience point]]s (EXP) \u2014 when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will \"level up\" and gain improved [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] which further enhance performance in battle. [[Quest (video gaming)|Milestones]], including the \"main scenario\" milestones, are specific tasks given to the player by [[non-player characters]] (NPCs) which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario milestones progresses the overarching plot of the game.\n\n''Destiny 2'' features the same three character classes as the original ''Destiny''. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. The three classes are Warlock, Hunter, and Titan. After choosing a class, players select one of three species for their character: Human, Awoken (bluish-gray-skinned descendants of Humans), or Exo (humanoid machines). They can then customize their character, such as changing its gender or skin color. A character's species is cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. Players can create two more characters to have a character of each class.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-26-destiny-2-classes-subclasses-titan-hunter-warlock-4747|title=Destiny 2 classes and subclasses - all new Titan, Hunter, and Warlock skills and supers explained|date=May 26, 2017|last=Tapsell|first=Chris|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Hunters continue to have access to the Solar-based \"Gunslinger\" sub-class from the original game and the Void-based \"Nightstalker\" sub-class from the original's ''[[Destiny: The Taken King|The Taken King]]'' expansion, both with gameplay changes. The Hunter's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Arc-based \"Arcstrider\", replacing the \"Bladedancer\" sub-class of the original. Arcstrider's super, \"Arc Staff\", focuses on an electrified staff and a large amount of rapid mobility.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' adds three new supers for each of the Hunter sub-classes: \"Blade Barrage\" for Gunslingers, focusing on throwing a volley of flaming knives; \"Spectral Blades\" for Nightstalkers, allowing players to see through walls and attack with Void daggers; and \"Whirling Guard\" for Arcstriders, which allows players to block projectiles by spinning their Arc Staff.\n*Warlocks continue to have access to the Void-based \"Voidwalker\" sub-class from the original game and the Arc-based \"Stormcaller\" sub-class from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with several changes. The Warlock's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Solar-based \"Dawnblade\" with a super called \"Daybreak\", replacing the \"Sunsinger\" sub-class of the original. The Daybreak super allows the player to make Solar Light blades to strike enemies from mid-air.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' gives Warlocks three new supers: \"Nova Warp\" for Voidwalkers, allowing players to warp around the battlefield and unleash a Void explosion; \"Chaos Reach\" for Stormcallers, which unleashes a beam of Arc energy which can be turned off at any time to conserve Super energy; and \"Well of Radiance\" for Dawnblades, allowing players to create a healing and empowering aura for players to stand in.\n*Titans continue to have access to the Arc-based \"Striker\" sub-class from the original game and the Solar-based \"Sunbreaker\" from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with significant gameplay changes. The Titan's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Void-based \"Sentinel\", replacing the \"Defender\" sub-class of the original, although the Sentinel sub-class can create the Defender's Ward of Dawn shielding bubble if this option is selected. Sentinel's super, \"Sentinel Shield\", allows the player to summon a shield that can block enemy fire and be used offensively (similar to [[Captain America's shield]]).<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' added three new supers for Titans: \"Thundercrash\" for Strikers, allowing players to launch into the air and slam onto the ground; \"Burning Maul\" for Sunbreakers, which players wield a large hammer than can unleash flaming tornadoes; and \"Banner Shield\" for Sentinels, which unleashes a protective barrier that allows other players to shoot through.\n\nUpon reaching the character EXP level cap (level 20 at launch, expanded to 50), character progression shifts to improving their \"Power\" level (formerly \"Light\" level) by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources, including \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\", [[raid (gaming)|raids]], and in-game events. The three weapon classes and five pieces of armor each have a Power level; a character's Power level is the average of that gear. A higher character level allows for better equipment with higher Power levels to be equipped. A higher Power level improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable Power level at launch was 305 and is expanded to 600. Weapons and armor were reorganized in ''Destiny 2''. In the original game, weapons were divided as Primary, Special, and Heavy weapons. At launch, the weapons were categorized as Kinetic, Energy, and Power weapons. Primary weapons and some Special weapons in the original \u2013 such as hand cannons and sidearms \u2013 are classified as Kinetic and Energy weapons. Those without an elemental damage type go in the Kinetic weapons slot while those with an elemental damage type (Arc, Solar, or Void) go in the Energy weapons slot. Power weapons include the Heavy weapons and the more powerful Special weapons from the first game, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, as well as new weapon types, such as the grenade launcher. As of ''Forsaken'', the weapons system was overhauled, with many Power weapons, such as most shotguns, single-shot grenade launchers, and most sniper rifles, being reorganized into Kinetic and Energy weapons slots. With armor, the name of the stats have been changed. Instead of Strength, Intellect, and Discipline, there are stats for Resilience, Recovery, and Mobility. Also for armor, the helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, and class item slots have remained unchanged, but the artifacts slot has been replaced with one for a player's clan banners.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-09-destiny-2-gameplay-beta-features-4747|title=Destiny 2 gameplay changes, beta, release date and everything else we know so far|date=June 9, 2017|last=Reynolds|first=Matthew|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Player versus environment (PvE) ===\nLike the original game, player versus environment game types make up the majority of the game. Areas to explore include [[Earth]]'s European Dead Zone (which was only represented by PvP maps in the original), [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur planet]] [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]]. The ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion adds [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as an explorable area, while the ''Warmind'' expansion adds [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]]. ''Forsaken'' adds two new explorable areas in the Reef: the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City, the latter being the mysterious sanctuary of the Awoken race and an end-game area that is accessible after completing the campaign of ''Forsaken''. The newest expansion, Shadowkeep, adds the Moon as a playable area. There is also a new social space in the European Dead Zone called \"The Farm\", as the main portion of the Tower of the original was destroyed at the start of ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s campaign. However, a lower, undamaged portion of the Tower becomes the main social space post-campaign. Like the original, there are Patrol missions and public events, but emphasis has been placed more on exploration of the worlds, including towns that players can visit and friendly NPCs who can be found in-game and will give side-quests. New missions were added called \"Adventures\", which allow players to explore the area and go on a treasure hunt-like journey to dungeon-like areas. Some Adventures culminate in what is called a Lost Sector, which are somewhat hidden areas in worlds that lead players to a boss that yields rewards upon its defeat. Lost Sectors can be found and accessed without doing an Adventure. Starting with the ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion, Heroic Adventures were added, which are harder versions of Adventures and they rotate each week. A map has also been added to the game, which shows the locations of the NPCs, Adventures, Heroic Adventures, Region Chests, and Lost Sectors. The maps of these new areas are much larger than those in the original ''Destiny'', with one being described as twice as large as any area of the original. Players no longer have to leave a planet and go to orbit to travel to another location; they can now do so immediately from their current in-game location.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Another new activity has been added called Flashpoints, which is a weekly milestone that takes place on one of the eight locations and rotates each week. Players complete public events, loot Lost Sectors and complete Heroic Adventures to earn high level rewards.<ref name=\"D2Flashpoint\">{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-flashpoints-weekly/|title=Destiny 2 Has A New Weekly Activity Called 'Flashpoints'|date=June 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}</ref> Similar to the original game, players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions \u2014 Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy. In ''Destiny 2'', however, the factions now compete against each other in the Faction Rally, which is a periodic event that lasts for one week. Faction points are earned by doing various activities. The faction with the most points at the end of the week earns a high level reward for 1,000 Glimmer (in-game currency). The losing factions can also gain the reward, but must pay 50,000 Glimmer for their faction's item.<ref name=\"FactionRally\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/22/destiny-2-bungie-explains-new-faction-rally-event|title=Destiny 2: Bungie Explains New Faction Rally Event|date=September 22, 2017|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOnce a player has completed the main story and has reached the level cap (currently 50), they unlock access to different types of end-game content. These activities include Nightfall strikes (a weekly featured strike with modifiers and high level rewards; as of the ''Forsaken'' expansion, players can choose one of three featured strikes), a strike playlist with modifiers, a Daily Heroic Story playlist, the \"Leviathan\" and \"Last Wish\" raids, the \"Eater of Worlds\" and \"Spire of Stars\" raid lairs, and the \"Escalation Protocol\" and \"Blind Well\" horde activities on Mars and the Dreaming City, respectively, among other PvP activities. A harder difficulty mode called \"Prestige\" is available for the Leviathan raid its raid lairs, with modifiers; there are no plans for a Prestige mode for Last Wish. These end-game activities reward players with powerful gear upon successful completion to increase their Power level.<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/8/16274074/destiny-2-dlc-curse-of-osiris-expansion-leak-mercury</ref>\nIn Destiny 2 Forsaken, they added new special abilities like Daybreak and other abilities.\n\n=== Player versus player (PvP) ===\nLike the original, player versus player combat exists in what is called the Crucible with Lord Shaxx returning as its NPC. The original ''Destiny''{{'}}s Crucible featured six-versus-six and three-versus-three game modes, as well as a limited time two-versus-two mode. At launch, all game modes were four-versus-four as Bungie shifted their focus to smaller teams for competitive multiplayer and better map design, but Quickplay modes eventually became six-versus-six. Like the original, player statistics such as weapon power and defense are balanced between players in Crucible game modes. The in-game [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] was updated so that players can see if an enemy has their super charged or has power ammo. Currently, players have the option to choose between four rotating playlists, rumble (a six player 1v1v1v1v1v1 gamemode) survival and freelance survival (A version of survival where players cannot choose the teammates on their team), classic mix, and private matches.\n\nTrials of Osiris from the original game was replaced by Trials of the Nine. Like Trials of Osiris, Trials of the Nine begins on Fridays and ends with the weekly reset on Tuesdays. The game mode for this new Trials, however, has changed; instead of using the Elimination mode of the original, Trials of the Nine rotates each week between ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s two new game modes, Countdown and Survival. Only one map is featured for Trials' four-day duration, but the map also rotates weekly. Player's gear is locked during Trials, meaning they cannot change it for the duration of a match. Unlike Trials of Osiris, players can gain access to the Trials of the Nine's social space called The Spire, located in unknown space, for completing a match of Trials and earning Trials tokens. There, players will meet an NPC called the Emissary of the Nine, who will exchange tokens for gear. Gaining three, five, and seven wins on the score card, respectively, gains access to the upper tiers of the social space with greater rewards at each tier. Going flawless with seven wins allows admittance into an exclusive area with even greater rewards. Three losses resets the score card. To access Trials of the Nine, players must have completed the campaign, completed Lord Shaxx's \"Call to Arms\" milestone, and have a Power level of at least 260.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-trials-of-the-nine-mode-date/|title=Destiny 2 Details Trials of the Nine Debut [UPDATED]|date=September 8, 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-what-is-trials-of-the-nine-how-to-get-st/1100-6453377/|title=Destiny 2: What Is Trials Of The Nine? How To Get Started|date=September 15, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref> Trials of the nine has been put on permanent hiatus, but a new trials game mode has been speculated heavily. Recently on 2/26/20 Bungie released the reveal trailer for the next season (season of the worthy) as well as revealing that trials of osiris will be returning as a part of this dlc. It has been confirmed that Trials of Osiris will be released on 3/13/20. However, instead of the usual 9 wins without losing to go flawless, the new gamemode will only require 7 wins.\n\nThe periodic competitive Iron Banner PvP mode of the original game, which disabled balancing of player's gear, also returned for the sequel. ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s Iron Banner, however, does not disable balancing, with Bungie stating that \"Your fighting abilities, not your power levels, will decide the outcome\". This was changed following the release of ''Forsaken'', with balancing becoming disabled like the original game. Like the original, Iron Banner lasts for one week and features milestones to complete daily. Players must have completed the campaign and be level 20 to access Iron Banner, which features the returning Lord Saladin from the original game as its NPC.<ref name=\"D2IronBanner\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-iron-banner-gear-rewards-when-it-starts-/1100-6453830/|title=Destiny 2: Iron Banner Gear Rewards, When It Starts, What's New, And How To Access It|date=October 7, 2017|last1=Pereira|first1=Chris|last2=Makuch|first2=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA new PvP mode that was added in the ''Forsaken'' expansion is called Gambit, a best-of-three rounds mode that combines both PvE and PvP, featuring the Drifter as its NPC. A 24-hour free trial of the mode was made available to all players on September 1, 2018, three days prior to the launch of ''Forsaken''. Two teams of four players compete against each other by defeating PvE enemies. Enemies, when defeated, drop motes which players can pick up and deposit in a bank in the center of the arena. Depositing 5, 10 or 15 motes send small, medium or large enemy blockers, respectively, to the opposing team's arena and locks their bank; the opposing team must defeat the blockers in order to reactivate their bank. Every 25 motes deposited opens a portal where one team member can invade the other team's arena. Defeating members of the opposing team drops any motes that they are carrying. After depositing a certain amount of motes, a boss will spawn in the middle of the arena; if a team member is defeated by an invading member of the opposing team, the boss regains health. The first team that defeats their boss wins the round.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Setting}}\nOne year after the [[Destiny: Rise of Iron#Plot|SIVA Crisis]], Cabal forces of the Red Legion launch an aerial assault on the Last City, destroying the main portion of the Tower, the headquarters of the Guardians. The player's Guardian and their Ghost respond by assisting the Vanguard in assaulting the Red Legion command ship. As they confront the Red Legion's commander, Dominus Ghaul, his forces attach a device to the Traveler and begin draining it of the Light, the power used by the Guardians. The Guardian loses their powers and is nearly killed by Ghaul. Waking two days after the attack, the Guardian locates their Ghost. They find a haven known as \"the Farm\" in the European Dead Zone (EDZ) with the assistance of Suraya Hawthorne, a non-Guardian human from the outskirts of the Last City.\n\nThe Guardian follows a vision to encounter a shard of the Traveler hidden in a forest within the EDZ. Ghost interfaces with the shard and both its and the Guardian's Light are restored. After restoring long range communications, Hawthorne intercepts a distress call from Commander Zavala, urging surviving Guardians to travel to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and assist in mounting a counter-offensive. Against Hawthorne's objections, the Guardian travels to Titan, which has been overrun by the Hive. With assistance from Deputy Commander Sloane, they learn that the Red Legion was dispatched to the [[Milky Way]] in response to a distress call sent during the [[Destiny: The Taken King#Plot|Taken War]] two years prior, and that Ghaul possesses a superweapon known as the Almighty, a space station capable of destroying stars. Resistance to Cabal rule has resulted in entire star systems being destroyed. The intelligence also reveals that the Almighty is positioned near the Sun, breaking up the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as fuel. Zavala tasks the Guardian to find Ikora Rey and Cayde-6 to assist in a counterattack to retake the Last City. During this time, it is shown that Ghaul, aided by his mentor, the Consul, overthrew Emperor Calus and took control of the Cabal, and has been studying the Traveler in order to learn how to use the Light and legitimize himself as Emperor.\n\nThe Guardian locates Cayde-6 on the centaur planet [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]], which has almost been completely transformed by the Vex. With the aid of Failsafe, an AI from the crashed starship ''Exodus Black'', the Guardian frees Cayde from a Vex portal loop, and claims a teleporter for use in taking back the City. Cayde directs the Guardian to find Ikora on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] moon of [[Io (moon)|Io]], where she had gone to find answers about the Traveler. Ikora and Io researcher Asher Mir directs the Guardian to locate a Warmind, an ancient defensive AI for intelligence on the Almighty. Afterwards, the Vanguard reunites at the Farm and conclude that the only way to retake the Last City and save the Traveler is to shut down the Almighty first, eliminating the possibility of it destroying the Sun. The Guardian boards the Almighty and destroys the weapon, signaling Zavala to begin the counterattack. As the Vanguard begins the assault, the Consul admonishes Ghaul for his obsession with the Traveler, and urges him to take the Light; Ghaul is reluctant until the Consul kills the Speaker, whom Ghaul had captured and tortured to try and learn more about the Traveler. Ghaul then proclaims that he will take the Light, and strangles the Consul in a fit of rage.\n\nThe Guardian returns to Earth to assist in the counterattack and infiltrates Ghaul's command ship alone to save the Traveler. Ghaul forcibly takes the Light, corrupting it, and uses its power against the Guardian, but the Guardian is successful in defeating Ghaul. Ghaul reemerges as a massive ethereal figure who then speaks to the Traveler directly. In doing so, the Traveler wakes from its long sleep, destroying the device that was harvesting its power and killing Ghaul. It sends a massive shockwave, restoring the Light and decimating the Red Legion's forces. The game ends with a posthumous voiceover from the Speaker, reminding all that the Light can never be stopped. The Guardian and Ghost convene with Zavala, Ikora, Cayde, and Hawthorne at an undamaged portion of the Tower, with the Vanguard returning to their old duties and Hawthorne assuming a new post there. In a post-credits scene, the shockwave sent by the Traveler is shown reaching the entire system. The wave of Light extends beyond the Solar System and spreads beyond the Milky Way, before panning across a fleet of dark, unknown ships sitting some distance away in extragalactic space.\n\nFollowing Ghaul's defeat, a massive Cabal ship called the Leviathan appears in orbit of Nessus, under the control of the exiled Emperor Calus.

There was also a timed-exclusive Crucible map for PS4 players called Wormhaven. Instead of an entirely new raid, a feature called raid lair was added, featuring new areas to the existing Leviathan raid and a different final boss.<ref name=\"ExpansionI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-curse-of-osiris-dlc-increases-the-level-/1100-6454529/|title=Destiny 2 Curse Of Osiris DLC Increases The Level Cap|date=October 31, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> The second expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'', was released on May 8, 2018 and focuses on the Warmind Rasputin from the original game. This expansion takes players to the planet Mars in a new area called [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas Basin]]. The expansion also features a new mode called \"Escalation Protocol\", a horde mode which can be started by any player in the patrol mode on Mars. As well, the EXP level cap was raised to 30 and the Power level cap was raised to 380. In addition to Rasputin, a new character named Ana Bray (also from the lore of the original ''Destiny'') was added, who serves as the primary NPC on Mars. Like the previous expansion, ''Warmind'' also includes a second raid lair on the Leviathan. The expansion also added progressive ranking systems for PvP, titled Valor and Glory. Players earn Valor in quickplay matches while Glory is earned in competitive matches, with each new rank earning greater rewards. Valor points are earned regardless of win or loss, while Glory points are earned by wins but reduced by losses.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Both expansions featured timed-exclusive content for the PlayStation 4 platform, which became available for other platforms in late 2019.\n\nThe game saw many seasonal events during its first year of service, which were free to all players regardless of which version of the game they owned. \"The Dawning\" holiday event from the original ''Destiny'' returned on December 19, 2017 and ended on January 9, 2018. Both social spaces were redecorated for the event along with snow weather. Players could create snowballs in the social spaces and during strikes and throw these at other players or enemies (which damaged enemies). The Crucible game mode \"Mayhem\" (all abilities restore rapidly) was also brought back from the original ''Destiny''. New Milestones with event-themed rewards were also added.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-holiday-event-is-now-playable-on-ps4-xb/1100-6455748/|title=Destiny 2's Holiday Event Is Now Playable On PS4, Xbox One, And PC|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=December 19, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"Crimson Days\", the [[Valentine's Day]]-themed event from Year 2 (2016) of the original ''Destiny'', returned for ''Destiny 2'' on February 13, 2018, and like the original, it ran for only one week. Just as in the original event, Crimson Days featured a 2-versus-2 Crucible mode\u2013the only in ''Destiny 2''\u2013however, the mode was modified from the original. Staying close to a teammate caused all abilities to recharge quicker, while being apart gave away both players' locations to the opposing team. Players could earn Crimson Engrams, granting new rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crimson-days-launches-with-new-update-on/1100-6456750/|title=Destiny 2 Crimson Days Launches With New Update On PC, PS4, And Xbox One|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=February 13, 2018|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=February 13, 2018}}</ref> Crimson Days was later rebranded into a separate but permanent mode called \"Doubles\" as a rotating mode in the Crucible. A brand new summer event called \"Solstice of Heroes\" began on July 31, 2018 and ended on August 28, 2018, to commemorate the first year of the game. The Power level cap was raised to 400 for the event. A new NPC called the Statue of Heroes was added and provided bounties that, when turned in, awarded Moments of Triumph points for players which could be used to earn exclusive rewards. Players received \"Scorched\" armor pieces at Power level 240 at the start of the event, which could then be upgraded to \"Rekindled\" armor at Power level 340, then to \"Resplendent\" armor at Power level 400, all by completing specific requirements for each armor piece, including playing through 5 revamped (Redux) missions from the original ''Destiny 2'' campaign. Players could also earn Solstice Engrams, which also granted new rewards.\n\nThe third expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released on September 4, 2018, beginning Year 2 of ''Destiny 2''. Similar to the original [[Destiny: The Taken King|''Destiny''{{'}}s ''The Taken King'']] expansion, ''Forsaken'' had a large overhaul on gameplay, though not to the extent that ''The Taken King'' had with the original ''Destiny''. A large expansion, the story has a \"western revenge\" theme, according to Bungie. A large portion of the expansion takes place in the Reef's Tangled Shore, including a new raid called \"Last Wish\", which takes place in the end-game area, the Dreaming City, also located in the Reef. The developers claimed that it has more bosses than any previous raid (including from the original game) with a massive roam area, puzzles, and the raid changes over time based on players' actions in the raid itself. There is also a new mode called Gambit that combines PvE and PvP, and features its own ranking system called Infamy, which works similar to the Crucible's Valor ranking system. Two teams of four players compete against each other while facing PvE enemies. A new weapon type, a bow and arrow, was also added. The EXP level cap was raised to 50 and the Power level cap was raised to 600.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-release-date-new-mode-trail/1100-6459402/|title=Destiny 2 Forsaken DLC Release Date, New Mode, Trailer, And More Details|date=June 6, 2018|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> A trailer displayed during Sony's E3 2018 press conference showed the death of Cayde-6 by the hands of the returning Prince Uldren Sov.

The expansion sees players return to the [[Moon]], an area that was featured in the first ''Destiny'' game. The location was reprised and expanded upon with Bungie claiming it to be twice the size of the original location from ''Destiny''.<ref name=\"Gilliam\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/17/18679445/destiny-2-shadowkeep-moon-black-garden-artifact-gate-lord-armor-2-0-pvp-crota-exotic-finishing-move|title=Everything we know is coming to Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|last=Gilliam|first=Ryan|date=2019-06-17|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> The story of ''Shadowkeep'' sees the return of Eris Morn, a character from the first game who has been absent since the events of ''Destiny 2''. Eris seeks the help of the player character in defeating \"Nightmares\" that she released into the solar system, which are manifestations of the Guardians' past. Guardians face off against their previous adversaries, which are being resurrected by the Darkness. Throughout the story, Eris and the Guardians work together to figure out the cause of this unleashed madness and do what they can to put a stop to it.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bungie|title=Bungie ViDoc - Out of the Shadows|date=2019-06-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVk4PkTG99o|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> The expansion includes a return to the Black Garden on Mars for a new 6 player raid, ''Garden Of Salvation''.<ref name=\"Gilliam\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PS4: 85/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/destiny-2 |title=Destiny 2 for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref><br />XONE: 87/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/destiny-2 |title=Destiny 2 for Xbox One Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref><br />PC: 83/100<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/destiny-2 |title=Destiny 2 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 7.5/10<ref name=\"DestructoidReview\">{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Chris |date=September 11, 2017 |url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-destiny-2-459702.phtml |title=Review: Destiny 2 |website=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGMReview\">{{cite magazine |last=Slead |first=Evan |date=September 14, 2017 |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/destiny-2-review |title=Destiny 2 review |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |accessdate=September 14, 2017}}</ref>\n| GI = 9/10<ref name=\"GIReview\">{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Matt |date=September 15, 2017 |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/destiny_2/b/playstation4/archive/2017/09/15/game-informer-review-destiny-2.aspx |title=A Streamlined Future - Destiny 2 - PlayStation 4 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n| GameRev = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRevReview\">{{cite web |last=Perez |first=Cody |date=September 13, 2017 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/347609-destiny-2-final-review-what-destiny-shouldve-been |title=Destiny 2 Final Review \u2013 What Destiny Should've Been |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"GSpotReview\">{{cite web |last=Plagge |first=Kallie |date=September 15, 2017 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/ |title=Destiny 2 Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n| GRadar = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GRadarReview\">{{cite web |last=Houghton |first=David |date=September 15, 2017 |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2-review/ |title=Destiny 2 review: 'This isn't Destiny.

Although he said the variety of weapons were fun, the Kinetic weapons \"didn't seem to pack as much of a punch as their Energy [weapon] counterparts.\"<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Cody Perez of ''[[Game Revolution]]'', however, welcomed the recategorized weapons, saying they were less restrictive and said that \"Bungie are masters of gun-play\".<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Kallie Plagge of [[GameSpot]] said that the game features mostly the same structure as the original, including its \"mechanically excellent shooting and satisfying loot grind\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/> Carter praised the Lost Sectors and public events, as well as the additional story quests and Adventures post-campaign.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Miller said that the Lost Sectors were fun, but they became less interesting with the more that were done.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez, however, was not a fan of the Adventures and Lost Sectors activities, saying they were a \"disconnect [from] the main campaign\". He said that they were filler content, and that they were \"monotonous and a bore to accomplish, lacking the heart that fills the campaign.\" He did praise the public events as they are only periodic.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/>\n\nThe Leviathan raid received praise and criticism. Miller of ''Game Informer'' stated that the Leviathan raid was \"one of Bungie's most intricate and fascinating environments to date\", praising its maze-like structure with hidden chests and secret passages. He was critical of the award system, however, stating that it \"separates the excitement of new gear from the moment of victory\", as it does not offer most loot until a full completion.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Slead of ''EGM'' said that \"the bread and butter of ''Destiny'' is still these post-campaign quests\", also referring to Strikes and the weekly Nightfall activity.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'', who did not play any of the original game's raids, was a big fan of the Leviathan raid, stating that it exceeded its hype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/348153-destiny-2-leviathan-raid-review-exceeds-hype|title=Destiny 2's Leviathan Raid Exceeds the Hype|date=September 13, 2017|last=Perez|first=Cody|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> Plagge of GameSpot said that \"solving [the raid's] often obscure puzzles can be both rewarding and frustrating\", but \"each failure teaches you something new\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nThe original ''Destiny'' was largely criticized for its story. ''Destiny 2'', however, was praised for its improvements to the story and easier access to the universe's lore. Slead of ''EGM'' said that it has a \"more robust story\" and Bungie fixed the \"meandering storytelling from the first\".<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Carter of ''Destructoid'' said that although its story was similar to others in the same genre, \"it's easy to follow and even easier to get invested in, with the game's cast coming front and center.\"<ref name=\"DestructoidReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' said that the story \"[gripped] me in a way that only Bungie's former series ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' was able to.\" He said that there were many moments that were of shock and awe, and that the game had a meaningful narrative with an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Plagge of GameSpot said that the story serves its main purpose and that its strength \"lie in atmosphere and side details\", while also praising its \"mournful soundtrack\" as fantastic.<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nMiller of ''Game Informer'' praised the Crucible mode for feeling more competitive than the original ''Destiny''{{'}}s, with teamwork being \"highly valued\". However, Miller was \"perplexed by the decision to force players into one of two playlists\", instead of letting them choose. He was also indifferent to the change of making all modes four-versus-four, but said that \"the compact group size demands everyone pull their weight, which is great.\"<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' was disappointed that Crucible did not receive \"the same love that the singleplayer had been given.\" He said that although the smaller map sizes were not a bad thing, it causes multiplayer to be non-stop action, not allowing players to take a moment to strategize.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> David Houghton of ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' said that the changes to the Crucible

It was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on September 6, 2017, followed by a [[Microsoft Windows]] version the following month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.glixel.com/news/bungie-embraces-pc-with-destiny-2-w483017|title=Bungie Embraces PC With 'Destiny 2'|last=Weber|first=Rachel|date=May 18, 2017|work=Glixel|access-date=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Schreier|first1=Jason|title=Destiny 2 Officially Revealed, Confirmed For PC|date=March 30, 2017|url=http://kotaku.com/destiny-2-officially-revealed-confirmed-for-pc-1793838721|website=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> The game was published by [[Activision]] until December 31 2018 <ref>https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/718877/000071887719000015/atvi-6302019x10xq.htm</ref>, when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' and its [[Destiny post-release content|subsequent expansions]]. Set in a \"[[science fantasy|mythic science fiction]]\" world, the game features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] games. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\" and six-player [[Raid (gaming)|raids]]. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events as well as new activities not featured in the original. These new activities have an emphasis on exploration of the planets and interactions with [[non-player characters]] (NPCs); the original ''Destiny'' only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional [[deathmatch]] game modes.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the Last City from different alien races. One of these races, the Cabal, led by the warlord Dominus Ghaul, assault the Last City and strip all Guardians of their Light. The player sets out on a journey to regain their Light and find a way to defeat Ghaul and his Red Legion army and take back the Last City. Like the original ''Destiny'', the game features [[expansion packs]] which further the story and adds new content and missions. Year One of ''Destiny 2'' featured two small expansions, ''[[Destiny 2: Curse of Osiris|Curse of Osiris]]'' in December 2017 and ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'' in May 2018. A third, large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released in September 2018, beginning Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into ''Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection''. An [[Destiny 2 post-release content#Annual Pass|annual pass]] was also available alongside this release, containing three premium content drops for Year Two. Year Three began with the large expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|Shadowkeep]]'' in October 2019. It is a standalone release, not requiring the previous expansions to play. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of ''Destiny 2'' called \"New Light\", a [[free-to-play]] re-release of ''Destiny 2'' and the first two expansions.\n\nUpon release, ''Destiny 2'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. The game received praise for its many improvements over its predecessor. The original ''Destiny'' received much criticism for its story, but ''Destiny 2'' was praised as having a \"more robust story\" and an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/><ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> As with the original, gameplay for the most part was also highly praised. Reviews were split on the recategorization of the weapons and the newer activities like the Adventures and Lost Sectors, but praise was unanimous on the exploration of the game world. Changes to PvP were welcomed by some reviewers, though others were critical for the mode lacking player choice. ''Destiny 2'' was nominated for and won various awards, such as at [[The Game Awards 2017]] and [[Game Critics Awards]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Destiny 2 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Destiny 2'' allows players, known in the game as guardians, to utilize weaponry and special powers alongside other guardians. Here a guardian defends against enemies while another guardian uses their powers to cast a shield made of void energy.]]\n{{see also|Destiny (video game)#Gameplay}}\nSimilar to its predecessor, ''Destiny 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]] game that incorporates [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] and [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMO) elements.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\">{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Bungie Reveals its Destiny in This Documentary|url=http://kotaku.com/5984863/bungie-reveals-its-destiny-in-this-documentary|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}</ref> The original ''Destiny'' includes on-the-fly [[Matchmaking (video games)|matchmaking]] that allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were \"matched\" by the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players had to use their respective console's messaging system.<ref name=\"Kotaku Destiny Reveal\"/> ''Destiny 2'' features a more optimal way of matchmaking called \"Guided Games\", which allows players to search for [[Video gaming clan|clans]] who may need additional players for activities, such as [[Dungeon crawl|strikes]] or [[raid (gaming)|raids]]. Like the original, activities in ''Destiny 2'' are divided among [[player versus environment]] (PvE) and [[player versus player]] (PvP) game types.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6449086/|title=Destiny 2: Everything We Know So Far|date=May 17, 2017|last1=Espineli|first1=Matt|last2=Plagge|first2=Kallie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Character progression and classes ===\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Character progression and classes}}\nAs in the original game, players are able to improve their characters, referred to as Guardians, by gaining [[experience point]]s (EXP) \u2014 when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will \"level up\" and gain improved [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] which further enhance performance in battle. [[Quest (video gaming)|Milestones]], including the \"main scenario\" milestones, are specific tasks given to the player by [[non-player characters]] (NPCs) which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario milestones progresses the overarching plot of the game.\n\n''Destiny 2'' features the same three character classes as the original ''Destiny''. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. The three classes are Warlock, Hunter, and Titan. After choosing a class, players select one of three species for their character: Human, Awoken (bluish-gray-skinned descendants of Humans), or Exo (humanoid machines). They can then customize their character, such as changing its gender or skin color. A character's species is cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. Players can create two more characters to have a character of each class.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-26-destiny-2-classes-subclasses-titan-hunter-warlock-4747|title=Destiny 2 classes and subclasses - all new Titan, Hunter, and Warlock skills and supers explained|date=May 26, 2017|last=Tapsell|first=Chris|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n*Hunters continue to have access to the Solar-based \"Gunslinger\" sub-class from the original game and the Void-based \"Nightstalker\" sub-class from the original's ''[[Destiny: The Taken King|The Taken King]]'' expansion, both with gameplay changes. The Hunter's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Arc-based \"Arcstrider\", replacing the \"Bladedancer\" sub-class of the original. Arcstrider's super, \"Arc Staff\", focuses on an electrified staff and a large amount of rapid mobility.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' adds three new supers for each of the Hunter sub-classes: \"Blade Barrage\" for Gunslingers, focusing on throwing a volley of flaming knives; \"Spectral Blades\" for Nightstalkers, allowing players to see through walls and attack with Void daggers; and \"Whirling Guard\" for Arcstriders, which allows players to block projectiles by spinning their Arc Staff.\n*Warlocks continue to have access to the Void-based \"Voidwalker\" sub-class from the original game and the Arc-based \"Stormcaller\" sub-class from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with several changes. The Warlock's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Solar-based \"Dawnblade\" with a super called \"Daybreak\", replacing the \"Sunsinger\" sub-class of the original. The Daybreak super allows the player to make Solar Light blades to strike enemies from mid-air.<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' gives Warlocks three new supers: \"Nova Warp\" for Voidwalkers, allowing players to warp around the battlefield and unleash a Void explosion; \"Chaos Reach\" for Stormcallers, which unleashes a beam of Arc energy which can be turned off at any time to conserve Super energy; and \"Well of Radiance\" for Dawnblades, allowing players to create a healing and empowering aura for players to stand in.\n*Titans continue to have access to the Arc-based \"Striker\" sub-class from the original game and the Solar-based \"Sunbreaker\" from the original's ''The Taken King'' expansion, both with significant gameplay changes. The Titan's new sub-class for ''Destiny 2'' is the Void-based \"Sentinel\", replacing the \"Defender\" sub-class of the original, although the Sentinel sub-class can create the Defender's Ward of Dawn shielding bubble if this option is selected. Sentinel's super, \"Sentinel Shield\", allows the player to summon a shield that can block enemy fire and be used offensively (similar to [[Captain America's shield]]).<ref name=\"EGnewsubclasses\"/> ''Forsaken'' added three new supers for Titans: \"Thundercrash\" for Strikers, allowing players to launch into the air and slam onto the ground; \"Burning Maul\" for Sunbreakers, which players wield a large hammer than can unleash flaming tornadoes; and \"Banner Shield\" for Sentinels, which unleashes a protective barrier that allows other players to shoot through.\n\nUpon reaching the character EXP level cap (level 20 at launch, expanded to 50), character progression shifts to improving their \"Power\" level (formerly \"Light\" level) by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources, including \"[[Dungeon crawl|strikes]]\", [[raid (gaming)|raids]], and in-game events. The three weapon classes and five pieces of armor each have a Power level; a character's Power level is the average of that gear. A higher character level allows for better equipment with higher Power levels to be equipped. A higher Power level improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable Power level at launch was 305 and is expanded to 600. Weapons and armor were reorganized in ''Destiny 2''. In the original game, weapons were divided as Primary, Special, and Heavy weapons. At launch, the weapons were categorized as Kinetic, Energy, and Power weapons. Primary weapons and some Special weapons in the original \u2013 such as hand cannons and sidearms \u2013 are classified as Kinetic and Energy weapons. Those without an elemental damage type go in the Kinetic weapons slot while those with an elemental damage type (Arc, Solar, or Void) go in the Energy weapons slot. Power weapons include the Heavy weapons and the more powerful Special weapons from the first game, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, as well as new weapon types, such as the grenade launcher. As of ''Forsaken'', the weapons system was overhauled, with many Power weapons, such as most shotguns, single-shot grenade launchers, and most sniper rifles, being reorganized into Kinetic and Energy weapons slots. With armor, the name of the stats have been changed. Instead of Strength, Intellect, and Discipline, there are stats for Resilience, Recovery, and Mobility. Also for armor, the helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, and class item slots have remained unchanged, but the artifacts slot has been replaced with one for a player's clan banners.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-09-destiny-2-gameplay-beta-features-4747|title=Destiny 2 gameplay changes, beta, release date and everything else we know so far|date=June 9, 2017|last=Reynolds|first=Matthew|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Player versus environment (PvE) ===\nLike the original game, player versus environment game types make up the majority of the game. Areas to explore include [[Earth]]'s European Dead Zone (which was only represented by PvP maps in the original), [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur planet]] [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]]. The ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion adds [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as an explorable area, while the ''Warmind'' expansion adds [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]]. ''Forsaken'' adds two new explorable areas in the Reef: the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City, the latter being the mysterious sanctuary of the Awoken race and an end-game area that is accessible after completing the campaign of ''Forsaken''. The newest expansion, Shadowkeep, adds the Moon as a playable area. There is also a new social space in the European Dead Zone called \"The Farm\", as the main portion of the Tower of the original was destroyed at the start of ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s campaign. However, a lower, undamaged portion of the Tower becomes the main social space post-campaign. Like the original, there are Patrol missions and public events, but emphasis has been placed more on exploration of the worlds, including towns that players can visit and friendly NPCs who can be found in-game and will give side-quests. New missions were added called \"Adventures\", which allow players to explore the area and go on a treasure hunt-like journey to dungeon-like areas. Some Adventures culminate in what is called a Lost Sector, which are somewhat hidden areas in worlds that lead players to a boss that yields rewards upon its defeat. Lost Sectors can be found and accessed without doing an Adventure. Starting with the ''Curse of Osiris'' expansion, Heroic Adventures were added, which are harder versions of Adventures and they rotate each week. A map has also been added to the game, which shows the locations of the NPCs, Adventures, Heroic Adventures, Region Chests, and Lost Sectors. The maps of these new areas are much larger than those in the original ''Destiny'', with one being described as twice as large as any area of the original. Players no longer have to leave a planet and go to orbit to travel to another location; they can now do so immediately from their current in-game location.<ref name=\"GameSpot05172017\"/><ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Another new activity has been added called Flashpoints, which is a weekly milestone that takes place on one of the eight locations and rotates each week. Players complete public events, loot Lost Sectors and complete Heroic Adventures to earn high level rewards.<ref name=\"D2Flashpoint\">{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-flashpoints-weekly/|title=Destiny 2 Has A New Weekly Activity Called 'Flashpoints'|date=June 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}</ref> Similar to the original game, players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions \u2014 Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy. In ''Destiny 2'', however, the factions now compete against each other in the Faction Rally, which is a periodic event that lasts for one week. Faction points are earned by doing various activities. The faction with the most points at the end of the week earns a high level reward for 1,000 Glimmer (in-game currency). The losing factions can also gain the reward, but must pay 50,000 Glimmer for their faction's item.<ref name=\"FactionRally\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/22/destiny-2-bungie-explains-new-faction-rally-event|title=Destiny 2: Bungie Explains New Faction Rally Event|date=September 22, 2017|last=Gilyadov|first=Alex|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOnce a player has completed the main story and has reached the level cap (currently 50), they unlock access to different types of end-game content. These activities include Nightfall strikes (a weekly featured strike with modifiers and high level rewards; as of the ''Forsaken'' expansion, players can choose one of three featured strikes), a strike playlist with modifiers, a Daily Heroic Story playlist, the \"Leviathan\" and \"Last Wish\" raids, the \"Eater of Worlds\" and \"Spire of Stars\" raid lairs, and the \"Escalation Protocol\" and \"Blind Well\" horde activities on Mars and the Dreaming City, respectively, among other PvP activities. A harder difficulty mode called \"Prestige\" is available for the Leviathan raid its raid lairs, with modifiers; there are no plans for a Prestige mode for Last Wish. These end-game activities reward players with powerful gear upon successful completion to increase their Power level.<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/8/16274074/destiny-2-dlc-curse-of-osiris-expansion-leak-mercury</ref>\nIn Destiny 2 Forsaken, they added new special abilities like Daybreak and other abilities.\n\n=== Player versus player (PvP) ===\nLike the original, player versus player combat exists in what is called the Crucible with Lord Shaxx returning as its NPC. The original ''Destiny''{{'}}s Crucible featured six-versus-six and three-versus-three game modes, as well as a limited time two-versus-two mode. At launch, all game modes were four-versus-four as Bungie shifted their focus to smaller teams for competitive multiplayer and better map design, but Quickplay modes eventually became six-versus-six. Like the original, player statistics such as weapon power and defense are balanced between players in Crucible game modes. The in-game [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] was updated so that players can see if an enemy has their super charged or has power ammo. Currently, players have the option to choose between four rotating playlists, rumble (a six player 1v1v1v1v1v1 gamemode) survival and freelance survival (A version of survival where players cannot choose the teammates on their team), classic mix, and private matches.\n\nTrials of Osiris from the original game was replaced by Trials of the Nine. Like Trials of Osiris, Trials of the Nine begins on Fridays and ends with the weekly reset on Tuesdays. The game mode for this new Trials, however, has changed; instead of using the Elimination mode of the original, Trials of the Nine rotates each week between ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s two new game modes, Countdown and Survival. Only one map is featured for Trials' four-day duration, but the map also rotates weekly. Player's gear is locked during Trials, meaning they cannot change it for the duration of a match. Unlike Trials of Osiris, players can gain access to the Trials of the Nine's social space called The Spire, located in unknown space, for completing a match of Trials and earning Trials tokens. There, players will meet an NPC called the Emissary of the Nine, who will exchange tokens for gear. Gaining three, five, and seven wins on the score card, respectively, gains access to the upper tiers of the social space with greater rewards at each tier. Going flawless with seven wins allows admittance into an exclusive area with even greater rewards. Three losses resets the score card. To access Trials of the Nine, players must have completed the campaign, completed Lord Shaxx's \"Call to Arms\" milestone, and have a Power level of at least 260.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-trials-of-the-nine-mode-date/|title=Destiny 2 Details Trials of the Nine Debut [UPDATED]|date=September 8, 2017|last=Albert|first=Weston|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-what-is-trials-of-the-nine-how-to-get-st/1100-6453377/|title=Destiny 2: What Is Trials Of The Nine? How To Get Started|date=September 15, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref> Trials of the nine has been put on permanent hiatus, but a new trials game mode has been speculated heavily. Recently on 2/26/20 Bungie released the reveal trailer for the next season (season of the worthy) as well as revealing that trials of osiris will be returning as a part of this dlc. It has been confirmed that Trials of Osiris will be released on 3/13/20. However, instead of the usual 9 wins without losing to go flawless, the new gamemode will only require 7 wins.\n\nThe periodic competitive Iron Banner PvP mode of the original game, which disabled balancing of player's gear, also returned for the sequel. ''Destiny 2''{{'}}s Iron Banner, however, does not disable balancing, with Bungie stating that \"Your fighting abilities, not your power levels, will decide the outcome\". This was changed following the release of ''Forsaken'', with balancing becoming disabled like the original game. Like the original, Iron Banner lasts for one week and features milestones to complete daily. Players must have completed the campaign and be level 20 to access Iron Banner, which features the returning Lord Saladin from the original game as its NPC.<ref name=\"D2IronBanner\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-iron-banner-gear-rewards-when-it-starts-/1100-6453830/|title=Destiny 2: Iron Banner Gear Rewards, When It Starts, What's New, And How To Access It|date=October 7, 2017|last1=Pereira|first1=Chris|last2=Makuch|first2=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA new PvP mode that was added in the ''Forsaken'' expansion is called Gambit, a best-of-three rounds mode that combines both PvE and PvP, featuring the Drifter as its NPC. A 24-hour free trial of the mode was made available to all players on September 1, 2018, three days prior to the launch of ''Forsaken''. Two teams of four players compete against each other by defeating PvE enemies. Enemies, when defeated, drop motes which players can pick up and deposit in a bank in the center of the arena. Depositing 5, 10 or 15 motes send small, medium or large enemy blockers, respectively, to the opposing team's arena and locks their bank; the opposing team must defeat the blockers in order to reactivate their bank. Every 25 motes deposited opens a portal where one team member can invade the other team's arena. Defeating members of the opposing team drops any motes that they are carrying. After depositing a certain amount of motes, a boss will spawn in the middle of the arena; if a team member is defeated by an invading member of the opposing team, the boss regains health. The first team that defeats their boss wins the round.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see|Destiny (video game)#Setting}}\nOne year after the [[Destiny: Rise of Iron#Plot|SIVA Crisis]], Cabal forces of the Red Legion launch an aerial assault on the Last City, destroying the main portion of the Tower, the headquarters of the Guardians. The player's Guardian and their Ghost respond by assisting the Vanguard in assaulting the Red Legion command ship. As they confront the Red Legion's commander, Dominus Ghaul, his forces attach a device to the Traveler and begin draining it of the Light, the power used by the Guardians. The Guardian loses their powers and is nearly killed by Ghaul. Waking two days after the attack, the Guardian locates their Ghost. They find a haven known as \"the Farm\" in the European Dead Zone (EDZ) with the assistance of Suraya Hawthorne, a non-Guardian human from the outskirts of the Last City.\n\nThe Guardian follows a vision to encounter a shard of the Traveler hidden in a forest within the EDZ. Ghost interfaces with the shard and both its and the Guardian's Light are restored. After restoring long range communications, Hawthorne intercepts a distress call from Commander Zavala, urging surviving Guardians to travel to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and assist in mounting a counter-offensive. Against Hawthorne's objections, the Guardian travels to Titan, which has been overrun by the Hive. With assistance from Deputy Commander Sloane, they learn that the Red Legion was dispatched to the [[Milky Way]] in response to a distress call sent during the [[Destiny: The Taken King#Plot|Taken War]] two years prior, and that Ghaul possesses a superweapon known as the Almighty, a space station capable of destroying stars. Resistance to Cabal rule has resulted in entire star systems being destroyed. The intelligence also reveals that the Almighty is positioned near the Sun, breaking up the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as fuel. Zavala tasks the Guardian to find Ikora Rey and Cayde-6 to assist in a counterattack to retake the Last City. During this time, it is shown that Ghaul, aided by his mentor, the Consul, overthrew Emperor Calus and took control of the Cabal, and has been studying the Traveler in order to learn how to use the Light and legitimize himself as Emperor.\n\nThe Guardian locates Cayde-6 on the centaur planet [[7066 Nessus|Nessus]], which has almost been completely transformed by the Vex. With the aid of Failsafe, an AI from the crashed starship ''Exodus Black'', the Guardian frees Cayde from a Vex portal loop, and claims a teleporter for use in taking back the City. Cayde directs the Guardian to find Ikora on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] moon of [[Io (moon)|Io]], where she had gone to find answers about the Traveler. Ikora and Io researcher Asher Mir directs the Guardian to locate a Warmind, an ancient defensive AI for intelligence on the Almighty. Afterwards, the Vanguard reunites at the Farm and conclude that the only way to retake the Last City and save the Traveler is to shut down the Almighty first, eliminating the possibility of it destroying the Sun. The Guardian boards the Almighty and destroys the weapon, signaling Zavala to begin the counterattack. As the Vanguard begins the assault, the Consul admonishes Ghaul for his obsession with the Traveler, and urges him to take the Light; Ghaul is reluctant until the Consul kills the Speaker, whom Ghaul had captured and tortured to try and learn more about the Traveler. Ghaul then proclaims that he will take the Light, and strangles the Consul in a fit of rage.\n\nThe Guardian returns to Earth to assist in the counterattack and infiltrates Ghaul's command ship alone to save the Traveler. Ghaul forcibly takes the Light, corrupting it, and uses its power against the Guardian, but the Guardian is successful in defeating Ghaul. Ghaul reemerges as a massive ethereal figure who then speaks to the Traveler directly. In doing so, the Traveler wakes from its long sleep, destroying the device that was harvesting its power and killing Ghaul. It sends a massive shockwave, restoring the Light and decimating the Red Legion's forces. The game ends with a posthumous voiceover from the Speaker, reminding all that the Light can never be stopped. The Guardian and Ghost convene with Zavala, Ikora, Cayde, and Hawthorne at an undamaged portion of the Tower, with the Vanguard returning to their old duties and Hawthorne assuming a new post there. In a post-credits scene, the shockwave sent by the Traveler is shown reaching the entire system. The wave of Light extends beyond the Solar System and spreads beyond the Milky Way, before panning across a fleet of dark, unknown ships sitting some distance away in extragalactic space.\n\nFollowing Ghaul's defeat, a massive Cabal ship called the Leviathan appears in orbit of Nessus, under the control of the exiled Emperor Calus. Calus invites Guardians to complete a series of challenges before reaching his throne (\"Leviathan\" raid). A fireteam of Guardians complete his challenges before facing Calus himself; however, after overcoming his strange powers and defeating him, they discover that they were fighting a mechanical doppelganger. The real Calus speaks through the machine, claiming that what they know is a lie and that there is a truth beyond what the Speaker had told them.\n\n== Development ==\nA sequel to ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' was first mentioned in November 2014, two months after the original released, by [[Activision]] [[chief executive officer]] Eric Hirshberg, where he said \"Work has also begun on future expansion packs as well as on our next full game release\".<ref>{{cite web| last = Thier| first = Dave | title = 'Destiny' Sequel Already In The Works| work = [[Forbes]]| date = November 4, 2014| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2014/11/04/destiny-sequel-already-in-the-works/| accessdate = January 25, 2015}}</ref> Based on documents of the original release schedule for ''Destiny'', Bungie and Activision intended to release new, disc-based sequels every other year until 2019, with large downloadable expansions in between.<ref name=\"originalreleaseschedule\"/> Originally planned for a September 2016 release (based on the original documents),<ref name=\"originalreleaseschedule\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-not-launching-september-2016-report-says/1100-6434074/|title=Destiny 2 Not Launching September 2016, Report Says|date=January 22, 2016|last=Hussain|first=Tamoor|magazine=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}</ref> Bungie confirmed on February 11, 2016 that a full sequel would release in 2017.<ref name=\"glimpse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bungie.net/en/News/News?aid=44353|title=This Week At Bungie \u2013 02/11/2016|date=February 11, 2016|author=DeeJ|publisher=[[Bungie]]|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"IGNY2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/11/destiny-2-in-2017-large-new-expansion-coming-2016|title=Destiny 2 in 2017, 'Large New Expansion' Coming to Destiny 2016|date=February 11, 2016|last=Dyer|first=Mitch|website=IGN|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref> That same month, video game writer Christopher Schlerf, who was the lead writer for ''[[Halo 4]]'' and worked on ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', joined Bungie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/destinys-new-writer-proves-bungie-finally-taking-its-story-seriously/ |title=Destiny's new writer proves Bungie is finally taking its story seriously|date=February 16, 2016|last=Skrebels|first=Joe|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, Bungie announced that [[Vicarious Visions]] would be joining the development team along with Activision.<ref>{{cite web| last = McWertor| first =Michael| title = Destiny development team expands with Vicarious Visions| work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]| publisher = [[Vox Media]]| date = December 8, 2016| url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/8/13888632/destiny-development-team-vicarious-visions | accessdate = December 11, 2016}}</ref> Unlike the original, it was rumored that ''Destiny 2'' would also release on [[Microsoft Windows]],<ref name=\"Destiny22017\"/> which was confirmed on March 30, 2017.<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/30/15125010/destiny-2-trailer-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc|title=Destiny 2 launching Sept. 8, watch the reveal trailer|date=March 30, 2017|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Activision's earnings report for 2016, Hirshberg said that ''Destiny''{{'}}s sequel was still \"on track for release this fall [2017].\" Activision said the sequel would \"broaden the franchise's global reach.\" Hirshberg elaborated that players who had spent hours in the original would \"love\" the sequel, and for those who had not played ''Destiny'', or had not played in a while, {{quote|... we think we've made a sequel that's going to have a lot for them to love, too.

Bungie's aim was to have the game able to be played by anyone with their friends, regardless of platform, so they implemented cross-saving, allowing players to transfer their characters from one platform to another. Alongside this, they partnered with [[Google]] to offer ''Destiny 2'' on [[Google Stadia|Stadia]], a new game streaming service.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/6/18655373/destiny-2-google-stadia-cross-save-transfer-xbox-one-pc | title=  Destiny 2 coming to Google Stadia with character transfers from other platforms  | first=  Michael | last= McWhertor | date = June 6, 2019 | accessdate = June 6, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Additionally, alongside the release of ''Shadowkeep'', Bungie made ''Destiny 2'' [[free to play]] in its \"New Light\" version, making the base game, the Leviathan raid, and many of the player-versus-player modes free, including the first two expansions, ''Curse of Osiris'' and ''Warmind''. Content like ''Forsaken'' and ''Shadowkeep'' can be purchased \u00e0 la carte by the player.

Bungie stated that their plan was to provide post-release content at a quicker rate than that of the original ''Destiny'', which was criticized for not having enough content post-launch and between each of its expansions releases. One of the team's remedies for this were the Adventures and Lost Sectors activities that were added to the free roam Patrol mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-post-launch-plans/|title=Destiny 2 Devs Talk Post-Release Content Plans|date=June 2017|last=Henry|first=Jasmine|work=Game Rant|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Bungie also announced the ''Destiny 2'' Expansion Pass prior to launch, which grants access to the first two expansions of the game.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> The in-game clan features became available a few days after the game's launch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-clan-features-wont-work-in-game-for-sev/1100-6453128/|title=Destiny 2's Clan Features Won't Work In-Game For \"Several Days\" After Launch|date=September 7, 2017|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> The Guided Games feature became available on September 12 for the Nightfall activity, the game's first raid, \"Leviathan\", unlocked on September 13 (with the Guided Games in beta), and Trials of the Nine became available on September 15, along with the character X\u00fbr from the original game, the exotic items vendor who only appears on the weekends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-release-date-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-raid-an/1100-6453052/|title=Destiny 2 Release Date On PS4 And Xbox One, Raid And Nightfall Debuts Confirmed|date=September 6, 2017|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref> The three factions and their respective NPCs from the original game returned on September 26 for a new periodic event, Faction Rally.<ref name=\"FactionRally\"/> The competitive Iron Banner PvP mode from the original returned on October 10.<ref name=\"D2IronBanner\"/> The prestige mode for the Leviathan raid was originally scheduled to unlock on October 10, but was delayed to October 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-prestige-raid-for-leviathan-unlocks-nex/1100-6453827/|title=Destiny 2's Prestige Raid For Leviathan Unlocks Next Week|date=October 7, 2017|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe game's first expansion released on December 5, 2017. Named ''[[Destiny 2: Curse of Osiris|Curse of Osiris]]'', it focuses on the character Osiris from the lore of the original ''Destiny''. The expansion takes players to the planet Mercury with its own patrol mode. Additionally, the EXP level cap was raised to 25 and the Power level cap was raised to 330. There was also a timed-exclusive Crucible map for PS4 players called Wormhaven. Instead of an entirely new raid, a feature called raid lair was added, featuring new areas to the existing Leviathan raid and a different final boss.<ref name=\"ExpansionI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-curse-of-osiris-dlc-increases-the-level-/1100-6454529/|title=Destiny 2 Curse Of Osiris DLC Increases The Level Cap|date=October 31, 2017|last=Pereira|first=Chris|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> The second expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Warmind|Warmind]]'', was released on May 8, 2018 and focuses on the Warmind Rasputin from the original game. This expansion takes players to the planet Mars in a new area called [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas Basin]]. The expansion also features a new mode called \"Escalation Protocol\", a horde mode which can be started by any player in the patrol mode on Mars. As well, the EXP level cap was raised to 30 and the Power level cap was raised to 380. In addition to Rasputin, a new character named Ana Bray (also from the lore of the original ''Destiny'') was added, who serves as the primary NPC on Mars. Like the previous expansion, ''Warmind'' also includes a second raid lair on the Leviathan. The expansion also added progressive ranking systems for PvP, titled Valor and Glory. Players earn Valor in quickplay matches while Glory is earned in competitive matches, with each new rank earning greater rewards. Valor points are earned regardless of win or loss, while Glory points are earned by wins but reduced by losses.<ref name=\"Eurogamer06092017\"/> Both expansions featured timed-exclusive content for the PlayStation 4 platform, which became available for other platforms in late 2019.\n\nThe game saw many seasonal events during its first year of service, which were free to all players regardless of which version of the game they owned. \"The Dawning\" holiday event from the original ''Destiny'' returned on December 19, 2017 and ended on January 9, 2018. Both social spaces were redecorated for the event along with snow weather. Players could create snowballs in the social spaces and during strikes and throw these at other players or enemies (which damaged enemies). The Crucible game mode \"Mayhem\" (all abilities restore rapidly) was also brought back from the original ''Destiny''. New Milestones with event-themed rewards were also added.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-holiday-event-is-now-playable-on-ps4-xb/1100-6455748/|title=Destiny 2's Holiday Event Is Now Playable On PS4, Xbox One, And PC|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=December 19, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> \"Crimson Days\", the [[Valentine's Day]]-themed event from Year 2 (2016) of the original ''Destiny'', returned for ''Destiny 2'' on February 13, 2018, and like the original, it ran for only one week. Just as in the original event, Crimson Days featured a 2-versus-2 Crucible mode\u2013the only in ''Destiny 2''\u2013however, the mode was modified from the original. Staying close to a teammate caused all abilities to recharge quicker, while being apart gave away both players' locations to the opposing team. Players could earn Crimson Engrams, granting new rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crimson-days-launches-with-new-update-on/1100-6456750/|title=Destiny 2 Crimson Days Launches With New Update On PC, PS4, And Xbox One|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=February 13, 2018|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=February 13, 2018}}</ref> Crimson Days was later rebranded into a separate but permanent mode called \"Doubles\" as a rotating mode in the Crucible. A brand new summer event called \"Solstice of Heroes\" began on July 31, 2018 and ended on August 28, 2018, to commemorate the first year of the game. The Power level cap was raised to 400 for the event. A new NPC called the Statue of Heroes was added and provided bounties that, when turned in, awarded Moments of Triumph points for players which could be used to earn exclusive rewards. Players received \"Scorched\" armor pieces at Power level 240 at the start of the event, which could then be upgraded to \"Rekindled\" armor at Power level 340, then to \"Resplendent\" armor at Power level 400, all by completing specific requirements for each armor piece, including playing through 5 revamped (Redux) missions from the original ''Destiny 2'' campaign. Players could also earn Solstice Engrams, which also granted new rewards.\n\nThe third expansion, ''[[Destiny 2: Forsaken|Forsaken]]'', was released on September 4, 2018, beginning Year 2 of ''Destiny 2''. Similar to the original [[Destiny: The Taken King|''Destiny''{{'}}s ''The Taken King'']] expansion, ''Forsaken'' had a large overhaul on gameplay, though not to the extent that ''The Taken King'' had with the original ''Destiny''. A large expansion, the story has a \"western revenge\" theme, according to Bungie. A large portion of the expansion takes place in the Reef's Tangled Shore, including a new raid called \"Last Wish\", which takes place in the end-game area, the Dreaming City, also located in the Reef. The developers claimed that it has more bosses than any previous raid (including from the original game) with a massive roam area, puzzles, and the raid changes over time based on players' actions in the raid itself. There is also a new mode called Gambit that combines PvE and PvP, and features its own ranking system called Infamy, which works similar to the Crucible's Valor ranking system. Two teams of four players compete against each other while facing PvE enemies. A new weapon type, a bow and arrow, was also added. The EXP level cap was raised to 50 and the Power level cap was raised to 600.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-release-date-new-mode-trail/1100-6459402/|title=Destiny 2 Forsaken DLC Release Date, New Mode, Trailer, And More Details|date=June 6, 2018|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> A trailer displayed during Sony's E3 2018 press conference showed the death of Cayde-6 by the hands of the returning Prince Uldren Sov.

The expansion sees players return to the [[Moon]], an area that was featured in the first ''Destiny'' game. The location was reprised and expanded upon with Bungie claiming it to be twice the size of the original location from ''Destiny''.<ref name=\"Gilliam\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/17/18679445/destiny-2-shadowkeep-moon-black-garden-artifact-gate-lord-armor-2-0-pvp-crota-exotic-finishing-move|title=Everything we know is coming to Destiny 2: Shadowkeep|last=Gilliam|first=Ryan|date=2019-06-17|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> The story of ''Shadowkeep'' sees the return of Eris Morn, a character from the first game who has been absent since the events of ''Destiny 2''. Eris seeks the help of the player character in defeating \"Nightmares\" that she released into the solar system, which are manifestations of the Guardians' past. Guardians face off against their previous adversaries, which are being resurrected by the Darkness.

Although he said the variety of weapons were fun, the Kinetic weapons \"didn't seem to pack as much of a punch as their Energy [weapon] counterparts.\"<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Cody Perez of ''[[Game Revolution]]'', however, welcomed the recategorized weapons, saying they were less restrictive and said that \"Bungie are masters of gun-play\".<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Kallie Plagge of [[GameSpot]] said that the game features mostly the same structure as the original, including its \"mechanically excellent shooting and satisfying loot grind\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/> Carter praised the Lost Sectors and public events, as well as the additional story quests and Adventures post-campaign.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Miller said that the Lost Sectors were fun, but they became less interesting with the more that were done.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez, however, was not a fan of the Adventures and Lost Sectors activities, saying they were a \"disconnect [from] the main campaign\". He said that they were filler content, and that they were \"monotonous and a bore to accomplish, lacking the heart that fills the campaign.\" He did praise the public events as they are only periodic.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/>\n\nThe Leviathan raid received praise and criticism. Miller of ''Game Informer'' stated that the Leviathan raid was \"one of Bungie's most intricate and fascinating environments to date\", praising its maze-like structure with hidden chests and secret passages. He was critical of the award system, however, stating that it \"separates the excitement of new gear from the moment of victory\", as it does not offer most loot until a full completion.<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Slead of ''EGM'' said that \"the bread and butter of ''Destiny'' is still these post-campaign quests\", also referring to Strikes and the weekly Nightfall activity.<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'', who did not play any of the original game's raids, was a big fan of the Leviathan raid, stating that it exceeded its hype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/348153-destiny-2-leviathan-raid-review-exceeds-hype|title=Destiny 2's Leviathan Raid Exceeds the Hype|date=September 13, 2017|last=Perez|first=Cody|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> Plagge of GameSpot said that \"solving [the raid's] often obscure puzzles can be both rewarding and frustrating\", but \"each failure teaches you something new\".<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nThe original ''Destiny'' was largely criticized for its story. ''Destiny 2'', however, was praised for its improvements to the story and easier access to the universe's lore. Slead of ''EGM'' said that it has a \"more robust story\" and Bungie fixed the \"meandering storytelling from the first\".<ref name=\"EGMReview\"/> Carter of ''Destructoid'' said that although its story was similar to others in the same genre, \"it's easy to follow and even easier to get invested in, with the game's cast coming front and center.\"<ref name=\"DestructoidReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' said that the story \"[gripped] me in a way that only Bungie's former series ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' was able to.\" He said that there were many moments that were of shock and awe, and that the game had a meaningful narrative with an actual fleshed out villain.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> Plagge of GameSpot said that the story serves its main purpose and that its strength \"lie in atmosphere and side details\", while also praising its \"mournful soundtrack\" as fantastic.<ref name=\"GSpotReview\"/>\n\nMiller of ''Game Informer'' praised the Crucible mode for feeling more competitive than the original ''Destiny''{{'}}s, with teamwork being \"highly valued\". However, Miller was \"perplexed by the decision to force players into one of two playlists\", instead of letting them choose. He was also indifferent to the change of making all modes four-versus-four, but said that \"the compact group size demands everyone pull their weight, which is great.\"<ref name=\"GIReview\"/> Perez of ''Game Revolution'' was disappointed that Crucible did not receive \"the same love that the singleplayer had been given.\" He said that although the smaller map sizes were not a bad thing, it causes multiplayer to be non-stop action, not allowing players to take a moment to strategize.<ref name=\"GameRevReview\"/> David Houghton of ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' said that the changes to the Crucible

Although they attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including [[cat]]s and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.\n\nDepending on the species and local conditions, pocket gophers may have a specific annual breeding season, or may breed repeatedly through the year.

The stashing and subsequent decomposition of plant material in the gophers' larder can produce deep fertilization of the soil.\n\nPocket gophers are [[wikt:solitary|solitary]] outside of the [[Seasonal breeder|breeding season]], aggressively maintaining [[Territory (animal)|territories]] that vary in size depending on the resources available. Males and females may share some burrows and nesting chambers if their territories border each other, but in general, each pocket gopher inhabits its own individual tunnel system. Although they attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including [[cat]]s and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.\n\nDepending on the species and local conditions, pocket gophers may have a specific annual breeding season, or may breed repeatedly through the year. Each litter typically consists of two to five young, although this may be much higher in some species. The young are born blind and helpless, and are [[weaning|weaned]] around 40 days old.<ref name=\"EoM\">{{cite book|editor= Macdonald, D.|author= Patton, James|year= 1984|title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location= New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/628 628\u2013631]|isbn= 0-87196-871-1|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/628}}</ref>\n\n==Control==\n''Geomys'' and ''Thomomys'' species are classed as \"prohibited new organisms\" under New Zealand's [[Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996]], preventing them from being imported into the country.<ref>{{citation| url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|title=Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 2003 - Schedule 2 Prohibited new organisms|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nMuch debate exists among [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] about which races of pocket gophers should be recognized as full species, and the following list cannot be regarded as definitive.\n* Family '''Geomyidae'''\n** Genus ''[[Cratogeomys]]'';

Though Cochran lost the case, it became a turning point in his career. Rather than seeing the case as a defeat, Cochran realized the trial itself had awakened the black community. In reference to the loss, Cochran wrote in ''The American Lawyer,'' \"those were extremely difficult cases to win in those days.

Each phrase is assigned a slant index based on how often it is used by Democrat vs Republican members of U.S. Congress and this lean rating is assigned to a Wikipedia contribution that includes the same key phrase. The authors concluded that older articles from the early years of Wikipedia leaned Democratic, whereas those created more recently held more balance. They suggest that articles did not change their bias significantly due to revision, but rather that over time newer articles containing opposite points of view were responsible for centering the average overall.<ref name=\"GZ2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Greenstein|first1=Shane|last2=Zhu|first2=Feng|authorlink1=Shane Greenstein|title=Is Wikipedia Biased?|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=May 2012|volume=102|issue=3|pages=343\u2013348|doi=10.1257/aer.102.3.343|publisher=[[American Economic Association]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Study: Wikipedia perpetuates political bias|author=Khimm, Suzy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/study-wikipedia-perpetuates-political-bias/2012/06/18/gJQAaA3llV_blog.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 18, 2012|accessdate=May 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523011521/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/study-wikipedia-perpetuates-political-bias/2012/06/18/gJQAaA3llV_blog.html|archive-date=May 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Wisdom\">{{cite journal|arxiv=1712.06414|doi=10.1038/s41562-019-0541-6|pmid=30971793|title=The wisdom of polarized crowds|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=3|issue=4|pages=329\u2013336|year=2019|last1=Shi|first1=Feng|last2=Teplitskiy|first2=Misha|last3=Duede|first3=Eamon|last4=Evans|first4=James A.}}</ref>{{rp|4-5}}\n\nIn a more extensive American follow-up study, ''Do Experts or Collective Intelligence Write with More Bias?

The authors found that \"Wikipedia articles are more slanted towards Democratic views than are Britannica articles, as well as more biased\", particularly those focusing on civil rights, corporations, and government. Entries about immigration trended toward Republican. They further found that \"(t)he difference in bias between a pair of articles decreases with more revisions\" and, when articles were substantially revised, the difference in bias compared to ''Britannica'' was statistically negligible.

Each phrase is assigned a slant index based on how often it is used by Democrat vs Republican members of U.S. Congress and this lean rating is assigned to a Wikipedia contribution that includes the same key phrase. The authors concluded that older articles from the early years of Wikipedia leaned Democratic, whereas those created more recently held more balance. They suggest that articles did not change their bias significantly due to revision, but rather that over time newer articles containing opposite points of view were responsible for centering the average overall.<ref name=\"GZ2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Greenstein|first1=Shane|last2=Zhu|first2=Feng|authorlink1=Shane Greenstein|title=Is Wikipedia Biased?|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=May 2012|volume=102|issue=3|pages=343\u2013348|doi=10.1257/aer.102.3.343|publisher=[[American Economic Association]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Study: Wikipedia perpetuates political bias|author=Khimm, Suzy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/study-wikipedia-perpetuates-political-bias/2012/06/18/gJQAaA3llV_blog.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 18, 2012|accessdate=May 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523011521/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/study-wikipedia-perpetuates-political-bias/2012/06/18/gJQAaA3llV_blog.html|archive-date=May 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Wisdom\">{{cite journal|arxiv=1712.06414|doi=10.1038/s41562-019-0541-6|pmid=30971793|title=The wisdom of polarized crowds|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=3|issue=4|pages=329\u2013336|year=2019|last1=Shi|first1=Feng|last2=Teplitskiy|first2=Misha|last3=Duede|first3=Eamon|last4=Evans|first4=James A.}}</ref>{{rp|4-5}}\n\nIn a more extensive American follow-up study, ''Do Experts or Collective Intelligence Write with More Bias?

Entries about immigration trended toward Republican.

Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoehohphopho starling]] sfrom nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observeds it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 2079, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings.

Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of [[\u00cele Gombrani]], which was then called au M\u00e2t. [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]], a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Hume\n| first1 = J.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings.

Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower.

The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

One study finds that, \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses.\"<ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|title = Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal = Demography|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 0070-3370|pages = 739\u2013763|volume = 46|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/dem.0.0076|pmid = 20084827|first = Carolyn|last = Moehling|first2 = Anne Morrison|last2 = Piehl|pmc = 2831353}}</ref>\n\nFor the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had \"quite similar\" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for major crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930.<ref name=\":28\" /> Contemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable ways.<ref name=\":28\" /> A study by Harvard economist [[Nathan Nunn]], Yale economist [[Nancy Qian]] and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131920) had no long-run effects on crime rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Sandra|last2=Nunn|first2=Nathan|last3=Qian|first3=Nancy|date=March 2017 |title=Migrants and the Making of America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Immigration during the Age of Mass Migration |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23289 |doi=10.3386/w23289 }}</ref>\n\n==== Terrorism ====\nAccording to a review by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fact-checker of the available research and evidence, there is nothing to support President Trump's claim that \"the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.\"<ref name=\":48\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/15/president-trumps-claim-that-foreigners-comprise-the-vast-majority-of-terrorism-convictions-since-911/|title=Analysis {{!}} President Trump's claim that foreigners are responsible for 'the vast majority' of terrorism convictions since 9/11|last=|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> The fact-checker noted that the Government Accountability Office had found that \"of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since Sept. 12, 2001, 73 percent (62) were committed by far-right-wing violent extremist groups, and 27 percent (23) by radical Islamist violent extremists\".<ref name=\":48\" /> A bulletin by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security also warned in May 2017 that white supremacist groups were \u201cresponsible for a lion\u2019s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups\".<ref name=\":48\" /> According to a report by the [[New America (organization)|New America]] foundation, of the individuals credibly involved in radical Islamist-inspired activity in the United States since 9/11, the large majority were US-born citizens, not immigrants.<ref name=\":48\" />\n\nA 2018 paper found no statistically significant evidence that refugee settlements in the United States are linked to terrorism events.<ref name=\":54\" />\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\n{{Further|Immigration to Australia|Crime in Australia}}\n\nA 2019 study found no impact of immigration on crime rates in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sydes|first=Michelle|date=2019-09-18|title=Immigration, Ethnicity, and Neighborhood Violence: Considering Both Concentration and Diversity Effects|journal=Race and Justice|language=en-US|pages=215336871987518|doi=10.1177/2153368719875183|issn=2153-3687}}</ref> Foreigners are under-represented in the Australian prison population, according to 2010 figures.<ref name=\":34\" /> A 1987 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that studies had consistently found that migrant populations in Australia had lower crime rates than the Australian-born population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/archive/migration-ethnicity-and-crime-in-australian-society|title=Migration, ethnicity and crime in Australian society|last=Hazlehurst|first=Kayleen|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe alleged link between immigration and criminality has been a longstanding meme in Australian history with many of the original immigrants being convicts. During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.<ref name=\"Taycc\">{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|work=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref> A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

One study finds that, \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

The Socialist Party replaced the earlier [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) in 1969, and is currently led by First Secretary [[Olivier Faure]]. The PS is a member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES), the [[Socialist International]] (SI) and the [[Progressive Alliance]].\n\nThe PS first won power in 1981, when its candidate [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected [[President of France]] in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. Under Mitterrand, the party achieved a governing majority in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1993.

Its leaders were killed or exiled. France's first socialist party, the [[Federation of the Socialist Workers of France]], was founded in 1879. It was characterised as \"possibilist\" because it promoted [[Reformism|gradual reforms]]. Two parties split off from it: in 1882, the [[French Workers' Party]] of [[Jules Guesde]] and [[Paul Lafargue]] (the son-in-law of [[Karl Marx]]), then in 1890 the [[Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (France)|Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party]] of [[Jean Allemane]]. At the same time, the heirs of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], a symbol of the French revolutionary tradition, created the [[Central Revolutionary Committee]] led by [[\u00c9douard Vaillant]]. There were also some declared socialist deputies such as [[Alexandre Millerand]] and [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] who did not belong to any party.\n\nIn 1899, the participation of Millerand in [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau]]'s cabinet caused a debate about socialist participation in a \"bourgeois government\". Three years later, Jaur\u00e8s, Allemane and the possibilists founded the possibilist [[French Socialist Party (1902)|French Socialist Party]], which supported participation in government, while Guesde and Vaillant formed the [[Socialist Party of France (1902)|Socialist Party of France]], which opposed such co-operation. In 1905, during the [[Globe Congress]], the two groups merged in the [[French Section of the Workers International]] (SFIO). Leader of the parliamentary group and director of the party paper ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', Jaur\u00e8s was its most influential figure.\n\nThe party was hemmed in between the [[Liberal elite|middle-class liberals]] of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] and the revolutionary [[syndicalism|syndicalists]] who dominated the trade unions. Furthermore, the goal to rally all the Socialists in one single party was partially reached: some elects refused to join the SFIO and created the [[Republican-Socialist Party]], which supported socialist participation in liberal governments. Together with the Radicals, who wished to install [[La\u00efcit\u00e9|laicism]], the SFIO was a component of the Left Block (''[[Bloc des gauches]]'') without to sit in the government. In 1906, the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] trade union claimed its independence from all political parties.\n\nThe French socialists were strongly anti-war, but following the assassination of Jaur\u00e8s in 1914 they were unable to resist the wave of militarism which followed the outbreak of World War I. They suffered a severe split over participation in the wartime government of national unity. In 1919 the anti-war socialists were heavily defeated in elections. In 1920, during the [[Tours Congress]], the majority and left wing of the party broke away and formed the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] to join the [[Comintern|Third International]] founded by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The right wing, led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], kept the \"old house\" and remained in the SFIO.\n\nIn 1924 and in 1932, the Socialists joined with the Radicals in the Coalition of the Left (''[[Cartel des Gauches]]''), but refused to join the non-Socialist governments led by the Radicals [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier]]. These governments failed because the Socialists and the Radicals could not agree on economic policy, and also because the Communists, following the [[Third Period|policy]] laid down by the Soviet Union, refused to support governments presiding over capitalist economies. The question of the possibility of a government participation with Radicals caused the split of \"neosocialists\" at the beginning of the 1930s. They merged with the [[Republican-Socialist Party]] in the [[Socialist Republican Union]].\n\nIn 1934, the Communists changed their line, and the four left-wing parties came together in the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], which won the 1936 elections and brought Blum to power as France's first SFIO Prime Minister. Indeed, for the first time in its history, the SFIO obtained more votes and seats than the Radical Party and it formed the central axis of a left-wing parliamentary majority. Within a year, however, his government collapsed over economic policy and also over the issue of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The fall of the Popular Front caused a new split from the SFIO, with the departure of the left wing of the party, led by [[Marceau Pivert]], to the [[Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party]]. The demoralised Left fell apart and was unable to resist the collapse of the [[French Third Republic]] after the military defeat of 1940.\n\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, the SFIO re-emerged in a coalition with a powerful [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), which became the largest left-wing party, and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP). This alliance installed the main elements of the French [[welfare state]] and the [[French Fourth Republic]], but it did not survive the Cold War. In May 1947, the Socialist Prime Minister [[Paul Ramadier]] dismissed the Communist ministers. Blum proposed the construction of a [[Third Force (France)|Third Force]] with the centre-left and the centre-right, against the Gaullists and the Communists. However, his candidate to lead of the SFIO, [[Daniel Mayer]], was defeated by [[Guy Mollet]].\n\nMollet was supported by the left wing of the party. Paradoxically, he spoke a [[Marxism|Marxist]] language without questioning the alliance with the centre and the centre-right. His leadership was shaken when the party divided in 1954 about the [[European Defence Community]] (the half of the SFIO parliamentary group voted \"no\", against the instructions of the party lead, participating to the failure of the project). But later, Mollet got involved the SFIO in the build of a centre-left coalition, the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], which won a plurality in the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 elections]]. Consequently, he was Prime Minister at the head of a minority government. But the party was in decline, as were the Radicals, and the left never came close to forming a united front. Indeed, this led Mollet to assert, \"the Communist Party is not on the left, but in the East\". The repressive policy of Mollet in the [[Algerian War]] and his support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s come-back in 1958 (the party lead called to vote \"yes\" in referendum on [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]'s constitution) caused a split and the foundation of the dissident [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU). The SFIO returned to opposition in 1959. Discredited by its fluctuating policy during the Fourth Republic, it reached its lowest ebb in the 1960s.\n\nBoth because of its opposition to the principle of presidential election by [[universal suffrage]] and because De Gaulle's re-election appeared inevitable, the SFIO did not nominate a candidate for the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]]. Consequently, it supported the candidacy of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], a former minister of the Fourth Republic who had been a conservative, then a leftist independent. He was resolutely anti-Gaullist. Supported by all the left-wing parties, he obtained a good result and faced De Gaulle in an unexpected second ballot, becoming the leader of the non-Communist left.\n\nIn order to exist between the Communist Party, leading the left, and the [[Gaullist Party]], leading the country, the SFIO, Radicals, and left-wing republican groups created the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] under Mitterrand's leadership. But unable to benefit from the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] events, it imploded after its disastrous defeat at the [[1968 French legislative election|June 1968 legislative elections]]. One year later, the SFIO candidate [[Gaston Defferre]] was eliminated in the first round of the [[1969 French presidential election|1969 presidential election]], with only 5% of votes.\n\n===The foundation of the PS and the \"Union of the Left\" (1969\u20131981)===\nIn 1969, during the [[Alfortville Congress]], the SFIO was replaced by the Socialist Party (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). It was joined by pro-[[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]] clubs ([[Union of Clubs for the Renewal of the Left]] led by [[Alain Savary]]) and left-wing republican groups ([[Union of Socialist Groups and Clubs]] of [[Jean Poperen]]). During the Issy-les-Moulineaux Congress, Alain Savary was elected First Secretary with the support of his predecessor Guy Mollet. He proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists.\n\nTwo years later, during the [[Epinay Congress]], pro-Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand clubs ([[Convention of Republican Institutions]]), joined the party. Mitterrand defeated the Savary-Mollet duo by proposing an electoral programme with the Communists and took the lead. In 1972, the ''[[Programme commun|Common Programme]]'' was signed with the PCF and [[Radical Party of the Left]]. During the [[Socialist International]] conference, he explained the alliance of left-wing parties is a yearning of French left-wing voters. In this, the goal of his strategy was \"to regain 3&nbsp;million of the 5&nbsp;million of PCF voters\". The left, and notably the Socialist Party, experienced an electoral recovery at the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative election]]. Mitterrand, the candidate of the left-wing alliance, came close to winning the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]]. Indeed, he obtained 49.2% of votes in the second round.\n\nAt the end of 1974, some PSU members, including leader [[Michel Rocard]], re-joined the PS. They represented the \"left-wing Christian\" and non-Marxist group. The most conservative members of the PS, they advocated an alignment of French socialism along the lines of European [[social democracy]], that is, a clear acceptance of the [[market economy]]. While the \"Union of the Left\" triumphed at the 1977 municipal election, the electoral rise of the PS worried the Communist Party. The two parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'' and the PCF leader [[Georges Marchais]] denounced a \"turn towards the Right\" of the PS.\n\nIn spite of positive polls, the \"Union of the Left\" lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. For the first time since [[1936 French legislative election|1936]], the Socialists scored better in the polls than the Communists, becoming the main left-wing party, but their defeat caused an internal crisis. Mitterrand's leadership was challenged by Rocard, who wanted to abandon the ''Common Programme'' which he considered archaic and unrealistic. Mitterrand felt that the left could not win without the alliance between the Socialists and the Communists. In 1979, Mitterrand won the [[Metz Congress]], then, despite Rocard's popularity, was chosen as PS candidate for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nThree major tendencies or factions emerged within the PS by the end of the Seventies. One was represented by the Mitterrandists who wanted reform but not a complete break with capitalism. A second faction was led by [[Michel Rocard]] and his supporters, who sought social democracy with a strong measure of autogestion, while a third faction formed around [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] and the CERES group which stood for revolutionary socialism.<ref>Mitterrand: A Political Biography by Wayne Northcutt</ref>\n\n===Mitterrand's presidency and the exercise of power (1981\u20131995)===\nIn 1981 Mitterrand [[1981 French presidential election|defeated]] the incumbent conservative, [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], to become the first socialist of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] to be elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage. He dissolved the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and, for the first time in their history, the French Socialists won an absolute majority of the seats. This landslide victory for the Socialists took place to the detriment of the right-wing parliamentary parties ([[Rally for the Republic]] and [[Union for French Democracy]]), as well as the Communist Party.\n\nMitterrand attempted to carry out socialist-inspired reforms (the [[110 Propositions]]), furthering the ''[[dirigisme|dirigiste]]'' [[economic planning]] trends of the preceding conservative governments. The Prime Minister [[Pierre Mauroy]] [[nationalization|nationalised]] the banks, the insurance industry and the defence industries, in accordance with the 1972 ''[[Programme commun|Common Program]]''. Workers' wages were increased and working hours reduced to 39, and many other sweeping reforms carried out, but the economic crisis continued. Reforms included the [[Capital punishment in France|abolition of death penalty]], creation of a [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (ISF), introduction of [[proportional representation]] in legislative elections (which was applied only at the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 election]]), [[decentralization]] of the state (1982\u201383 laws), repeal of price liberalization for books ([[Lang Law]] of 1981), etc.\n\nAs early as 1982, Mitterrand faced a clear choice between maintaining France's membership in the [[European Monetary System]], and thus the country's commitment to [[European integration]], and pursuing his socialist reforms. He chose the former, starting the Socialist Party's acceptance of the private market economy. In 1984 Mitterrand and his second Prime Minister, [[Laurent Fabius]], clearly abandoned any further socialist measures. The \"Union of the Left\" died and the Communist ministers resigned. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of the Mitterrand presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Left's Dirty Job: The Politics of Industrial Restructuring in France and Spain|author=Smith, W.R.|date=1998|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=9780822971894|url=https://archive.org/details/leftsdirtyjobpol0000smit|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/leftsdirtyjobpol0000smit/page/102 102]|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe PS lost its majority in the French National Assembly in 1986, forcing Mitterrand to \"cohabit\" with the conservative government of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Nevertheless, Mitterrand was re-elected President in 1988 with a moderate programme entitled \"United France\". He proposed neither nationalisations nor [[privatisation]]s. He chose as Prime Minister the most popular and moderate of the Socialist politicians, Michel Rocard. His cabinet included four centre-right ministers but it was supported by only a plurality in the National Assembly elected in [[1988 French legislative election|June 1988]].\n\nDuring his second term, Mitterrand focused on foreign policy and European integration. He convened a referendum for the ratification of the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. He left domestic policy to his prime ministers: Michel Rocard, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] and [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]]. The party was hit by scandals about its financing and weakened by the struggle between the heirs of \"''Mitterrandism''\".\n\nIn 1990, during the [[Rennes Congress]], the \"''Mitterrandist'' group\" split between the supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and the friends of [[Lionel Jospin]]. Furthermore, a part of the left wing of the party, led by [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] split off due to his opposition to the [[Gulf War]] and the Maastricht Treaty. This section created the [[Citizen and Republican Movement]] (MDC). Finally, many on the left were disappointed by the results of the Socialist governments. At the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]], the PS did poorly, returning to the levels of the SFIO in the 1960s. The Socialist group of the National Assembly numbered 53 deputies against 260 during the previous term.\n\nRocard became First Secretary of the party, and was considered the \"natural candidate\" for the next presidential election. He called for a political \"big bang\", an agreement with the centre and the centre-right, but his efforts were in vain. One year later, his party obtained only 14% of votes at the [[1994 European Parliament election in France|1994 European Parliament election]]. He was overthrown by a motley coalition led by [[Henri Emmanuelli]], a \"Mitterrandist\" left-winger. One year before the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]], the PS was affected by a leadership crisis. Rocard lost the most part of his followers after his 1994 electoral crash, Fabius was weakened by the [[infected blood scandal (France)|infected blood scandal]], the presidentiability of Emannuelli was questioned. The hope of some party members transferred to [[Jacques Delors]], president of the [[European Commission]] and a favourite according to the polls, but he declined due to the radicalisation of the party which prevented his [[centrism|centrist]] strategy. Finally, [[Lionel Jospin]], who had announced his political retirement after the loss of his parliamentary seat in 1993, came back and proposed to \"take stock\" of Mitterrand's inheritance. For the first time, the party members were called to nominate their candidate for presidency. Benefiting from a good image in the polls, a strong loyalty to the party (as former First Secretary) and governmental experience (as former Education Minister, and the teachers were numerous and influential in the PS), he defeated Emmanuelli in the internal ballot. Then, he was defeated by [[Jacques Chirac]] in the run-off election but, given the PS crisis, his result was judged good and he returned as First Secretary.\n\n===Jospin and the \"Plural Left\" (1995\u20132002)===\nIn the legislature, the PS reconstructed a coalition with other left-wing parties: the [[French Communist Party]], the [[The Greens (France)|Greens]], the [[Radical Party of the Left]], and the MDC. This \"[[Plural Left]]\" won the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 legislative election]] and Jospin became Prime Minister of the third \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]\".\n\nHis policy was broadly progressive. The [[Aubry laws]] reduced the working time to 35 hours a week, while [[National health insurance|Universal medical insurance]] was instituted. However, the policy of privatisation was pursued.\n\nHis coalition dissolved when the MDC leader [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] resigned from the Cabinet. The Green and Communist allies were weakened by their governmental participation.\n\nThe [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] was focused on the theme of insecurity. Jospin, again the Socialists' candidate, was eliminated in the first round due to there being too many left-wing candidates who split the vote. He announced his retirement from politics, and the PS called on its supporters to vote for Chirac in order to defeat the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[National Front (France)|National Front]] leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], who had surprisingly advanced to the run-off. Two months later, the \"Plural Left\" lost the [[2002 French legislative elections|2002 legislative election]].\n\n===After the 2002 shock===\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], who became First Secretary in 1997, was re-elected in 2003 during the [[Dijon Congress]] with the support of the main Socialist personalities, against the left wing of the party. In the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], the Socialists had a major comeback. In coalition with the former \"Plural Left\", they gained power in 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions (all except [[Alsace]] and [[Corsica]]) and in the four overseas regions. The party benefited from increasing frustration with right-wing parties. However, the Socialist Party has experienced considerable difficulty in formulating an alternative to right-wing policy.\n\nOn 1 December 2004, 59% of Socialist Party members approved the proposed [[European Constitution]]. However, several well-known members of the Party, including [[Laurent Fabius]], and left-wingers [[Henri Emmanuelli]] and [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]], asked the public for a \"no\" vote in the 29 May 2005 [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], where the proposed Constitution was rejected. Fabius was ejected from the executive office of the party. The split over the European Constitution, as well as party leaders' competing ambitions to win the presidential nomination in 2007, led the party into considerable disarray.\n\nIn November 2005, during the [[Le Mans Congress]], three main groups were present. The majority supported a moderate text and obtained 55%. Fabius's allies (\"To Rally the Left\") advocated more radical policies and gained 20%. Finally, another faction (\"New Socialist Party\") claimed it was necessary to renovate the party by proposing left-wing policies and a profound reform of French institutions. It obtained 25% of the vote. Virtually all factions agreed on a common agenda, broadly based on the moderate and pro-European majority's position with some left-wing amendments.\n\n===2007 elections and their aftermath===\n{{See also|2006 French Socialist Party presidential primary}}\n[[File:Meeting Royal 2007 02 06 n1.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]] and [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] sitting in the front row at a meeting held on 6 Feb 2007 by the French Socialist Party at the Carpentier Hall in Paris.]]\nMany potential candidates appeared for the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]]: [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], [[Laurent Fabius]] (from the left wing of the party), [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] (who claimed to represent \"social democracy\"), [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], [[Martine Aubry]] and [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], who was favoured according to the polls. Some Socialist leaders asked Jospin to return. He declared he was \"available\" then finally refused.\n\nOn 16 November 2006, the members of the Socialist Party chose S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal to be their candidate with a majority of 60%. Her challengers, Strauss-Kahn and Fabius, obtained 21% and 19% respectively.\n\nAfter obtaining 25.87% of the vote in the first round of France's presidential elections, Royal qualified for the second round of voting but lost with 46.94% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] on 6 May 2007. Immediately after her defeat several party bosses (notably Strauss-Kahn), held S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal personally responsible for the unsuccessful campaign. At the same time, some personalities of the right wing of the party (such as [[Bernard Kouchner]]) accepted to join the government nominated by Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nIn the 10 and 17 June [[2007 French legislative election|2007 National Assembly elections]], the Socialist Party won 186 out of 577 seats, and about 10 affiliated, gain of 40 seats.\n\nAfter the winning March 2008 municipal election, the campaign with a view to the [[Reims Congress]] started. Some candidates proposed to succeed [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], who had announced he will not compete for another term as First Secretary:\n* S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal who wished to forge an alliance with the centrist party [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]];\n* the Mayor of Paris [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]], supported by [[Lionel Jospin]] and his friends, who wished to keep the status quo of the 2007 campaign and come back to the [[Plural Left]];\n* [[Martine Aubry]], supported by the followers of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], who had the same electoral strategy as the Mayor of Paris but advocated reconciliation between the campaigners of the \"yes\" and the \"no\" to the European constitution; and\n* the young left-winger [[Beno\u00eet Hamon]].\n\nIn the pre-vote, the text of Royal arrived the first with 29%, followed by Delano\u00eb (25%), Aubry (25%) and Hamon (19%). A part of the left wing split and founded the [[Left Party (France)|Left Party]]. During the [[Reims Congress]], which happened in a very tense climate, the leaders of the factions failed to form a majority. Consequently, the PS members had to elect directly the next First Secretary. Disappointed by his result in the pre-vote, Delano\u00eb renounced and called to vote for Aubry.\n\nOn 22 November 2008 it was announced that Aubry had defeated Royal by the narrow margin of 42 votes, and Royal asked for a recount. After checking, [[Martine Aubry]] was elected by a margin of 102 votes and 50.03% of votes. Denouncing frauds, Royal's team threatened to lodge a complaint before to renounce.\n\nAfter that, the public image of the party was deteriorated. In the [[2009 European Parliament election in France|2009 European Parliament election]], the PS did not succeed to benefit from the unpopularity of President Sarkozy. It obtained only 16.5% of the vote and only just got ahead of [[Europe Ecologie|Europe Ecology]] (16.3%). However, the PS strengthened its network of local elects in winning comfortably the 2010 departmental and regional elections. In September 2011, for the first time a Socialist, [[Jean-Pierre Bel]], was elected Chairman of the [[Senate of France]].\n\n===2012 elections===\n{{See also|French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|French presidential election, 2012}}\nCandidates for the presidency of France contested an open primary on 9 October 2011 to select the Socialist Party candidate for the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]]. The nominations for the candidacy were opened on 28 June. Though he had not officially declared his candidacy, [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], a prominent member of the Socialist Party and the managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] was the polls' clear favorite to defeat the incumbent conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/09/uk-france-politics-poll-idUKTRE7472CX20110509 |title=France's Sarkozy may not make 2012 runoff &#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |accessdate=7 July 2011 |date=9 May 2011}}</ref> But he faced a [[New York v.

Hamon finished 5th in the subsequent Presidential election, with 6.36% of the vote. In the 2017 legislative election that followed the election of President [[Emmanuel Macron]], the Socialist party dropped from 280 to 30 seats in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], leaving it in 4th place in terms of seats, and with 7.44% of the 1st round vote. The Parliamentary left group that it dominated (with 30 out of 45 seats after the election, down from 280 out of 331 seats before) finished as the 3rd largest group in the National Assembly. Following the election, Cambad\u00e9lis resigned from the post of first secretary and Rachid Temal was appointed as acting secretary. The Socialist group was ultimately refounded as the \"[[New Left group|New Left]]\" (NG).\n\nOn 1 July 2017 Hamon left the Socialist Party and founded the [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ration.s|1st July Movement]] (later renamed G\u00e9n\u00e9ration.s). The Socialist Party abstained from the confidence vote on the [[Second Philippe government]]. The party later elected 78 senators in the [[2017 French Senate election|2017 election.]] \n\nOn 7\u20138 April 2018 the [[Aubervilliers Congress]] elected [[Olivier Faure]] as new first secretary of the party; Faure announced the party would be in opposition to Macron and Philippe. Because of financial problems, the party was forced to sell its historical seat in [[Rue de Solf\u00e9rino]] and moved into a smaller one in [[Rue Moli\u00e8re]], on [[Ivry-sur-Seine]].\n\nFollowing the Benalla affair, the Socialist Party entered a [[motion of no confidence]] against the government, together with the [[French Communist Party]] and [[La France Insoumise]]. The motions obtained 63 ayes and failed to reach the quorum of 289 votes required in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].\n\nIn 2018 the New Left group changed its name into ''Socialists and affiliated group''.\n\nOn 12 October 2018 MEP [[Emmanuel Maurel]] left the party together with other elected officials and founded the [[Alternative for a republican, ecologist and socialist program]] (APR\u00c9S).\n\nFor the [[2019 European Parliament election in France|2019 European election]], the Socialist Party formed a joint list with the [[Radical Party of the Left]], [[Place Publique]] and [[New Deal (France)|New Deal]], with [[Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann]] at its head. The list scored 6,19% of votes and elected three MEPs.\n\n==Leadership==\nFirst secretaries since 1969:\n*[[Alain Savary]] (1969\u20131971)\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] (1971\u20131981)\n*[[Lionel Jospin]] (1981\u20131988)\n*[[Pierre Mauroy]] (1988\u20131992)\n*[[Laurent Fabius]] (1992\u20131993)\n*[[Michel Rocard]] (1993\u20131994)\n*[[Henri Emmanuelli]] (1994\u20131995)\n*[[Lionel Jospin]] (1995\u20131997)\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] (1997\u20132008)\n*[[Martine Aubry]] (2008\u20132012)\n*[[Harlem D\u00e9sir]] ''(Acting in 2011,<ref>Appointed on 30 June 2011, acting during Martine Aubry's candidacy in the [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011]].</ref> 2012\u20132014)''\n*[[Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis]] (2014\u20132017)\n*[[Rachid Temal]] (acting in 2017\u20132018)\n*[[Olivier Faure]] (2018\u2013present)\n\n==Factions==\nFactions are organised in the Socialist Party through policy declarations called ''motions'' on which the party members vote at each Congress:\n*'''[[Royalists (French Socialist Party)|Royalists]]''' (moderate [[social democracy]]): [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], [[G\u00e9rard Collomb]], [[Jean-No\u00ebl Gu\u00e9rini]], [[Ga\u00ebtan Gorce]], [[Jean-Louis Bianco]], [[Julien Dray]], [[Vincent Peillon]], [[Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti]], [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mandroux]], [[Jean-Jack Queyranne]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen]], [[Manuel Valls]]\n*'''[[Aubryists]]''' ([[Christian left]], [[social democracy]]): [[Martine Aubry]], Fran\u00e7ois Lamy, [[Sandrine Mazetier]], [[Pierre Mauroy]], [[Paulette Guinchard-Kunstler]], [[Adeline Hazan]], [[Arnaud Montebourg]] ([[Renovate Now]])\n* '''Fabiusians''' ([[progressivism]], [[democratic socialism]]): [[Laurent Fabius]], [[Claude Bartolone]], [[Marylise Lebranchu]], [[Alain Le Vern]], [[Alain Vidalies]], [[Marie-No\u00eblle Lienemann]]\n*'''Delanoistes''' ([[social liberalism]]): [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]], [[Lionel Jospin]], [[Michel Rocard]], [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]], [[\u00c9lisabeth Guigou]], [[Michel Sapin]], [[Alain Rousset]], [[Harlem D\u00e9sir]], [[Pierre Cohen]], [[Michel Destot]], [[Roland Ries]]\n*'''[[New Socialist Party (France)|New Socialist Party]]''' ([[democratic socialism]]): [[Henri Emmanuelli]], [[Beno\u00eet Hamon]], [[Jacques Fleury]], [[Michel Vergnier]], [[Andr\u00e9 Lejeune]], [[Paul Quil\u00e8s]]\n*'''[[Eco-socialists]]''' ([[eco-socialism]]): [[Christophe Caresche]], [[Jean-Louis Tourenne]], [[Nicole Bricq]], [[Genevi\u00e8ve Gaillard]], [[Philippe Tourtelier]]\n\n== Election results ==\nThe PS's pattern of support has evolved significantly since its creation and since the days of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO). However, certain strongholds remain remarkably stable. For example, the PS dominates the rural areas of the south-west of France (notably the [[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), an old SFIO base. These rural regions voted Socialist as a protest against Parisian [[centralism]], though they were amongst the first republican and ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9|la\u00efc]]'' regions of France.\n\nWhile the PS used to be weak in the major wealthy urban centres of the southwest, such as [[Toulouse]], the PS has made gains with middle class urban voters nationwide and is the largest party in almost all major French cities.\n\nThe PS is also strong in areas which used to be strongholds of the [[French Communist Party]]: the mining and industrial areas of the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], the left-wing rural [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]], and various industrial centres.\n\nIn recent years, thanks to urbanisation and most notably the decline of religious practice, it has made significant gains in regions such as [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] or the [[Pays de la Loire]]. For example, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal won the Breton department of [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] with 52.39%<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/053/035/5335.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}</ref> \u2013 while losing nationally \u2013 while Mitterrand has won only 38.88% in 1974 (49.19% nationwide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|title= Results on the CDSP website|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120604090721/http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|archivedate= 4 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref> This trend has also been observed in Catholic departments such as [[Loz\u00e8re]], Cantal and [[Haute-Loire]] (though the Socialists were already strong in secular logging areas).\n\nPast support in rural region [[Provence]], such as in the [[Var (department)|Var]] (formerly the \"Red Var\") has practically evaporated with the influx of wealthier residents, [[Pied-Noir]] and [[pensioner]]s. Ironically, the region is now one of the PS' worst regions.\n\nThe PS is also strong in the department of the [[Ni\u00e8vre]], Mitterrand's electoral base.\n\n=== Presidential elections  ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Election year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Candidate\n! colspan=\"3\"| 1st round\n! colspan=\"3\"| 2nd round\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Rank\n!Votes\n!%\n!Rank\n|-\n!

The PS used to be one of the two major political parties in the French Fifth Republic, along with [[The Republicans (France)|the Republicans]]. The Socialist Party replaced the earlier [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) in 1969, and is currently led by First Secretary [[Olivier Faure]]. The PS is a member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES), the [[Socialist International]] (SI) and the [[Progressive Alliance]].\n\nThe PS first won power in 1981, when its candidate [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected [[President of France]] in the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. Under Mitterrand, the party achieved a governing majority in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1993. PS leader [[Lionel Jospin]] lost his bid to succeed Mitterrand as president in the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] against [[Rally for the Republic]] leader [[Jacques Chirac]], but became prime minister in a [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation government]] after the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 parliamentary elections]], a position Jospin held until 2002, when he was again defeated in the [[2002 French presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nIn 2007, the party's candidate for [[2007 French presidential election|the presidential election]], [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], was defeated by conservative UMP candidate [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. Then, the Socialist party won most of [[Municipal elections in France|regional]] and local elections and it [[2011 French Senate election|won control]] of the [[Senate of France|Senate]] in 2011 for the first time in more than fifty years.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/25/us-france-senate-idUSTRE78O2G620110925 | work=Reuters | first=Catherine | last=Bremer | title=French left seizes Senate majority, hurts Sarkozy | date=25 September 2011}}</ref> On 6 May 2012, [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], the First Secretary of the Socialist Party from 1997 to 2008, was elected President of France, and the next month, the party [[2012 French legislative election|won the majority in the National Assembly]].\n\nDuring his term, Hollande battled with high unemployment, poor opinion ratings and a splinter group of left-wing Socialist MPs known as \"frondeurs\". On 1 December 2016, Hollande declined to seek re-election and the PS subsequently organized a [[2017 French Socialist Party presidential primary|presidential primary]]. Left-wing [[Beno\u00eet Hamon|Benoit Hamon]] was designated as the Socialist candidate after defeating former PM [[Manuel Valls]]. Facing the emergence of centrist [[Emmanuel Macron]] and leftist [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]], he failed to re-establish the PS leadership on the centre-left and finished 5th in the [[2017 French presidential election]], gathering only 6.36 percent of the votes. The party then lost the majority of its MPs in the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]], securing 26 seats and becoming the fourth-biggest group in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly.]]\n\nThe PS also formed several figures who acted at the international level: [[Jacques Delors]], who was the [[President of the European Commission#List of presidents|eighth President of the European Commission]] from 1985 to 1994 and the first person to serve three terms in that office, was from the Socialist Party,<ref name=\"europa1\">{{Citation | title = European Commission \u2013 Discover the former Presidents | url = http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/delors/index_en.htm | accessdate = 21 September 2009}}</ref> as well as [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], who was the [[Managing Director]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]] from 2007 to 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/chron/mds.asp|title=IMF Managing Directors|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> and [[Pascal Lamy]], who was [[Director-General of the World Trade Organization|Director-General]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] from 2005 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/dg_e/exdgs_e.htm |title=Previous GATT and WTO Directors-General |publisher=WTO |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe party had 42,300 members in 2016,<ref name=\"2017-members\" /> down from 60,000 in 2014<ref name=members>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/11/30/97001-20141130FILWWW00046-60000-militants-ps-a-jour-de-cotisations.php|title=PS : 60.000 militants PS \u00e0 jour de cotisations|publisher=Parti socialiste|date=2014-11-30|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> and 173,486 members in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parti-socialiste.fr/static/8455/documents/harlem-desir-et-emmanuel-maurel-candidats-au-poste-de-premier-secretaire.pdf|title=PS: R\u00e9sultats officiels valid\u00e9s|publisher=Socialist Party|date=12 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101034540/http://www.parti-socialiste.fr/static/8455/documents/harlem-desir-et-emmanuel-maurel-candidats-au-poste-de-premier-secretaire.pdf|archivedate=1 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\n\n===French socialist movement until 1969===\n{{main|French Section of the Workers' International}}\nThe defeat of the [[Paris commune]] (1871) greatly reduced the power and influence of the socialist movements in France. Its leaders were killed or exiled. France's first socialist party, the [[Federation of the Socialist Workers of France]], was founded in 1879. It was characterised as \"possibilist\" because it promoted [[Reformism|gradual reforms]]. Two parties split off from it: in 1882, the [[French Workers' Party]] of [[Jules Guesde]] and [[Paul Lafargue]] (the son-in-law of [[Karl Marx]]), then in 1890 the [[Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (France)|Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party]] of [[Jean Allemane]]. At the same time, the heirs of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], a symbol of the French revolutionary tradition, created the [[Central Revolutionary Committee]] led by [[\u00c9douard Vaillant]]. There were also some declared socialist deputies such as [[Alexandre Millerand]] and [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] who did not belong to any party.\n\nIn 1899, the participation of Millerand in [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau]]'s cabinet caused a debate about socialist participation in a \"bourgeois government\". Three years later, Jaur\u00e8s, Allemane and the possibilists founded the possibilist [[French Socialist Party (1902)|French Socialist Party]], which supported participation in government, while Guesde and Vaillant formed the [[Socialist Party of France (1902)|Socialist Party of France]], which opposed such co-operation. In 1905, during the [[Globe Congress]], the two groups merged in the [[French Section of the Workers International]] (SFIO). Leader of the parliamentary group and director of the party paper ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', Jaur\u00e8s was its most influential figure.\n\nThe party was hemmed in between the [[Liberal elite|middle-class liberals]] of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] and the revolutionary [[syndicalism|syndicalists]] who dominated the trade unions. Furthermore, the goal to rally all the Socialists in one single party was partially reached: some elects refused to join the SFIO and created the [[Republican-Socialist Party]], which supported socialist participation in liberal governments. Together with the Radicals, who wished to install [[La\u00efcit\u00e9|laicism]], the SFIO was a component of the Left Block (''[[Bloc des gauches]]'') without to sit in the government. In 1906, the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] trade union claimed its independence from all political parties.\n\nThe French socialists were strongly anti-war, but following the assassination of Jaur\u00e8s in 1914 they were unable to resist the wave of militarism which followed the outbreak of World War I. They suffered a severe split over participation in the wartime government of national unity. In 1919 the anti-war socialists were heavily defeated in elections. In 1920, during the [[Tours Congress]], the majority and left wing of the party broke away and formed the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] to join the [[Comintern|Third International]] founded by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The right wing, led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], kept the \"old house\" and remained in the SFIO.\n\nIn 1924 and in 1932, the Socialists joined with the Radicals in the Coalition of the Left (''[[Cartel des Gauches]]''), but refused to join the non-Socialist governments led by the Radicals [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier]]. These governments failed because the Socialists and the Radicals could not agree on economic policy, and also because the Communists, following the [[Third Period|policy]] laid down by the Soviet Union, refused to support governments presiding over capitalist economies. The question of the possibility of a government participation with Radicals caused the split of \"neosocialists\" at the beginning of the 1930s. They merged with the [[Republican-Socialist Party]] in the [[Socialist Republican Union]].\n\nIn 1934, the Communists changed their line, and the four left-wing parties came together in the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], which won the 1936 elections and brought Blum to power as France's first SFIO Prime Minister. Indeed, for the first time in its history, the SFIO obtained more votes and seats than the Radical Party and it formed the central axis of a left-wing parliamentary majority. Within a year, however, his government collapsed over economic policy and also over the issue of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The fall of the Popular Front caused a new split from the SFIO, with the departure of the left wing of the party, led by [[Marceau Pivert]], to the [[Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party]]. The demoralised Left fell apart and was unable to resist the collapse of the [[French Third Republic]] after the military defeat of 1940.\n\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, the SFIO re-emerged in a coalition with a powerful [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), which became the largest left-wing party, and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP). This alliance installed the main elements of the French [[welfare state]] and the [[French Fourth Republic]], but it did not survive the Cold War. In May 1947, the Socialist Prime Minister [[Paul Ramadier]] dismissed the Communist ministers. Blum proposed the construction of a [[Third Force (France)|Third Force]] with the centre-left and the centre-right, against the Gaullists and the Communists. However, his candidate to lead of the SFIO, [[Daniel Mayer]], was defeated by [[Guy Mollet]].\n\nMollet was supported by the left wing of the party. Paradoxically, he spoke a [[Marxism|Marxist]] language without questioning the alliance with the centre and the centre-right. His leadership was shaken when the party divided in 1954 about the [[European Defence Community]] (the half of the SFIO parliamentary group voted \"no\", against the instructions of the party lead, participating to the failure of the project). But later, Mollet got involved the SFIO in the build of a centre-left coalition, the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], which won a plurality in the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 elections]]. Consequently, he was Prime Minister at the head of a minority government. But the party was in decline, as were the Radicals, and the left never came close to forming a united front. Indeed, this led Mollet to assert, \"the Communist Party is not on the left, but in the East\". The repressive policy of Mollet in the [[Algerian War]] and his support for [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s come-back in 1958 (the party lead called to vote \"yes\" in referendum on [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]'s constitution) caused a split and the foundation of the dissident [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU). The SFIO returned to opposition in 1959. Discredited by its fluctuating policy during the Fourth Republic, it reached its lowest ebb in the 1960s.\n\nBoth because of its opposition to the principle of presidential election by [[universal suffrage]] and because De Gaulle's re-election appeared inevitable, the SFIO did not nominate a candidate for the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]]. Consequently, it supported the candidacy of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], a former minister of the Fourth Republic who had been a conservative, then a leftist independent. He was resolutely anti-Gaullist. Supported by all the left-wing parties, he obtained a good result and faced De Gaulle in an unexpected second ballot, becoming the leader of the non-Communist left.\n\nIn order to exist between the Communist Party, leading the left, and the [[Gaullist Party]], leading the country, the SFIO, Radicals, and left-wing republican groups created the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] under Mitterrand's leadership. But unable to benefit from the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] events, it imploded after its disastrous defeat at the [[1968 French legislative election|June 1968 legislative elections]]. One year later, the SFIO candidate [[Gaston Defferre]] was eliminated in the first round of the [[1969 French presidential election|1969 presidential election]], with only 5% of votes.\n\n===The foundation of the PS and the \"Union of the Left\" (1969\u20131981)===\nIn 1969, during the [[Alfortville Congress]], the SFIO was replaced by the Socialist Party (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). It was joined by pro-[[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]] clubs ([[Union of Clubs for the Renewal of the Left]] led by [[Alain Savary]]) and left-wing republican groups ([[Union of Socialist Groups and Clubs]] of [[Jean Poperen]]). During the Issy-les-Moulineaux Congress, Alain Savary was elected First Secretary with the support of his predecessor Guy Mollet. He proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists.\n\nTwo years later, during the [[Epinay Congress]], pro-Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand clubs ([[Convention of Republican Institutions]]), joined the party. Mitterrand defeated the Savary-Mollet duo by proposing an electoral programme with the Communists and took the lead. In 1972, the ''[[Programme commun|Common Programme]]'' was signed with the PCF and [[Radical Party of the Left]]. During the [[Socialist International]] conference, he explained the alliance of left-wing parties is a yearning of French left-wing voters. In this, the goal of his strategy was \"to regain 3&nbsp;million of the 5&nbsp;million of PCF voters\". The left, and notably the Socialist Party, experienced an electoral recovery at the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative election]]. Mitterrand, the candidate of the left-wing alliance, came close to winning the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]]. Indeed, he obtained 49.2% of votes in the second round.\n\nAt the end of 1974, some PSU members, including leader [[Michel Rocard]], re-joined the PS. They represented the \"left-wing Christian\" and non-Marxist group. The most conservative members of the PS, they advocated an alignment of French socialism along the lines of European [[social democracy]], that is, a clear acceptance of the [[market economy]]. While the \"Union of the Left\" triumphed at the 1977 municipal election, the electoral rise of the PS worried the Communist Party. The two parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'' and the PCF leader [[Georges Marchais]] denounced a \"turn towards the Right\" of the PS.\n\nIn spite of positive polls, the \"Union of the Left\" lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. For the first time since [[1936 French legislative election|1936]], the Socialists scored better in the polls than the Communists, becoming the main left-wing party, but their defeat caused an internal crisis. Mitterrand's leadership was challenged by Rocard, who wanted to abandon the ''Common Programme'' which he considered archaic and unrealistic. Mitterrand felt that the left could not win without the alliance between the Socialists and the Communists. In 1979, Mitterrand won the [[Metz Congress]], then, despite Rocard's popularity, was chosen as PS candidate for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nThree major tendencies or factions emerged within the PS by the end of the Seventies. One was represented by the Mitterrandists who wanted reform but not a complete break with capitalism. A second faction was led by [[Michel Rocard]] and his supporters, who sought social democracy with a strong measure of autogestion, while a third faction formed around [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] and the CERES group which stood for revolutionary socialism.<ref>Mitterrand: A Political Biography by Wayne Northcutt</ref>\n\n===Mitterrand's presidency and the exercise of power (1981\u20131995)===\nIn 1981 Mitterrand [[1981 French presidential election|defeated]] the incumbent conservative, [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], to become the first socialist of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] to be elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage. He dissolved the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and, for the first time in their history, the French Socialists won an absolute majority of the seats. This landslide victory for the Socialists took place to the detriment of the right-wing parliamentary parties ([[Rally for the Republic]] and [[Union for French Democracy]]), as well as the Communist Party.\n\nMitterrand attempted to carry out socialist-inspired reforms (the [[110 Propositions]]), furthering the ''[[dirigisme|dirigiste]]'' [[economic planning]] trends of the preceding conservative governments. The Prime Minister [[Pierre Mauroy]] [[nationalization|nationalised]] the banks, the insurance industry and the defence industries, in accordance with the 1972 ''[[Programme commun|Common Program]]''. Workers' wages were increased and working hours reduced to 39, and many other sweeping reforms carried out, but the economic crisis continued. Reforms included the [[Capital punishment in France|abolition of death penalty]], creation of a [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (ISF), introduction of [[proportional representation]] in legislative elections (which was applied only at the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 election]]), [[decentralization]] of the state (1982\u201383 laws), repeal of price liberalization for books ([[Lang Law]] of 1981), etc.\n\nAs early as 1982, Mitterrand faced a clear choice between maintaining France's membership in the [[European Monetary System]], and thus the country's commitment to [[European integration]], and pursuing his socialist reforms. He chose the former, starting the Socialist Party's acceptance of the private market economy. In 1984 Mitterrand and his second Prime Minister, [[Laurent Fabius]], clearly abandoned any further socialist measures. The \"Union of the Left\" died and the Communist ministers resigned. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of the Mitterrand presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Left's Dirty Job: The Politics of Industrial Restructuring in France and Spain|author=Smith, W.R.|date=1998|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=9780822971894|url=https://archive.org/details/leftsdirtyjobpol0000smit|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/leftsdirtyjobpol0000smit/page/102 102]|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe PS lost its majority in the French National Assembly in 1986, forcing Mitterrand to \"cohabit\" with the conservative government of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Nevertheless, Mitterrand was re-elected President in 1988 with a moderate programme entitled \"United France\". He proposed neither nationalisations nor [[privatisation]]s. He chose as Prime Minister the most popular and moderate of the Socialist politicians, Michel Rocard. His cabinet included four centre-right ministers but it was supported by only a plurality in the National Assembly elected in [[1988 French legislative election|June 1988]].\n\nDuring his second term, Mitterrand focused on foreign policy and European integration. He convened a referendum for the ratification of the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. He left domestic policy to his prime ministers: Michel Rocard, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] and [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]]. The party was hit by scandals about its financing and weakened by the struggle between the heirs of \"''Mitterrandism''\".\n\nIn 1990, during the [[Rennes Congress]], the \"''Mitterrandist'' group\" split between the supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and the friends of [[Lionel Jospin]]. Furthermore, a part of the left wing of the party, led by [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] split off due to his opposition to the [[Gulf War]] and the Maastricht Treaty. This section created the [[Citizen and Republican Movement]] (MDC). Finally, many on the left were disappointed by the results of the Socialist governments. At the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]], the PS did poorly, returning to the levels of the SFIO in the 1960s. The Socialist group of the National Assembly numbered 53 deputies against 260 during the previous term.\n\nRocard became First Secretary of the party, and was considered the \"natural candidate\" for the next presidential election. He called for a political \"big bang\", an agreement with the centre and the centre-right, but his efforts were in vain. One year later, his party obtained only 14% of votes at the [[1994 European Parliament election in France|1994 European Parliament election]]. He was overthrown by a motley coalition led by [[Henri Emmanuelli]], a \"Mitterrandist\" left-winger. One year before the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]], the PS was affected by a leadership crisis. Rocard lost the most part of his followers after his 1994 electoral crash, Fabius was weakened by the [[infected blood scandal (France)|infected blood scandal]], the presidentiability of Emannuelli was questioned. The hope of some party members transferred to [[Jacques Delors]], president of the [[European Commission]] and a favourite according to the polls, but he declined due to the radicalisation of the party which prevented his [[centrism|centrist]] strategy. Finally, [[Lionel Jospin]], who had announced his political retirement after the loss of his parliamentary seat in 1993, came back and proposed to \"take stock\" of Mitterrand's inheritance. For the first time, the party members were called to nominate their candidate for presidency. Benefiting from a good image in the polls, a strong loyalty to the party (as former First Secretary) and governmental experience (as former Education Minister, and the teachers were numerous and influential in the PS), he defeated Emmanuelli in the internal ballot. Then, he was defeated by [[Jacques Chirac]] in the run-off election but, given the PS crisis, his result was judged good and he returned as First Secretary.\n\n===Jospin and the \"Plural Left\" (1995\u20132002)===\nIn the legislature, the PS reconstructed a coalition with other left-wing parties: the [[French Communist Party]], the [[The Greens (France)|Greens]], the [[Radical Party of the Left]], and the MDC. This \"[[Plural Left]]\" won the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 legislative election]] and Jospin became Prime Minister of the third \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]\".\n\nHis policy was broadly progressive. The [[Aubry laws]] reduced the working time to 35 hours a week, while [[National health insurance|Universal medical insurance]] was instituted. However, the policy of privatisation was pursued.\n\nHis coalition dissolved when the MDC leader [[Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement]] resigned from the Cabinet. The Green and Communist allies were weakened by their governmental participation.\n\nThe [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] was focused on the theme of insecurity. Jospin, again the Socialists' candidate, was eliminated in the first round due to there being too many left-wing candidates who split the vote. He announced his retirement from politics, and the PS called on its supporters to vote for Chirac in order to defeat the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[National Front (France)|National Front]] leader [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], who had surprisingly advanced to the run-off. Two months later, the \"Plural Left\" lost the [[2002 French legislative elections|2002 legislative election]].\n\n===After the 2002 shock===\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], who became First Secretary in 1997, was re-elected in 2003 during the [[Dijon Congress]] with the support of the main Socialist personalities, against the left wing of the party. In the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], the Socialists had a major comeback. In coalition with the former \"Plural Left\", they gained power in 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions (all except [[Alsace]] and [[Corsica]]) and in the four overseas regions. The party benefited from increasing frustration with right-wing parties. However, the Socialist Party has experienced considerable difficulty in formulating an alternative to right-wing policy.\n\nOn 1 December 2004, 59% of Socialist Party members approved the proposed [[European Constitution]]. However, several well-known members of the Party, including [[Laurent Fabius]], and left-wingers [[Henri Emmanuelli]] and [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]], asked the public for a \"no\" vote in the 29 May 2005 [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], where the proposed Constitution was rejected. Fabius was ejected from the executive office of the party. The split over the European Constitution, as well as party leaders' competing ambitions to win the presidential nomination in 2007, led the party into considerable disarray.\n\nIn November 2005, during the [[Le Mans Congress]], three main groups were present. The majority supported a moderate text and obtained 55%. Fabius's allies (\"To Rally the Left\") advocated more radical policies and gained 20%. Finally, another faction (\"New Socialist Party\") claimed it was necessary to renovate the party by proposing left-wing policies and a profound reform of French institutions. It obtained 25% of the vote. Virtually all factions agreed on a common agenda, broadly based on the moderate and pro-European majority's position with some left-wing amendments.\n\n===2007 elections and their aftermath===\n{{See also|2006 French Socialist Party presidential primary}}\n[[File:Meeting Royal 2007 02 06 n1.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]] and [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] sitting in the front row at a meeting held on 6 Feb 2007 by the French Socialist Party at the Carpentier Hall in Paris.]]\nMany potential candidates appeared for the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]]: [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], [[Laurent Fabius]] (from the left wing of the party), [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] (who claimed to represent \"social democracy\"), [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], [[Martine Aubry]] and [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], who was favoured according to the polls. Some Socialist leaders asked Jospin to return. He declared he was \"available\" then finally refused.\n\nOn 16 November 2006, the members of the Socialist Party chose S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal to be their candidate with a majority of 60%. Her challengers, Strauss-Kahn and Fabius, obtained 21% and 19% respectively.\n\nAfter obtaining 25.87% of the vote in the first round of France's presidential elections, Royal qualified for the second round of voting but lost with 46.94% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] on 6 May 2007. Immediately after her defeat several party bosses (notably Strauss-Kahn), held S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal personally responsible for the unsuccessful campaign. At the same time, some personalities of the right wing of the party (such as [[Bernard Kouchner]]) accepted to join the government nominated by Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nIn the 10 and 17 June [[2007 French legislative election|2007 National Assembly elections]], the Socialist Party won 186 out of 577 seats, and about 10 affiliated, gain of 40 seats.\n\nAfter the winning March 2008 municipal election, the campaign with a view to the [[Reims Congress]] started. Some candidates proposed to succeed [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], who had announced he will not compete for another term as First Secretary:\n* S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal who wished to forge an alliance with the centrist party [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]];\n* the Mayor of Paris [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]], supported by [[Lionel Jospin]] and his friends, who wished to keep the status quo of the 2007 campaign and come back to the [[Plural Left]];\n* [[Martine Aubry]], supported by the followers of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], who had the same electoral strategy as the Mayor of Paris but advocated reconciliation between the campaigners of the \"yes\" and the \"no\" to the European constitution; and\n* the young left-winger [[Beno\u00eet Hamon]].\n\nIn the pre-vote, the text of Royal arrived the first with 29%, followed by Delano\u00eb (25%), Aubry (25%) and Hamon (19%). A part of the left wing split and founded the [[Left Party (France)|Left Party]]. During the [[Reims Congress]], which happened in a very tense climate, the leaders of the factions failed to form a majority. Consequently, the PS members had to elect directly the next First Secretary. Disappointed by his result in the pre-vote, Delano\u00eb renounced and called to vote for Aubry.\n\nOn 22 November 2008 it was announced that Aubry had defeated Royal by the narrow margin of 42 votes, and Royal asked for a recount. After checking, [[Martine Aubry]] was elected by a margin of 102 votes and 50.03% of votes. Denouncing frauds, Royal's team threatened to lodge a complaint before to renounce.\n\nAfter that, the public image of the party was deteriorated. In the [[2009 European Parliament election in France|2009 European Parliament election]], the PS did not succeed to benefit from the unpopularity of President Sarkozy. It obtained only 16.5% of the vote and only just got ahead of [[Europe Ecologie|Europe Ecology]] (16.3%). However, the PS strengthened its network of local elects in winning comfortably the 2010 departmental and regional elections. In September 2011, for the first time a Socialist, [[Jean-Pierre Bel]], was elected Chairman of the [[Senate of France]].\n\n===2012 elections===\n{{See also|French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|French presidential election, 2012}}\nCandidates for the presidency of France contested an open primary on 9 October 2011 to select the Socialist Party candidate for the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]]. The nominations for the candidacy were opened on 28 June. Though he had not officially declared his candidacy, [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], a prominent member of the Socialist Party and the managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] was the polls' clear favorite to defeat the incumbent conservative president, Nicolas Sarkozy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/09/uk-france-politics-poll-idUKTRE7472CX20110509 |title=France's Sarkozy may not make 2012 runoff &#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |accessdate=7 July 2011 |date=9 May 2011}}</ref> But he faced a [[New York v. Strauss-Kahn|sex assault complaint in New York]] and was ''de facto'' eliminated from the primary.\n\nEventually, former party leader [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] won the primary and ran as the official Socialist Party candidate for President of France. He narrowly defeated incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy, becoming president-elect of France on Sunday 6 May 2012.\n\nThe idea for holding an open primary to choose the Socialist Party presidential candidate had first been suggested in 2008, by the independent left-leaning think tank [[Terra Nova (think tank)|Terra Nova]].<ref name=\"tnova\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tnova.fr/essai/pour-une-primaire-la-fran-aise|title=Pour une primaire \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise &#124; Terra Nova|publisher=tnova.fr|accessdate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122103828/http://www.tnova.fr/essai/pour-une-primaire-la-fran-aise|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===2017 elections===\n[[File:Solf\u00e9rino PS.jpg|thumb|right|Rue de Solf\u00e9rino: seat of the Socialist Party, in Paris, which was sold to Apsys in December 2017 for 45.55 million euros.]]\n{{See also|French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2017|French presidential election, 2017|French legislative election, 2017}}\nThe Socialist Party decided to hold a presidential primary in 2017, against the backdrop of the unprecedented unpopularity of incumbent [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], with a 4 percent approval rating, who announced on 1 December 2016 that he would not seek re-election, making him the first president of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] not to seek a second term. It was also set against the fragmentation of the left between three major candidates, with polls indicating that the party's candidate would come in fifth, behind the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]'s [[Marine Le Pen]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]] of the centre-right [[The Republicans (France)|Republicans]], [[Emmanuel Macron]], former economy minister under Hollande who founded his centrist political movement, ''[[En Marche!]]'', and left-wing ex-Socialist [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon]] under the banner of [[La France insoumise]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Pierre Brian\u00e7on|title=French Socialists in chaos as Valls confronts Hollande|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/french-socialists-chaos-manuel-valls-confronts-francois-hollande/|publisher=Politico Europe|date=28 November 2016|accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref> The primary was won by Socialist rebel [[Beno\u00eet Hamon]], who defeated ex-Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] in the second round of the primary on 29 January 2017. Hamon finished 5th in the subsequent Presidential election, with 6.36% of the vote. In the 2017 legislative election that followed the election of President [[Emmanuel Macron]], the Socialist party dropped from 280 to 30 seats in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], leaving it in 4th place in terms of seats, and with 7.44% of the 1st round vote. The Parliamentary left group that it dominated (with 30 out of 45 seats after the election, down from 280 out of 331 seats before) finished as the 3rd largest group in the National Assembly. Following the election, Cambad\u00e9lis resigned from the post of first secretary and Rachid Temal was appointed as acting secretary. The Socialist group was ultimately refounded as the \"[[New Left group|New Left]]\" (NG).\n\nOn 1 July 2017 Hamon left the Socialist Party and founded the [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ration.s|1st July Movement]] (later renamed G\u00e9n\u00e9ration.s). The Socialist Party abstained from the confidence vote on the [[Second Philippe government]]. The party later elected 78 senators in the [[2017 French Senate election|2017 election.]] \n\nOn 7\u20138 April 2018 the [[Aubervilliers Congress]] elected [[Olivier Faure]] as new first secretary of the party; Faure announced the party would be in opposition to Macron and Philippe. Because of financial problems, the party was forced to sell its historical seat in [[Rue de Solf\u00e9rino]] and moved into a smaller one in [[Rue Moli\u00e8re]], on [[Ivry-sur-Seine]].\n\nFollowing the Benalla affair, the Socialist Party entered a [[motion of no confidence]] against the government, together with the [[French Communist Party]] and [[La France Insoumise]]. The motions obtained 63 ayes and failed to reach the quorum of 289 votes required in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].\n\nIn 2018 the New Left group changed its name into ''Socialists and affiliated group''.\n\nOn 12 October 2018 MEP [[Emmanuel Maurel]] left the party together with other elected officials and founded the [[Alternative for a republican, ecologist and socialist program]] (APR\u00c9S).\n\nFor the [[2019 European Parliament election in France|2019 European election]], the Socialist Party formed a joint list with the [[Radical Party of the Left]], [[Place Publique]] and [[New Deal (France)|New Deal]], with [[Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann]] at its head.

However, certain strongholds remain remarkably stable. For example, the PS dominates the rural areas of the south-west of France (notably the [[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]), an old SFIO base. These rural regions voted Socialist as a protest against Parisian [[centralism]], though they were amongst the first republican and ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9|la\u00efc]]'' regions of France.\n\nWhile the PS used to be weak in the major wealthy urban centres of the southwest, such as [[Toulouse]], the PS has made gains with middle class urban voters nationwide and is the largest party in almost all major French cities.\n\nThe PS is also strong in areas which used to be strongholds of the [[French Communist Party]]: the mining and industrial areas of the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], the left-wing rural [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]], and various industrial centres.\n\nIn recent years, thanks to urbanisation and most notably the decline of religious practice, it has made significant gains in regions such as [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] or the [[Pays de la Loire]]. For example, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal won the Breton department of [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] with 52.39%<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/053/035/5335.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}</ref> \u2013 while losing nationally \u2013 while Mitterrand has won only 38.88% in 1974 (49.19% nationwide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|title= Results on the CDSP website|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120604090721/http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|archivedate= 4 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref> This trend has also been observed in Catholic departments such as [[Loz\u00e8re]], Cantal and [[Haute-Loire]] (though the Socialists were already strong in secular logging areas).\n\nPast support in rural region [[Provence]], such as in the [[Var (department)|Var]] (formerly the \"Red Var\") has practically evaporated with the influx of wealthier residents, [[Pied-Noir]] and [[pensioner]]s.

See usage in captions and within sentences at [[Pre-Code Hollywood]] page.!--> [[horror film]] directed by [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] and starring [[Boris Karloff]] and [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]]. The picture was the first of eight films (six of which were produced by Universal) to pair the two iconic actors. It became [[Universal Pictures]]' biggest box office hit of the year, and was among the earlier movies with an almost continuous [[Film score|music score]]. Lugosi also appeared in the [[The Black Cat (1941 film)|1941 film]] with the same title.\n\nThe film helped to create and popularize the [[psychological horror]] subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre.\n\n==Plot==\nNewlyweds Peter ([[David Manners]]) and Joan Alison ([[Julie Bishop (actress)|Julie Bishop]]), on their honeymoon in Hungary, learn that due to a mixup, they must share a train compartment with Dr. Vitus Werdegast ([[B\u00e9la Lugosi]]), a Hungarian psychiatrist. Eighteen years before, Werdegast went to World War I, never seeing his wife again. He has spent the last 15 years in an infamous prison camp in Siberia. On the train, the doctor explains that he is traveling to see an old friend, Hjalmar Poelzig ([[Boris Karloff]]), an Austrian architect.\n\nLater, the doctor, Peter, and Joan, share a bus, which crashes on a desolate, rain-swept road. Joan is injured, and the doctor and Peter take her to Poelzig's home, built upon the ruins of Fort Marmorus, which Poelzig commanded during the war. Werdegast treats Joan's injury, administering the tranquilizing drug [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]], causing her to behave erratically. While Peter puts her to bed, Werdegast accuses Poelzig of betraying the fort during the war to the [[Russian Empire|Russians]], resulting in the death of thousands of [[Austro-Hungarian]] soldiers. He also accuses Poelzig of stealing his wife Karen while he was in prison. Previously, Werdegast killed Poelzig's black cat, and Poelzig explains that Werdegast has a strong fear of the animals. Poelzig carries a second black cat around the house with him while he oversees his \"collection\" of dead women on display in glass cases, including Karen.\n \nPoelzig plans to sacrifice Joan in a [[Satanism|satanic]] ritual during the dark of the moon. Poelzig had married Werdegast's wife, and when she died, he married his daughter (who was told her real father died in prison). He is seen reading a book called ''The Rites of Lucifer'' while a beautiful blonde woman ([[Lucille Lund]]) sleeps next to him. The blonde is Werdegast's daughter \u2013 thus, Poelzig's stepdaughter \u2013 also named Karen. Werdegast, who is unaware of his daughter's presence, bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike the mad architect. He also tries to persuade his foe to spare Peter and Joan, at one point literally gambling with their lives by playing a game of chess with Poelzig, which he loses.\n\nThis moment comes during the beginning of the satanists' service, when a female acolyte sees something which causes her to scream and faint. Werdegast and his servant Thamal ([[Harry Cording]]) snatch Joan from the sacrificial altar and carry her into the catacombs beneath the house, where Peter is rendered unconscious by Poelzig's servant. Joan tells Werdegast his daughter is alive in the building somewhere. He discovers that Poelzig has killed his daughter, and in an insane rage, shackles him to an embalming rack, where he proceeds to literally skin Poelzig alive. Joan tries to tear a key from the dead hand of Poelzig's servant, and Peter, regaining consciousness, mistakes Werdegast's attempt to help her as an attack and shoots him. Fatally wounded, Werdegast blows up the house, first letting the couple escape but with Poelzig's \"rotten cult\" still upstairs. \"It has been a good game,\" he says before he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Hjalmar Poelzig (billed simply as \"Karloff\")\n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as Dr. Vitus Werdegast\n* [[David Manners]] as Peter Alison\n* [[Julie Bishop (actress)|Julie Bishop]] (billed as Jacqueline Wells) as Joan Alison\n* [[Egon Brecher]] as The Majordomo\n* [[Harry Cording]] as Thamal\n* [[Lucille Lund]] as Karen Werdegast \n* [[Henry Armetta]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Albert Ritter Conti v.

See usage in captions and within sentences at [[Pre-Code Hollywood]] page.!--> [[horror film]] directed by [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] and starring [[Boris Karloff]] and [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]]. The picture was the first of eight films (six of which were produced by Universal) to pair the two iconic actors. It became [[Universal Pictures]]' biggest box office hit of the year, and was among the earlier movies with an almost continuous [[Film score|music score]]. Lugosi also appeared in the [[The Black Cat (1941 film)|1941 film]] with the same title.\n\nThe film helped to create and popularize the [[psychological horror]] subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre.\n\n==Plot==\nNewlyweds Peter ([[David Manners]]) and Joan Alison ([[Julie Bishop (actress)|Julie Bishop]]), on their honeymoon in Hungary, learn that due to a mixup, they must share a train compartment with Dr. Vitus Werdegast ([[B\u00e9la Lugosi]]), a Hungarian psychiatrist. Eighteen years before, Werdegast went to World War I, never seeing his wife again. He has spent the last 15 years in an infamous prison camp in Siberia. On the train, the doctor explains that he is traveling to see an old friend, Hjalmar Poelzig ([[Boris Karloff]]), an Austrian architect.\n\nLater, the doctor, Peter, and Joan, share a bus, which crashes on a desolate, rain-swept road. Joan is injured, and the doctor and Peter take her to Poelzig's home, built upon the ruins of Fort Marmorus, which Poelzig commanded during the war. Werdegast treats Joan's injury, administering the tranquilizing drug [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]], causing her to behave erratically. While Peter puts her to bed, Werdegast accuses Poelzig of betraying the fort during the war to the [[Russian Empire|Russians]], resulting in the death of thousands of [[Austro-Hungarian]] soldiers. He also accuses Poelzig of stealing his wife Karen while he was in prison. Previously, Werdegast killed Poelzig's black cat, and Poelzig explains that Werdegast has a strong fear of the animals. Poelzig carries a second black cat around the house with him while he oversees his \"collection\" of dead women on display in glass cases, including Karen.\n \nPoelzig plans to sacrifice Joan in a [[Satanism|satanic]] ritual during the dark of the moon. Poelzig had married Werdegast's wife, and when she died, he married his daughter (who was told her real father died in prison). He is seen reading a book called ''The Rites of Lucifer'' while a beautiful blonde woman ([[Lucille Lund]]) sleeps next to him. The blonde is Werdegast's daughter \u2013 thus, Poelzig's stepdaughter \u2013 also named Karen. Werdegast, who is unaware of his daughter's presence, bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike the mad architect. He also tries to persuade his foe to spare Peter and Joan, at one point literally gambling with their lives by playing a game of chess with Poelzig, which he loses.\n\nThis moment comes during the beginning of the satanists' service, when a female acolyte sees something which causes her to scream and faint. Werdegast and his servant Thamal ([[Harry Cording]]) snatch Joan from the sacrificial altar and carry her into the catacombs beneath the house, where Peter is rendered unconscious by Poelzig's servant. Joan tells Werdegast his daughter is alive in the building somewhere. He discovers that Poelzig has killed his daughter, and in an insane rage, shackles him to an embalming rack, where he proceeds to literally skin Poelzig alive. Joan tries to tear a key from the dead hand of Poelzig's servant, and Peter, regaining consciousness, mistakes Werdegast's attempt to help her as an attack and shoots him. Fatally wounded, Werdegast blows up the house, first letting the couple escape but with Poelzig's \"rotten cult\" still upstairs. \"It has been a good game,\" he says before he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Hjalmar Poelzig (billed simply as \"Karloff\")\n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as Dr. Vitus Werdegast\n* [[David Manners]] as Peter Alison\n* [[Julie Bishop (actress)|Julie Bishop]] (billed as Jacqueline Wells) as Joan Alison\n* [[Egon Brecher]] as The Majordomo\n* [[Harry Cording]] as Thamal\n* [[Lucille Lund]] as Karen Werdegast \n* [[Henry Armetta]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Albert Ritter Conti v.
