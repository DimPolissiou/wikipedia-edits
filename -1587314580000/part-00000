It is the first main entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] since 1999's ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''. Set within the fictional Liberty City, loosely based on [[New York City]], the game follows a criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime and corruption. The game is played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets players freely roam the three islands of Liberty City.\n\nDevelopment was shared between DMA Design, based in [[Edinburgh]], and Rockstar, based in [[New York City]]. Much of the development work involved transforming popular elements from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. It was released in October 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]], in May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence and sex. It became the [[best-selling video game]] of 2001, and has sold over 14.5 million copies since. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation of video games]], and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won a number of year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, it has received [[Porting|ports]] to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on [[mobile platforms]] in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', was released in October 2002, and two prequels, ''[[Grand Theft Auto Advance|Advance]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories|Liberty City Stories]]'', were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gta3-pc-walking.jpeg|left|thumb|Players can freely roam the game's world and have the ability to use weapons to accomplish tasks.]]\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the story progresses.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" />\n\nPlayers may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game's world.<ref name=\"IGN Cars\" /> In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.<ref name=\"GameSpot Hands-On\" /> Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}} When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour and an amount of money.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\" />\n\nIf players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"[[Fugitive|wanted]]\" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive).{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=11}} Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a [[cooldown]] mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" />\n\nThe game lets players control the [[Muteness|mute]] criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].<ref name=\"Q-A\" /> During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players complete missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight.<ref name=\"IGN Gangs\" /> While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, a paramedic service and a [[taxi cab]] service.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /><ref name=\"IGN Hood\" /> Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to [[bribe]] police after committing a crime.<ref name=\"1UP Essential\" />\n\n[[File:GTAIII PS2 Beta Drive-by.jpg|thumb|right|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' was reworked to allow players to perform [[drive-by shooting]]s by viewing sideways in a car.]]\n\nPlayers use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Micro Uzi]], an [[M16 rifle]] and a [[flamethrower]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]], [[rocket launcher]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options\u2014they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, a small-time criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] is betrayed by his girlfriend Catalina during a bank heist outside Liberty City. Left for dead, Claude is arrested, but escapes during his transfer to prison when members of the Colombian Cartel ambush his transport to abduct another prisoner. During his escape, Claude befriends bomb expert 8-Ball, who helps to introduce him to the Leone [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family for jobs. His work with the Leones ultimately earns the respect of [[Crime boss|Don]] Salvatore Leone, who requests his help personally. Discovering that the Cartel are manufacturing a new street drug that funds their operations, Salvatore instructs Claude to destroy it with 8-Ball's help.\n\nAfter the job is completed, Salvatore sends Claude out to deal with a minor problem, but his [[trophy wife]] Maria reveals it to be a trap. Claiming that Salvatore has become paranoid and a threat to him, Claude escapes with her to Staunton Island. Maria introduces Claude to the [[Yakuza]], led by Asuka Kasen and her brother Kenji, who assign him work after he cuts his ties to the Leones. During this time, Claude takes on work for corrupt LCPD detective Ray Machowski, whom he later helps to escape the city, and media mogul Donald Love, who orders a hit on Kenji under the guise of a Cartel attack, to start a gang war that will allow him to secure real estate for his businesses. Eventually, Claude encounters Catalina at a construction site during one of Love's jobs, only for her to escape.\n\nAsuka has the Yakuzas take over the site, blaming the Cartel for her brother's death, and tortures Catalina's partner Miguel, whom she left behind. Claude finds himself tasked with hitting the Cartel's operations, including their drug distribution network, earning Catalina's wrath. In retaliation, she murders Miguel and Asuka, while kidnapping Maria and ransoming her for $500,000. When Claude meets with her to hand over the ransom payment, Catalina double-crosses him, leading to him escaping the trap and killing her when she attempts to leave by helicopter. With Maria saved, she and Claude flee the scene, though as she complains about what happened to her, a gunshot rings out.{{efn|The sound of a gunshot, and the silencing of Maria's voice, has led to speculation that Claude fired the shot to kill Maria or just to silence her. Rockstar has refused to confirm this.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe core development team of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' consisted of about 23 people at [[DMA Design]] in [[Edinburgh]], who worked closely with publisher [[Rockstar Games]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> By early 2001, the team had designed the city, cars, and some weapons.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> An [[online multiplayer]] mode was initially planned for the game, but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Producer [[Leslie Benzies]] described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as a \"crime simulation game\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on 22 October 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> When porting the game to [[Microsoft Windows]], the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality, citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games.<ref name=\"PC Interview\" />\n\n=== Open world design ===\n[[File:Gta3-pc-stealing.jpeg|right|thumb|''Grand Theft Auto III'' is the first game in the series to use a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] view model, positioning the [[Virtual camera system|camera]] closer to the player character.]]\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to be the first 3D game in the series,{{sfn|Kushner|2012|pp=81\u201382}} using [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"PC Graphics\" /> When designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' games. Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The console's ability to use [[DVD]]s, an improvement over the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'s limit to [[CD]]s, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=81}} Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of [[RAM]], due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Benzies felt that creating a living city was the \"underlying principle\" of the game's concept during development.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> Executive producer [[Sam Houser]] felt that the game's 3D element allowed the \"chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time\".<ref name=\"1UP Sam\" />\n\nA major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world;<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" /> producer [[Dan Houser]] said that there was about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" /> while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000.<ref name=\"Sound Usher\" /> The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] model.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" />\n\nWhen designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which producer [[Dan Houser]] describes as \"a post industrial [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] slash [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] generic\" city.<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), basing it loosely on [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], a commercial centre resembling [[Manhattan]], and suburbs similar to [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=83}} The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], New York, and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Sam Houser cited films and shows like ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} He also cited the influence of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), describing ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /><ref name=\"Americana\">{{cite interview |title=Americana at Its Most Felonious: Q. and A.: Rockstar\u2019s Dan Houser on Grand Theft Auto V |interviewer=Chris Suellentrop |first=Dan |last=Houser |subjectlink=Dan Houser |date=9 November 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110091527/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html |archivedate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Story and characters ===\n{{Main|List of Grand Theft Auto III characters}}\nThe team developed the story and design simultaneously. \"We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story,\" said Dan Houser.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by [[Martin Scorsese]]. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with [[post-it note]]s to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" />\n\nMany of the game characters were animated using [[motion capture]], filmed at a rented studio at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] heavily inhibited this.<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> Animating [[non-player character]]s entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code,\" recalled software engineer [[Alan Campbell (writer)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions.<ref name=\"IGN Cinematic\" /> For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director [[Navid Khonsari]].<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> and his name is not officially revealed as [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] until his appearance in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004). He is a [[silent protagonist]], never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as the character will be who the players want him to be.<ref name=\"Q-A\" />\n\n=== Sound design ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity, to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the [[Mob film|gangster movie]] culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city, and provide a \"unique take on American life\";<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" /> Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /> The team used real [[Disc jockey|DJs]] to portray those on the radio. In doing so, the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, station imaging.<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" />\n\n=== Cuts and changes ===\n{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|total_width=500|image1=GTAIII LCPD copcar change.jpg|caption1=After the events of [[9/11]], the original colour scheme of the police cars in the game (top), which resembled the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], was changed to a generic black-and-white design common in the United States.|image2=GTA3 UK Cover.jpg|caption2=The original artwork for the game, which was changed after the events of 9/11.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> This artwork was still used as the cover in Europe.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/>}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=[W]e felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us ... we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us.|author=Terry Donovan, Rockstar managing director|source=IGN, 19 September 2001<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/>}}\n\nPrior to the initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during [[game development]], the changes in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' were noted to be around the time of the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay.<ref name=\"911 Delay\" /> \"Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]\", said [[Paul Eibeler]], then-president of distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=98}}\n\nOne of the changes made shortly after the September 11 attacks was the colour scheme of the [[police cars]]; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the [[New York City Police Department]]. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]].

This was met with widespread controversy.<ref name=\"Telegraph Memorable\" /> The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime, and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] of the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] stated that the game \"glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity\",<ref name=\"USAToday Glorifies\" /> and that \"the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> In response, ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for \"proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the \"adrenaline\" that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\" /> The [[National Organization for Women]] spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it \"encourages violence and the degradation of women\".<ref name=\"Morality\" /> [[Matt Richtel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the activities within the game \"crossed the line into bad taste\".<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification.

This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing \"sexual activities related to incentives and rewards\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Aus\" />\n\nOn 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede.

[[action-adventure game]] developed by [[DMA Design]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It is the first main entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] since 1999's ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''. Set within the fictional Liberty City, loosely based on [[New York City]], the game follows a criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime and corruption. The game is played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets players freely roam the three islands of Liberty City.\n\nDevelopment was shared between DMA Design, based in [[Edinburgh]], and Rockstar, based in [[New York City]]. Much of the development work involved transforming popular elements from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. It was released in October 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]], in May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence and sex. It became the [[best-selling video game]] of 2001, and has sold over 14.5 million copies since. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation of video games]], and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won a number of year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, it has received [[Porting|ports]] to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on [[mobile platforms]] in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', was released in October 2002, and two prequels, ''[[Grand Theft Auto Advance|Advance]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories|Liberty City Stories]]'', were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gta3-pc-walking.jpeg|left|thumb|Players can freely roam the game's world and have the ability to use weapons to accomplish tasks.]]\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the story progresses.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" />\n\nPlayers may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game's world.<ref name=\"IGN Cars\" /> In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.<ref name=\"GameSpot Hands-On\" /> Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}} When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour and an amount of money.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\" />\n\nIf players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"[[Fugitive|wanted]]\" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive).{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=11}} Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a [[cooldown]] mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" />\n\nThe game lets players control the [[Muteness|mute]] criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].<ref name=\"Q-A\" /> During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players complete missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight.<ref name=\"IGN Gangs\" /> While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, a paramedic service and a [[taxi cab]] service.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\" /><ref name=\"IGN Hood\" /> Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to [[bribe]] police after committing a crime.<ref name=\"1UP Essential\" />\n\n[[File:GTAIII PS2 Beta Drive-by.jpg|thumb|right|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' was reworked to allow players to perform [[drive-by shooting]]s by viewing sideways in a car.]]\n\nPlayers use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Micro Uzi]], an [[M16 rifle]] and a [[flamethrower]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]], [[rocket launcher]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.<ref name=\"IGN Review\" /> The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options\u2014they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, a small-time criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] is betrayed by his girlfriend Catalina during a bank heist outside Liberty City. Left for dead, Claude is arrested, but escapes during his transfer to prison when members of the Colombian Cartel ambush his transport to abduct another prisoner. During his escape, Claude befriends bomb expert 8-Ball, who helps to introduce him to the Leone [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family.His work with the Leones ultimately earns the respect of [[Crime boss|Don]] Salvatore Leone, who requests his help personally. Discovering that the Cartel are manufacturing a new street drug that funds their operations, Salvatore instructs Claude to destroy it with 8-Ball's help.\n\nAfter the job is completed, Salvatore sends Claude out to deal with a minor problem, but his [[trophy wife]] Maria reveals it to be a trap. Claiming that Salvatore has become paranoid and a threat to him, Claude escapes with her to Staunton Island. Maria introduces Claude to the [[Yakuza]], led by Asuka Kasen and her brother Kenji, who assign him work after he cuts his ties to the Leones. During this time, Claude takes on work for corrupt LCPD detective Ray Machowski, whom he later helps to escape the city, and media mogul Donald Love, who orders a hit on Kenji under the guise of a Cartel attack, to start a gang war that will allow him to secure real estate for his businesses. Eventually, Claude encounters Catalina at a construction site during one of Love's jobs, only for her to escape.\n\nAsuka has the Yakuzas take over the site, blaming the Cartel for her brother's death, and tortures Catalina's partner Miguel, whom she left behind. Claude finds himself tasked with hitting the Cartel's operations, including their drug distribution network, earning Catalina's wrath. In retaliation, she murders Miguel and Asuka, while kidnapping Maria and ransoming her for $500,000. When Claude meets with her to hand over the ransom payment, Catalina double-crosses him, leading to him escaping the trap and killing her when she attempts to leave by helicopter. With Maria saved, she and Claude flee the scene, though as she complains about what happened to her, a gunshot rings out.{{efn|The sound of a gunshot, and the silencing of Maria's voice, has led to speculation that Claude fired the shot to kill Maria or just to silence her. Rockstar has refused to confirm this.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe core development team of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' consisted of about 23 people at [[DMA Design]] in [[Edinburgh]], who worked closely with publisher [[Rockstar Games]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> By early 2001, the team had designed the city, cars, and some weapons.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> An [[online multiplayer]] mode was initially planned for the game, but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Producer [[Leslie Benzies]] described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as a \"crime simulation game\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The game was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on 22 October 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> When porting the game to [[Microsoft Windows]], the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality, citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games.<ref name=\"PC Interview\" />\n\n=== Open world design ===\n[[File:Gta3-pc-stealing.jpeg|right|thumb|''Grand Theft Auto III'' is the first game in the series to use a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] view model, positioning the [[Virtual camera system|camera]] closer to the player character.]]\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to be the first 3D game in the series,{{sfn|Kushner|2012|pp=81\u201382}} using [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"PC Graphics\" /> When designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' games. Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> The console's ability to use [[DVD]]s, an improvement over the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'s limit to [[CD]]s, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=81}} Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of [[RAM]], due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" /> Benzies felt that creating a living city was the \"underlying principle\" of the game's concept during development.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> Executive producer [[Sam Houser]] felt that the game's 3D element allowed the \"chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time\".<ref name=\"1UP Sam\" />\n\nA major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world;<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" /> producer [[Dan Houser]] said that there was about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" /> while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000.<ref name=\"Sound Usher\" /> The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] model.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\" />\n\nWhen designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which producer [[Dan Houser]] describes as \"a post industrial [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] slash [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] generic\" city.<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), basing it loosely on [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\" /> The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], a commercial centre resembling [[Manhattan]], and suburbs similar to [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=83}} The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], New York, and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Sam Houser cited films and shows like ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} He also cited the influence of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), describing ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /><ref name=\"Americana\">{{cite interview |title=Americana at Its Most Felonious: Q. and A.: Rockstar\u2019s Dan Houser on Grand Theft Auto V |interviewer=Chris Suellentrop |first=Dan |last=Houser |subjectlink=Dan Houser |date=9 November 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=30 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110091527/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html |archivedate=10 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Story and characters ===\n{{Main|List of Grand Theft Auto III characters}}\nThe team developed the story and design simultaneously. \"We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story,\" said Dan Houser.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\" /> The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" /> Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" /> Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by [[Martin Scorsese]]. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with [[post-it note]]s to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.<ref name=\"IGN How2\" />\n\nMany of the game characters were animated using [[motion capture]], filmed at a rented studio at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] heavily inhibited this.<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> Animating [[non-player character]]s entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code,\" recalled software engineer [[Alan Campbell (writer)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions.<ref name=\"IGN Cinematic\" /> For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director [[Navid Khonsari]].<ref name=\"IGN How3\" /> The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Characters\" /> and his name is not officially revealed as [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] until his appearance in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004). He is a [[silent protagonist]], never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as the character will be who the players want him to be.<ref name=\"Q-A\" />\n\n=== Sound design ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity, to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the [[Mob film|gangster movie]] culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city, and provide a \"unique take on American life\";<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" /> Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\" /> The team used real [[Disc jockey|DJs]] to portray those on the radio. In doing so, the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, station imaging.<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\" />\n\n=== Cuts and changes ===\n{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|total_width=500|image1=GTAIII LCPD copcar change.jpg|caption1=After the events of [[9/11]], the original colour scheme of the police cars in the game (top), which resembled the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], was changed to a generic black-and-white design common in the United States.|image2=GTA3 UK Cover.jpg|caption2=The original artwork for the game, which was changed after the events of 9/11.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> This artwork was still used as the cover in Europe.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/>}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=[W]e felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us ... we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us.|author=Terry Donovan, Rockstar managing director|source=IGN, 19 September 2001<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/>}}\n\nPrior to the initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during [[game development]], the changes in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' were noted to be around the time of the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay.<ref name=\"911 Delay\" /> \"Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]\", said [[Paul Eibeler]], then-president of distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=98}}\n\nOne of the changes made shortly after the September 11 attacks was the colour scheme of the [[police cars]]; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the [[New York City Police Department]]. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]]. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\" /> Another cut to the game is the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city's economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game's code, speculation arose that the character was related to 9/11, however Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut \"months before [release]\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\" /> There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release,<ref name=\"GameSpot Impressions\" /> although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as \"nonsense\".<ref name=\"Questions 2\" />\n\nRockstar stated that the game was \"about 1% different\" after 9/11, and that the biggest change was the cover art. They felt that the original cover, which was ultimately released as the cover in Europe, felt \"too raw\" after 9/11, and was changed into what became the \"signature style\" of the series.<ref name=\"Questions 2\" /> Sam Houser claimed that the cover was designed in an evening, and was instantly preferred over the original cover.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\" /> The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films, such as ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Questions 2\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\n=== Initial release ===\n{{Video game reviews\n| title   = PlayStation 2 version reception\n| MC      = 97/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| 1UP     = A+<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/>\n| Allgame = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n| Edge    = 8/10<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/>\n| EuroG   = 10/10<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n| GamePro = 5/5<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/>\n| GameRev = A<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n| GI      = 9.5/10<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/>\n| GSpot   = 9.6/10<ref name=\"GameSpot Review\"/>\n| GSpy    = 94/100<ref name=\"GameSpy Review\"/>\n| IGN     = 9.6/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n}}\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released to critical acclaim.

[[GameSpy]] awarded ''Grand Theft Auto III'' with Most Offensive Game of the Year, calling it \"absolutely reprehensible\".<ref name=\"GameSpy Offensive\" /> They wrote that the game rewards players for \"causing mayhem\" and \"killing innocent people by the dozen\", ultimately questioning its appropriateness within the industry.<ref name=\"GameSpy Offensive\" /> The notoriety of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' resulted in [[Wal-Mart]]'s decision to check the identification of purchasers who appeared to be under the age of 17, when purchasing mature titles.<ref name=\"IGN History2\" /> In an essay, assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of conclusion to player violence, due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration, and found that it denies the \"reality of mortality and simultaneously [forces] it on players\".{{sfn|Chess|2006|pp=80\u201390}} When speaking about the game's depiction of violence, producer Leslie Benzies claims that is intended as comedic, and that the game is \"not meant to be taken seriously\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\" /> Producer Dan Houser stated that the team was conscious of the offence that the game would attract, but \"never marketed it in a way that exploited that\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan\" />\n\nThe game allows players to participate in sexual activities with prostitutes, and murder them to reclaim the payment. This was met with widespread controversy.<ref name=\"Telegraph Memorable\" /> The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime, and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] of the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] stated that the game \"glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity\",<ref name=\"USAToday Glorifies\" /> and that \"the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> In response, ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for \"proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\" /> Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the \"adrenaline\" that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\" /> The [[National Organization for Women]] spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it \"encourages violence and the degradation of women\".<ref name=\"Morality\" /> [[Matt Richtel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the activities within the game \"crossed the line into bad taste\".<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) [[List of banned video games in Australia|banned it]], due to its depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus Ban\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive to appeal to the OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\" /> The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing \"sexual activities related to incentives and rewards\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Aus\" />\n\nOn 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede. In statements to investigators, the perpretators claimed their actions were inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto III''. In response, on 20 October 2003, the families of Hamel and Bede filed a US$246 million lawsuit against Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and [[Wal-Mart]].<ref name=\"CNN Lawsuit\" /> Rockstar and Take-Two filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in [[United States district court]] on 29 October 2003 that the \"ideas and concepts\", and the \"purported psychological effects\" of the perpetrators, are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s free-speech clause.<ref name=\"GameSpot dismiss\" /> [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], the lawyer representing the victims, denied Rockstar's claims, and attempted to move the lawsuit into a state court for consideration under Tennessee's consumer protection act.<ref name=\"GameSpot dismiss\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' has been frequently included among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]].<ref name=\"Greatest\" /> In 2007, [[GamePro]] called ''Grand Theft Auto III'' the most important video game of all time, explaining that the \"game's open-ended gameplay elements have revolutionized the way all video games are made\".<ref name=\"GamePro\" /> Similarly, IGN ranked the game among the Top 10 Most Influential Games,<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> and GameSpot listed among the greatest games of all time.<ref name=\"GameSpot Greatest\" /> In 2009, ''Game Informer'' wrote that ''Grand Theft Auto III'' \"changed the gaming landscape forever with its immersive open world sandbox\",{{sfn|Game Informer|2009|pp=44\u201379}} and in 2016 [[GamesRadar]] named it \"the most important game of the decade\".<ref name=\"GamesRadar Decade\" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it one of the greatest video games of all time in November 2012<ref name=\"Time Magazine\" /> and August 2016.<ref name=\"Time Magazine 2\" />\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to have a leading role in the popularisation of [[sandbox game]]s, inspiring those such as ''[[True Crime (series)|True Crime]]'' (2003\u201305), ''[[Saints Row]]'' (2006\u2013present) and ''[[Crackdown]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> The term \"[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' clone]]\" is frequently used to describe subsequent video games released with similar open-ended gameplay as ''Grand Theft Auto III''.<ref name=\"GTA Clone\" /> While previous video games used open world design, including earlier ''Grand Theft Auto'' games, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' took this gameplay foundation and expanded it into a 3D world,<ref name=\"GameSpot Greatest\" /> offering an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions.<ref name=\"IGN Influential\" /> Due to the greater success of the game over its predecessors, it is credited with popularising the open-world genre;<ref name=\"DMA\" /> Dan Houser felt that the game made it \"one of the most vibrant genres today\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\" />\n\nThe game also led the trend of mature video games; Dan Houser felt that it allowed other developers to create violent shooters.<ref name=\"IGN Delighted\" /> [[Hal Halpin]], president of the [[Entertainment Consumers Association]], described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as the \"lightning rod for the violence-in-games debate\".<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\" /> ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]''{{'}}s Roger Hargreaves wrote that it \"emboldened a whole new wave of games that were ... fixated with violence, gang culture\".<ref name=\"Metro Midweek\" /> Greg Ford of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' felt that the game allowed the medium to handle mature subject matter in a more serious manner than previously perceived, and noted the improvement of video game classification as a result of the game's controversy.<ref name=\"1UP Legacy\" />\n\nFollowing the game's success, Rockstar developed further titles in the series. ''Vice City'' and ''San Andreas'' are set in their titular locations in 1986 and 1992, respectively.<ref name=\"Vice City\" /><ref name=\"San Andreas\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto (Game Boy Advance)|Grand Theft Auto Advance]]'' (2004) is set in Liberty City roughly one year before the events of ''Grand Theft Auto III''.<ref name=\"Advance\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories]]'' (2005) takes place three years before the events of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' in the same rendition of Liberty City.<ref name=\"Trilogy\" /> A completely redesigned version of the city was later used in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (2008),<ref name=\"GTA IV\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' (2009),<ref name=\"Lost and Damned\" /> ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]'' (2009)<ref name=\"Ballad of Gay Tony\" /> and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars|Chinatown Wars]]'' (2009).<ref name=\"Chinatown Wars\" />\n\n=== Ports and remakes ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released on 21 May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures.<ref name=\"PC\" /> A [[GameCube]] release was planned, but later cancelled.<ref name=\"GameCube\" /> In December 2003, the game was released on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], with its sequel ''Vice City'' in a compilation titled ''Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack''. The Xbox port features custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, [[Model (computer games)|polygon models]], and reflections over the previous ports.<ref name=\"Xbox\" /> ''Double Pack'' was later bundled with ''San Andreas'' in a compilation titled ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy]]'', released in October 2005.<ref name=\"Trilogy\" /> ''The Trilogy'' was also released for [[OS X]] on 12 November 2010.<ref name=\"Mac\" /> . On 15 December 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary War Drum Studios ported the game to [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

The games focus on directing a horde of [[plant]]-like creatures called Pikmin in order to collect items by destroying obstacles, avoiding hazards and fighting [[fauna]] that are hazardous to both the player character and the Pikmin.<ref name=Pikminology/>\n\nThe series features four entries. The first two, ''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]]'', released in 2001, and ''[[Pikmin 2]]'', released in 2004, were released for the [[GameCube]] and later [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Wii]] as [[New Play Control!]] games in 2008 and 2009, while ''Pikmin 2'' was also re-released as a [[Nintendo Selects]] title in 2012. A third installment, ''[[Pikmin 3]]'', was released for the [[Wii U]] in 2013. The series' first handheld title, and most recent entry, ''[[Hey!

The ''Pikmin'' games focus on exploring an [[Earth]]-like planet named PNF-404,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://pikmin3.nintendo.com/story/|title=Official Site - Pikmin 3 for Wii U|website=pikmin3.nintendo.com|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref> and controlling a crowd of the titular Pikmin. Pikmin are intelligent, multicolored, plant-animal [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s that follow the orders of their leader. There have been multiple leaders over the course of the series, with the first and most notable being [[Captain Olimar]], a tiny [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the planet Hocotate introduced in the original ''Pikmin''. ''Pikmin 2'' features Louie and The President, Olimar's co-worker and boss, respectively, who are also playable leaders. ''Pikmin 3'' features leaders from a new alien species. The leaders are Alph, Brittany, and Charlie, who come from the planet Koppai and are similar to the Hocotatians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pikmin3.nintendo.com/story/|title=Pikmin 3 for Wii U - The Story}}</ref>\n\nPikmin are directed to perform a number of tasks, with the primary one being the retrieval of items integral to the mission of each game.<ref name=Explorer>{{cite web|url=http://pikmin3.nintendo.com/explorers-guide/|title=Pikmin for Wii U - Explorer's Guide}}</ref> The player must direct the Pikmin to overcome obstacles and PNF-404's fauna.<ref name=Pikminology/><ref name=Explorer/> Because individual Pikmin are small and weak against most [[predator]]s, and some are best suited for certain tasks, it is the responsibility of the player to direct the Pikmin appropriately in order to ensure successful retrievals of any items, avoid any hazards, and quickly tend to any obstacles and predators. Game time is divided into individual days, each of which consist of approximately 13 minutes, in which the player is encouraged to accomplish as much as possible before sunset.<ref name=Explorer/>\n\nPikmin appear in a variety of colours, which signify the Pikmin's abilities and resistance to environmental hazards. The number of Pikmin and their abilities have shifted over the course of the franchise, with the first ''Pikmin'' title featuring three colours: Red, Yellow, and Blue. Red Pikmin can resist fire, Blue Pikmin can move underwater thanks to their [[gill]]s, and Yellow Pikmin can be thrown higher than other Pikmin, and are able to carry bomb rocks.<ref name=Pikminology>{{cite web|url=http://pikmin3.nintendo.com/pikminology-101/|title=Pikmin 3 for Wii U - Pikminology}}</ref> In ''Pikmin 2'', Yellow Pikmin have lost their ability to carry bomb rocks in exchange for being immune to [[electric]]al hazards, while two new colors are introduced: White Pikmin and Purple Pikmin. White Pikmin are the fastest, resistant to poisonous gases, capable of poisoning enemies, and capable of spotting objects buried underground. In comparison, Purple Pikmin are significantly stronger and heavier than the other types, which makes them excellent at inflicting damage and carrying heavy items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pikmin3.nintendo.com/mission-mode/|title=Pikmin 3 for Wii U - Mission Mode}}</ref>\n\n''Pikmin 3'' introduced two more types: the gray-colored Rock Pikmin, and the pink-colored Winged Pikmin. Rock Pikmin can break crystalline materials, cannot be crushed or impaled, and inflict the most damage out of all Pikmin types when thrown. In comparison, Winged Pikmin can fly freely, which enables them to recover elevated items and attack airborne enemies with ease.<ref name=Pikminology/> In addition to making each type capable of carrying bomb rocks, ''Pikmin 3'' also adjusted the abilities of Yellow, Blue, White, and Purple Pikmin. Yellow Pikmin are tied with Rock Pikmin for the fastest digging speed; Blue Pikmin are capable of swimming; White Pikmin are tied with Winged Pikmin for the lowest attack strength, and slowest digging speed; Purple Pikmin are tied with Red Pikmin for second highest attack strength, and second fastest digging speed.\n\nOutside of coloration, all types of Pikmin share the same method of indicating their strength and swiftness: the [[Plant stem|stalk]] atop their heads will sport either a [[leaf]], [[bud]] or [[flower]], which develops when Pikmin are fed [[nectar]] or left planted in the ground for a certain amount of time.<ref name=Pikminology/><ref name=Explorer/> By extension, all types of Pikmin are stored in their respective motherships, referred to as \"Onions\", for safety after sunset, as they are vulnerable to [[nocturnal]] predators. The Onions play a vital role in Pikmin [[reproduction]]: when any food, such as prey or [[Compound feed|pellets]], is delivered to an Onion, it propagates [[seed]]s, which grow and are plucked from the ground as fully developed Pikmin.<ref name=Pikminology/> An Onion serves as an incubator for all Pikmin of its respective color, housing the Pikmin. The Onions travel alongside Olimar as he flies to different locations on the planet.\n\n==Games==\n\n{{Timeline of release years\n| range1       = 2001\n| range1_color = #85cd4f #cbe5b8 <!-- Based on series logo -->\n| 2001 = ''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]]''\n| 2004 = ''[[Pikmin 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''Pikmin'' (New Play Control!)\n| 2009 = ''Pikmin 2'' (New Play Control!)\n| 2013 = ''[[Pikmin 3]]''\n| 2017 = ''[[Hey!

The game's plot focuses on [[Captain Olimar]]'s predicament of having crash-landed on an unknown planet and befriending plant-animal creatures that he dubs as Pikmin. Olimar has to gather the missing pieces of his broken spaceship in order to escape, before his air supply completely runs out and he succumbs to the planet's [[oxygen]]-rich atmosphere, which is poisonous to his species.\n\n''Pikmin'' features three endings, which are dependent on the number of spaceship parts reclaimed. Reclaiming all thirty parts by the final day results in the best ending: Olimar waves goodbye to the Pikmin, who proceed to defend themselves on their own at nighttime, while Onions of various colours observe his departure off as he looks back on the unknown planet before returning home. Reclaiming at least the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the normal ending: Olimar quickly departs, while one of each type of Pikmin run toward his ship to watch him depart. Lastly, failing to reclaim the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the worst ending: Olimar crash-lands back onto the planet, succumbs to oxygen poisoning, and is taken by a number of Pikmin to be placed into an Onion, which converts him into a Pikmin-Hocotatian hybrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/pikmin/Endings|title=Endings - Pikmin Wiki Guide - IGN}}</ref>\n\n''Pikmin'' was ported to the [[Wii]] in 2009 as a [[New Play Control!]] title, which was made available on the [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in North America in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pikmin-wii-u|title=Pikmin for Wii U}}</ref>\n\n===''Pikmin 2'' (2004)===\n{{main|Pikmin 2}}\n''Pikmin 2'', released in 2004, takes place immediately following the events of ''Pikmin''. When Olimar returns to his home planet Hocotate, he discovers that his employer, Hocotate Freight, has gone into severe debt. When the company's president discovers that the souvenir that Olimar has brought back with him is significantly valuable, he orders Olimar and Louie, another employee, to journey back to the Pikmin planet and gather treasure to pay off the debt.\n\nThe main objective of ''Pikmin 2'' is to collect human waste that is referred to as treasure on Hocotate, including bottle caps and gadgets. The player controls both Olimar and Louie, alternating between the two characters in order to divide and accomplish more tasks during a single day.

Dolphin, a reference to the [[GameCube]]'s developmental code name. He has a wife, son and daughter. ''Pikmin 2'' introduces Louie, a co-worker of Olimar, who places the Hocotate Freight Company in debt after losing a shipment of gold pikpik carrots to a \"ravenous space bunny\". The names \"Olimar\" and \"Louie\" are based on [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who were also created by Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\nAnother main character in ''Pikmin 2'' is the President of Hocotate Freight, a large man that runs the company and keeps debt collectors away. The president is forced to sell the Dolphin, and it is replaced by an unnamed ship that is able to speak, name and value the treasure on the planet.\n\nIn ''Pikmin 3'', three new characters succeed Olimar as playable leaders: Alph the engineer, Brittany the botanist, and Captain Charlie.<ref name=\":0\" /> All three characters come from Koppai, a planet whose inhabitants are similar to the Hocotations, and they interact with each other through in-game dialogue. While not playable during the game's story, Olimar and Louie both appear later in the game's story and become integral to its plot, while Olimar's expedition logs are later discovered by the crew and offer helpful advice regarding PNF-404.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-08-miyamoto-reveals-pikmin-3-secret-memos|title=Miyamoto reveals the secret behind Pikmin 3's hidden memos}}</ref>\n\nAfter becoming stranded on the unknown planet in ''Pikmin'', Olimar becomes acquainted with the species of plant-like beings that he names \"Pikmin\" because they resemble the \"Pikpik\" brand of carrots on his home planet of Hocotate. They are small, brightly colored creatures who are each as tall as an [[Dime (United States coin)|US dime]]. They follow any command: from attacking enemies and defending Olimar to retrieving large artifacts. Pikmin are generally very weak, unless they are used in hordes, as the Pikmin are excellent at working together. Pikmin speak with strange, squeaking noises. Simple commands can, however, be communicated to them by the use of a whistle or any other device capable of producing high-pitched noises.\n\n[[File:Pikmin species.jpg|thumb|All Pikmin species, excluding Bulbmin. From left to right: Red Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, Blue Pikmin, Purple Pikmin, White Pikmin, Rock Pikmin, and Winged Pikmin]]\n\nPikmin come in several colors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In ''Pikmin'', there are three types of Pikmin: Red Pikmin, who are better in combat and can withstand extreme heat and fire; Yellow Pikmin, who can be thrown higher, can use bomb rocks (''Pikmin'' only), are immune to electricity (''Pikmin 2'', ''Pikmin 3'', and ''Hey! Pikmin''), and can dig faster (''Pikmin 3'' only); and Blue Pikmin, which have gills and can walk/swim in water (or get splashed with water-based attacks) without drowning.<ref name=Pikminology/> \n\nIn ''Pikmin 2'', two new species of Pikmin were introduced: Purple and White Pikmin. Purple Pikmin move slower than normal Pikmin, but have ten times the strength and weight of other Pikmin, giving them the ability to pick up much heavier objects and attack and destroy obstacles and other enemies with fewer numbers. They also sometimes stun enemies when they land near or on them.<ref name=Pikminology/> White Pikmin, who, when ingested by enemies, damage the enemy through being toxic. White Pikmin themselves are immune to poison, can locate buried treasure with their special eyes, and can run faster than other Pikmin.<ref name=Pikminology/> Also introduced is a kind of parasitic Pikmin/Bulborb hybrid called Bulbmin, Bulborbs that have been infected by parasitic Pikmin, that follow Olimar after their leader is killed. They are immune to all hazards (save explosions, being eaten, being crushed, and pits), and will not leave the caves in which they are found with Olimar. The only way to \"keep\" them is if they are transformed into other Pikmin species with Candypop Buds.\n\n''Pikmin 3'' introduced two new species of Pikmin. The gray-colored Rock Pikmin look like small rocks and can smash through glass, crystals, ice, and the carapaces of large creatures. These Pikmin can also survive crushing attacks from boulders and enemies. Rock Pikmin also cause more initial damage when thrown at an enemy, though they are unable to latch onto them.<ref name=Pikminology/> The second species introduced in this game are the pink-colored Winged Pikmin. These Pikmin are the tiniest species of Pikmin and hover using wings in the air. They can fly over hazards such as water and pits, and can carry items in the air.<ref name=Pikminology/>.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand-section|date=February 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Aggregate review scores'''\n!Game\n![[GameRankings]]\n![[Metacritic]]\n|-\n|''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]]''\n|<center> (GCN) 87%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/516498-pikmin/index.html |title=Pikmin for GameCube |publisher=GameRankings |date=2001-12-02 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}</ref></center>\n<center> (Wii) 79%<ref name=\"gamerankings1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/954380-new-play-control-pikmin/index.html |title=New Play Control!

Brawl]]'', and its sequels, [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']], and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. He commands the Pikmin in battle and, like in the ''Pikmin'' series, he is almost entirely dependent on them. Olimar is able to pluck new Pikmin from the ground at any time unless he has the maximum number of Pikmin allowed; he can command up to six in ''Brawl'', and three in ''3DS'' and ''Wii U''. The Pikmin, as in the ''Pikmin'' series, are fragile and can be defeated easily, but new ones can be plucked from the stage immediately after. Olimar's Final Smash, a signature one-use technique, shows him getting into his Hocotate Spaceship and flying off into the sky, while Red Bulborbs damage the other players on the ground. The ship then plummets to the ground and causes an explosion, dealing damage and knockback to opposing players as Olimar is ejected from it. ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' also features a playable stage called Distant Planet, based on the general setting of the Pikmin's home planet featured in the first three ''Pikmin'' titles. The same stage returns in the 3DS version, while the [[Wii U]] version has a new Pikmin stage called Garden of Hope, which is based on the area of the same name in ''[[Pikmin 3]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Sakurai |first=Masahiro |authorlink=Masahiro Sakurai | date= January 9, 2008| title=Pikmin & Olimar | publisher=Nintendo | url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/pikmin.html | accessdate=January 9, 2008}}</ref> Alph from ''Pikmin 3'' appears as an alternate costume for Olimar.\n\nIn the [[Nintendo 3DS]] built-in application ''[[Nintendo 3DS#Augmented reality|AR Games]]'', a Red, Yellow, and Blue Pikmin appear on an AR card. Pikmin also make a cameo during the process of transferring downloadable content from a [[Nintendo DSi]] to a 3DS, (Or transferring from a 3DS to another 3DS or 2DS) with various types of Pikmin carrying the data over. A similar animation occurs when transferring save data and other information from a Wii to an SD card using the [[Wii U]] Transfer application, and a second animation, picking up where the first one leaves off, appears when completing the transfer from the SD card to a [[Wii U]].\n\n''[[Nintendo Land]]'' includes the series in a team attraction titled ''Pikmin Adventure'', where players' Miis fight robotic versions of familiar Pikmin foes. ''Pikmin Adventure'' utilizes the [[Wii U Gamepad]] and [[Wii Remote]]; the former controls Olimar, whereas the latter allows other players to play as Pikmin.\n\nOn the [[Game Boy Advance]], the card-based [[Nintendo e-Reader]] peripheral included Pikmin minigames exclusive to Japan following the release of [[Pikmin 2]], titled ''Pikmin 2-e''. In the various minigames, players control either Olimar or the Pikmin to complete various puzzles.\n\n===Appearances in other media===\nOn November 5, 2014, three short animated ''Pikmin'' films were released on the [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] eShop, after being shown at the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]]. The short films, \"The Night Juicer\", \"Treasure in a Bottle\", and \"Occupational Hazards\", each feature Captain Olimar and groups of Pikmin.

Pikmin are intelligent, multicolored, plant-animal [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s that follow the orders of their leader. There have been multiple leaders over the course of the series, with the first and most notable being [[Captain Olimar]], a tiny [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the planet Hocotate introduced in the original ''Pikmin''. ''Pikmin 2'' features Louie and The President, Olimar's co-worker and boss, respectively, who are also playable leaders. ''Pikmin 3'' features leaders from a new alien species.

In comparison, Purple Pikmin are significantly stronger and heavier than the other types, which makes them excellent at inflicting damage and carrying heavy items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pikmin3.nintendo.com/mission-mode/|title=Pikmin 3 for Wii U - Mission Mode}}</ref>\n\n''Pikmin 3'' introduced two more types: the gray-colored Rock Pikmin, and the pink-colored Winged Pikmin. Rock Pikmin can break crystalline materials, cannot be crushed or impaled, and inflict the most damage out of all Pikmin types when thrown. In comparison, Winged Pikmin can fly freely, which enables them to recover elevated items and attack airborne enemies with ease.<ref name=Pikminology/> In addition to making each type capable of carrying bomb rocks, ''Pikmin 3'' also adjusted the abilities of Yellow, Blue, White, and Purple Pikmin. Yellow Pikmin are tied with Rock Pikmin for the fastest digging speed; Blue Pikmin are capable of swimming; White Pikmin are tied with Winged Pikmin for the lowest attack strength, and slowest digging speed; Purple Pikmin are tied with Red Pikmin for second highest attack strength, and second fastest digging speed.\n\nOutside of coloration, all types of Pikmin share the same method of indicating their strength and swiftness: the [[Plant stem|stalk]] atop their heads will sport either a [[leaf]], [[bud]] or [[flower]], which develops when Pikmin are fed [[nectar]] or left planted in the ground for a certain amount of time.<ref name=Pikminology/><ref name=Explorer/> By extension, all types of Pikmin are stored in their respective motherships, referred to as \"Onions\", for safety after sunset, as they are vulnerable to [[nocturnal]] predators. The Onions play a vital role in Pikmin [[reproduction]]: when any food, such as prey or [[Compound feed|pellets]], is delivered to an Onion, it propagates [[seed]]s, which grow and are plucked from the ground as fully developed Pikmin.<ref name=Pikminology/> An Onion serves as an incubator for all Pikmin of its respective color, housing the Pikmin. The Onions travel alongside Olimar as he flies to different locations on the planet.\n\n==Games==\n\n{{Timeline of release years\n| range1       = 2001\n| range1_color = #85cd4f #cbe5b8 <!-- Based on series logo -->\n| 2001 = ''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]]''\n| 2004 = ''[[Pikmin 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''Pikmin'' (New Play Control!)\n| 2009 = ''Pikmin 2'' (New Play Control!)\n| 2013 = ''[[Pikmin 3]]''\n| 2017 = ''[[Hey!

The game's plot focuses on [[Captain Olimar]]'s predicament of having crash-landed on an unknown planet and befriending plant-animal creatures that he dubs as Pikmin. Olimar has to gather the missing pieces of his broken spaceship in order to escape, before his air supply completely runs out and he succumbs to the planet's [[oxygen]]-rich atmosphere, which is poisonous to his species.\n\n''Pikmin'' features three endings, which are dependent on the number of spaceship parts reclaimed. Reclaiming all thirty parts by the final day results in the best ending: Olimar waves goodbye to the Pikmin, who proceed to defend themselves on their own at nighttime, while Onions of various colours observe his departure off as he looks back on the unknown planet before returning home. Reclaiming at least the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the normal ending: Olimar quickly departs, while one of each type of Pikmin run toward his ship to watch him depart. Lastly, failing to reclaim the twenty-five required parts by the final day results in the worst ending: Olimar crash-lands back onto the planet, succumbs to oxygen poisoning, and is taken by a number of Pikmin to be placed into an Onion, which converts him into a Pikmin-Hocotatian hybrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/pikmin/Endings|title=Endings - Pikmin Wiki Guide - IGN}}</ref>\n\n''Pikmin'' was ported to the [[Wii]] in 2009 as a [[New Play Control!]] title, which was made available on the [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in North America in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pikmin-wii-u|title=Pikmin for Wii U}}</ref>\n\n===''Pikmin 2'' (2004)===\n{{main|Pikmin 2}}\n''Pikmin 2'', released in 2004, takes place immediately following the events of ''Pikmin''. When Olimar returns to his home planet Hocotate, he discovers that his employer, Hocotate Freight, has gone into severe debt. When the company's president discovers that the souvenir that Olimar has brought back with him is significantly valuable, he orders Olimar and Louie, another employee, to journey back to the Pikmin planet and gather treasure to pay off the debt.\n\nThe main objective of ''Pikmin 2'' is to collect human waste that is referred to as treasure on Hocotate, including bottle caps and gadgets. The player controls both Olimar and Louie, alternating between the two characters in order to divide and accomplish more tasks during a single day. Unlike the first game, ''Pikmin 2'' has no deadline, so the player can spend as many days as desired to collect all the treasure.\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Pikmin 2'' was ported to the Wii in 2009 as a New Play Control! title, which was made available on the Wii U's Virtual Console service in Europe in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/09/new_play_control_pikmin_out_now_on_the_wii_u_eshop_in_europe|title=New Play Control!

Dolphin, a reference to the [[GameCube]]'s developmental code name. He has a wife, son and daughter. ''Pikmin 2'' introduces Louie, a co-worker of Olimar, who places the Hocotate Freight Company in debt after losing a shipment of gold pikpik carrots to a \"ravenous space bunny\". The names \"Olimar\" and \"Louie\" are based on [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who were also created by Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\nAnother main character in ''Pikmin 2'' is the President of Hocotate Freight, a large man that runs the company and keeps debt collectors away. The president is forced to sell the Dolphin, and it is replaced by an unnamed ship that is able to speak, name and value the treasure on the planet.\n\nIn ''Pikmin 3'', three new characters succeed Olimar as playable leaders: Alph the engineer, Brittany the botanist, and Captain Charlie.<ref name=\":0\" /> All three characters come from Koppai, a planet whose inhabitants are similar to the Hocotations, and they interact with each other through in-game dialogue. While not playable during the game's story, Olimar and Louie both appear later in the game's story and become integral to its plot, while Olimar's expedition logs are later discovered by the crew and offer helpful advice regarding PNF-404.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-08-miyamoto-reveals-pikmin-3-secret-memos|title=Miyamoto reveals the secret behind Pikmin 3's hidden memos}}</ref>\n\nAfter becoming stranded on the unknown planet in ''Pikmin'', Olimar becomes acquainted with the species of plant-like beings that he names \"Pikmin\" because they resemble the \"Pikpik\" brand of carrots on his home planet of Hocotate. They are small, brightly colored creatures who are each as tall as an [[Dime (United States coin)|US dime]]. They follow any command: from attacking enemies and defending Olimar to retrieving large artifacts. Pikmin are generally very weak, unless they are used in hordes, as the Pikmin are excellent at working together. Pikmin speak with strange, squeaking noises. Simple commands can, however, be communicated to them by the use of a whistle or any other device capable of producing high-pitched noises.\n\n[[File:Pikmin species.jpg|thumb|All Pikmin species, excluding Bulbmin. From left to right: Red Pikmin, Yellow Pikmin, Blue Pikmin, Purple Pikmin, White Pikmin, Rock Pikmin, and Winged Pikmin]]\n\nPikmin come in several colors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In ''Pikmin'', there are three types of Pikmin: Red Pikmin, who are better in combat and can withstand extreme heat and fire; Yellow Pikmin, who can be thrown higher, can use bomb rocks (''Pikmin'' only), are immune to electricity (''Pikmin 2'', ''Pikmin 3'', and ''Hey! Pikmin''), and can dig faster (''Pikmin 3'' only); and Blue Pikmin, which have gills and can walk/swim in water (or get splashed with water-based attacks) without drowning.<ref name=Pikminology/> \n\nIn ''Pikmin 2'', two new species of Pikmin were introduced: Purple and White Pikmin. Purple Pikmin move slower than normal Pikmin, but have ten times the strength and weight of other Pikmin, giving them the ability to pick up much heavier objects and attack and destroy obstacles and other enemies with fewer numbers. They also sometimes stun enemies when they land near or on them.<ref name=Pikminology/> White Pikmin, who, when ingested by enemies, damage the enemy through being toxic. White Pikmin themselves are immune to poison, can locate buried treasure with their special eyes, and can run faster than other Pikmin.<ref name=Pikminology/> Also introduced is a kind of parasitic Pikmin/Bulborb hybrid called Bulbmin, Bulborbs that have been infected by parasitic Pikmin, that follow Olimar after their leader is killed. They are immune to all hazards (save explosions, being eaten, being crushed, and pits), and will not leave the caves in which they are found with Olimar. The only way to \"keep\" them is if they are transformed into other Pikmin species with Candypop Buds.\n\n''Pikmin 3'' introduced two new species of Pikmin. The gray-colored Rock Pikmin look like small rocks and can smash through glass, crystals, ice, and the carapaces of large creatures. These Pikmin can also survive crushing attacks from boulders and enemies. Rock Pikmin also cause more initial damage when thrown at an enemy, though they are unable to latch onto them.<ref name=Pikminology/> The second species introduced in this game are the pink-colored Winged Pikmin. These Pikmin are the tiniest species of Pikmin and hover using wings in the air. They can fly over hazards such as water and pits, and can carry items in the air.<ref name=Pikminology/>.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand-section|date=February 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Aggregate review scores'''\n!Game\n![[GameRankings]]\n![[Metacritic]]\n|-\n|''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]]''\n|<center> (GCN) 87%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/516498-pikmin/index.html |title=Pikmin for GameCube |publisher=GameRankings |date=2001-12-02 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}</ref></center>\n<center> (Wii) 79%<ref name=\"gamerankings1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/954380-new-play-control-pikmin/index.html |title=New Play Control!

Brawl]]'', and its sequels, [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']], and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. He commands the Pikmin in battle and, like in the ''Pikmin'' series, he is almost entirely dependent on them. Olimar is able to pluck new Pikmin from the ground at any time unless he has the maximum number of Pikmin allowed; he can command up to six in ''Brawl'', and three in ''3DS'' and ''Wii U''. The Pikmin, as in the ''Pikmin'' series, are fragile and can be defeated easily, but new ones can be plucked from the stage immediately after. Olimar's Final Smash, a signature one-use technique, shows him getting into his Hocotate Spaceship and flying off into the sky, while Red Bulborbs damage the other players on the ground. The ship then plummets to the ground and causes an explosion, dealing damage and knockback to opposing players as Olimar is ejected from it. ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' also features a playable stage called Distant Planet, based on the general setting of the Pikmin's home planet featured in the first three ''Pikmin'' titles. The same stage returns in the 3DS version, while the [[Wii U]] version has a new Pikmin stage called Garden of Hope, which is based on the area of the same name in ''[[Pikmin 3]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Sakurai |first=Masahiro |authorlink=Masahiro Sakurai | date= January 9, 2008| title=Pikmin & Olimar | publisher=Nintendo | url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/pikmin.html | accessdate=January 9, 2008}}</ref> Alph from ''Pikmin 3'' appears as an alternate costume for Olimar.\n\nIn the [[Nintendo 3DS]] built-in application ''[[Nintendo 3DS#Augmented reality|AR Games]]'', a Red, Yellow, and Blue Pikmin appear on an AR card. Pikmin also make a cameo during the process of transferring downloadable content from a [[Nintendo DSi]] to a 3DS, (Or transferring from a 3DS to another 3DS or 2DS) with various types of Pikmin carrying the data over. A similar animation occurs when transferring save data and other information from a Wii to an SD card using the [[Wii U]] Transfer application, and a second animation, picking up where the first one leaves off, appears when completing the transfer from the SD card to a [[Wii U]].\n\n''[[Nintendo Land]]'' includes the series in a team attraction titled ''Pikmin Adventure'', where players' Miis fight robotic versions of familiar Pikmin foes. ''Pikmin Adventure'' utilizes the [[Wii U Gamepad]] and [[Wii Remote]]; the former controls Olimar, whereas the latter allows other players to play as Pikmin.\n\nOn the [[Game Boy Advance]], the card-based [[Nintendo e-Reader]] peripheral included Pikmin minigames exclusive to Japan following the release of [[Pikmin 2]], titled ''Pikmin 2-e''. In the various minigames, players control either Olimar or the Pikmin to complete various puzzles.\n\n===Appearances in other media===\nOn November 5, 2014, three short animated ''Pikmin'' films were released on the [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] eShop, after being shown at the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]].

Because there are only seven GRKs (only 4 of which are widely expressed throughout the body) but over 800 human GPCRs, GRKs appear to have limited phosphorylation site selectivity and are regulated primarily by the GPCR active state.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/>\n\nG protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate activated G protein-coupled receptors, which promotes the binding of an [[arrestin]] protein to the receptor. Phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in GPCRs act as [[binding site]]s for and activators of arrestin proteins. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor prevents receptor stimulation of [[heterotrimeric G protein]] transducer proteins, blocking their cellular signaling and resulting in receptor [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]]. Arrestin binding also directs receptors to specific cellular [[Endocytosis|internalization pathways]], removing the receptors from the cell surface and also preventing additional activation. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor also enables receptor signaling through arrestin partner proteins. Thus the GRK/arrestin system serves as a complex signaling switch for G protein-coupled receptors.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/>\n\nGRKs can be regulated by signaling events in cells, both in direct feedback mechanisms where receptor signals alter GRK activity over time, and due to signals emanating from distinct pathways from a particular GPCR/GRK system of interest. For example, GRK1 is regulated by the calcium sensor protein recoverin: calcium-bound recoverin binds directly to GRK1 to inhibit its ability to phosphorylate and desensitize rhodopsin, the visual GPCR in the retina, in light-activated retinal rod cells since light activation raises intracellular calcium in these cells, whereas in dark-adapted eyes, calcium levels are low in rod cells and GRK1 is not inhibited by recoverin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CK, Inglese J, Lefkowitz RJ, Hurley JB | title = Ca(2+)-dependent interaction of recoverin with rhodopsin kinase | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 30 | pages = 18060\u20136 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7629115 | doi=10.1074/jbc.270.30.18060| doi-access = free }}</ref> The non-visual GRKs are inhibited instead by the calcium-binding protein [[calmodulin]].<ref name=\"renamed_from_17084806_on_20190924004932\"/> GRK2 and GRK3 share a carboxyl terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to G protein beta/gamma subunits, and GPCR activation of heterotrimeric G proteins releases this free beta/gamma complex that binds to GRK2/3 to recruit these kinases to the cell membrane precisely at the location of the activated receptor, augmenting GRK activity to regulate the activated receptor.<ref name=\"renamed_from_17084806_on_20190924004932\"/><ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/> GRK2 activity can be modulated by its phosphorylation by protein kinase A or protein kinase C, and by post-translational modification of cysteines by S-nitrosylation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Willets JM, Challiss RA, Nahorski SR |title=Non-visual GRKs: are we seeing the whole picture? |journal= Trends Pharmacol Sci |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=626\u2013633 |year=2003 |pmid=14654303 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2003.10.003 |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~xzhuang/PDF/GRKs.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Whalen EJ, Foster MW, Matsumoto A, Ozawa K, Violin JD, Que LG, Nelson CD, Benhar M, Keys JR, Rockman HA, Koch WJ, Daaka Y, Lefkowitz RJ, Stamler JS |title=Regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling by S-nitrosylation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 |journal= Cell |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=511\u2013522 |year=2007 |pmid=17482545 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.046 }}</ref>\n\n== GRK Structures ==\n\nX-ray crystal structures have been obtained for several GRKs (GRK1, GRK2, GRK4, GRK5 and GRK6), alone or bound to ligands.<ref name=\"renamed_from_24984143_on_20190924004932\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Homan KT, Tesmer JJ |title=Molecular basis for small molecule inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor kinases |journal=ACS Chem Biol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=246\u2013256 |year=2015 |pmid=24984143 |doi=10.1021/cb5003976 |pmc=4301174 }}</ref> Overall, GRKs share sequence homology and domain organization in which the central protein kinase catalytic domain is preceded by a domain with homology to the active domain of [[Regulator of G protein signaling|Regulator of G protein Signaling proteins]], RGS proteins (the RGS-homology \u2013 RH \u2013 domain) and is followed by a variable carboxyl terminal tail regulatory region.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/> In the folded proteins, the kinase domain forms a typical bi-lobe kinase structure with a central ATP-binding active site.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/> The RH domain is composed of alpha-helical region formed from the amino terminal sequence plus a short stretch of sequence following the kinase domain that provides 2 additional helices, and makes extensive contacts with one side of the kinase domain.<ref name=\"renamed_from_24984143_on_20190924004932\"/> Modeling and mutagenesis suggests that the RH domain senses GPCR activation to open the kinase active site.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= He Y, Gao X, Goswami D, Hou L, Pal K, Yin Y, Zhao G, Ernst OP, Griffin P, Melcher K, Xu HE |title=Molecular assembly of rhodopsin with G protein-coupled receptor kinases |journal=Cell Res |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=728\u2013747 |year=2017 |pmid=28524165 |pmc=5518878 |doi=10.1038/cr.2017.72 }}</ref>\n\n== GRK Physiological Functions ==\n\nGRK1 is involved with rhodopsin phosphorylation and deactivation in vision, together with [[SAG (gene)|arrestin-1]], also known as S-antigen.

Because there are only seven GRKs (only 4 of which are widely expressed throughout the body) but over 800 human GPCRs, GRKs appear to have limited phosphorylation site selectivity and are regulated primarily by the GPCR active state.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/>\n\nG protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate activated G protein-coupled receptors, which promotes the binding of an [[arrestin]] protein to the receptor. Phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in GPCRs act as [[binding site]]s for and activators of arrestin proteins. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor prevents receptor stimulation of [[heterotrimeric G protein]] transducer proteins, blocking their cellular signaling and resulting in receptor [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]]. Arrestin binding also directs receptors to specific cellular [[Endocytosis|internalization pathways]], removing the receptors from the cell surface and also preventing additional activation. Arrestin binding to phosphorylated, active receptor also enables receptor signaling through arrestin partner proteins. Thus the GRK/arrestin system serves as a complex signaling switch for G protein-coupled receptors.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/>\n\nGRKs can be regulated by signaling events in cells, both in direct feedback mechanisms where receptor signals alter GRK activity over time, and due to signals emanating from distinct pathways from a particular GPCR/GRK system of interest. For example, GRK1 is regulated by the calcium sensor protein recoverin: calcium-bound recoverin binds directly to GRK1 to inhibit its ability to phosphorylate and desensitize rhodopsin, the visual GPCR in the retina, in light-activated retinal rod cells since light activation raises intracellular calcium in these cells, whereas in dark-adapted eyes, calcium levels are low in rod cells and GRK1 is not inhibited by recoverin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CK, Inglese J, Lefkowitz RJ, Hurley JB | title = Ca(2+)-dependent interaction of recoverin with rhodopsin kinase | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 30 | pages = 18060\u20136 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7629115 | doi=10.1074/jbc.270.30.18060| doi-access = free }}</ref> The non-visual GRKs are inhibited instead by the calcium-binding protein [[calmodulin]].<ref name=\"renamed_from_17084806_on_20190924004932\"/> GRK2 and GRK3 share a carboxyl terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds to G protein beta/gamma subunits, and GPCR activation of heterotrimeric G proteins releases this free beta/gamma complex that binds to GRK2/3 to recruit these kinases to the cell membrane precisely at the location of the activated receptor, augmenting GRK activity to regulate the activated receptor.<ref name=\"renamed_from_17084806_on_20190924004932\"/><ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/> GRK2 activity can be modulated by its phosphorylation by protein kinase A or protein kinase C, and by post-translational modification of cysteines by S-nitrosylation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Willets JM, Challiss RA, Nahorski SR |title=Non-visual GRKs: are we seeing the whole picture? |journal= Trends Pharmacol Sci |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=626\u2013633 |year=2003 |pmid=14654303 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2003.10.003 |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~xzhuang/PDF/GRKs.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Whalen EJ, Foster MW, Matsumoto A, Ozawa K, Violin JD, Que LG, Nelson CD, Benhar M, Keys JR, Rockman HA, Koch WJ, Daaka Y, Lefkowitz RJ, Stamler JS |title=Regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling by S-nitrosylation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 |journal= Cell |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=511\u2013522 |year=2007 |pmid=17482545 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.046 }}</ref>\n\n== GRK Structures ==\n\nX-ray crystal structures have been obtained for several GRKs (GRK1, GRK2, GRK4, GRK5 and GRK6), alone or bound to ligands.<ref name=\"renamed_from_24984143_on_20190924004932\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Homan KT, Tesmer JJ |title=Molecular basis for small molecule inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor kinases |journal=ACS Chem Biol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=246\u2013256 |year=2015 |pmid=24984143 |doi=10.1021/cb5003976 |pmc=4301174 }}</ref> Overall, GRKs share sequence homology and domain organization in which the central protein kinase catalytic domain is preceded by a domain with homology to the active domain of [[Regulator of G protein signaling|Regulator of G protein Signaling proteins]], RGS proteins (the RGS-homology \u2013 RH \u2013 domain) and is followed by a variable carboxyl terminal tail regulatory region.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/> In the folded proteins, the kinase domain forms a typical bi-lobe kinase structure with a central ATP-binding active site.<ref name=\"renamed_from_30837883_on_20190924004932\"/> The RH domain is composed of alpha-helical region formed from the amino terminal sequence plus a short stretch of sequence following the kinase domain that provides 2 additional helices, and makes extensive contacts with one side of the kinase domain.<ref name=\"renamed_from_24984143_on_20190924004932\"/> Modeling and mutagenesis suggests that the RH domain senses GPCR activation to open the kinase active site.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= He Y, Gao X, Goswami D, Hou L, Pal K, Yin Y, Zhao G, Ernst OP, Griffin P, Melcher K, Xu HE |title=Molecular assembly of rhodopsin with G protein-coupled receptor kinases |journal=Cell Res |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=728\u2013747 |year=2017 |pmid=28524165 |pmc=5518878 |doi=10.1038/cr.2017.72 }}</ref>\n\n== GRK Physiological Functions ==\n\nGRK1 is involved with rhodopsin phosphorylation and deactivation in vision, together with [[SAG (gene)|arrestin-1]], also known as S-antigen.

This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> itself, but rather the result of applying some operator <math>M</math> onto x, <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\nFirst, the algorithm represents the vector <math>\\overrightarrow{b}</math> as a [[quantum state]] of the form:\n: <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N b_i|i\\rangle.</math>\n\nNext, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator <math>e^{iAt}</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> for a superposition of different times <math>t</math>. The ability to decompose <math>|b\\rangle</math> into the eigenbasis of <math>A</math> and to find the corresponding eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_j</math> is facilitated by the use of [[quantum phase estimation]].\n\nThe state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle|\\lambda_j\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>u_j</math> is the eigenvector basis of <math>A</math>, and <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle</math>.\n\nWe would then like to perform the linear map taking <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> to <math>C\\lambda^{-1}_j|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math>, where <math>C</math> is a normalizing constant. The linear mapping operation is not unitary and thus will require a number of repetitions as it has some probability of failing. After it succeeds, we uncompute the <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> register and are left with a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i\\lambda^{-1}_j|u_j\\rangle=A^{-1}|b\\rangle=|x\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|x\\rangle</math> is a quantum-mechanical representation of the desired solution vector&nbsp;''x''. To read out all components of ''x'' would require the procedure be repeated at least ''N'' times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in <math>x</math> itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator ''M'' acting on&nbsp;''x''. By mapping ''M'' to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to ''M'', we obtain an estimate of the expectation value <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector ''x'' to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector&nbsp;''x''.\n\n== Explanation of the algorithm ==\n\n=== Initialization ===\nFirstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix <math>A</math> be [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] so that it can be converted into a [[unitary operator]]. In the case where <math>A</math> is not Hermitian, define \n:<math>\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & A \\\\\n     A^t & 0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nAs <math>C</math> is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve <math>Cy=\\begin{bmatrix}\n     b \\\\\n     0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math> to obtain <math>y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 \\\\\n     x  \n  \\end{bmatrix} </math>.\n\nSecondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare <math>|b\\rangle</math>, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator <math>B</math> that can take some arbitrary quantum state <math>|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given <math>|b\\rangle</math> as input. Any error in the preparation of state <math>|b\\rangle</math> is ignored.\n\nFinally, the algorithm assumes that the state <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> can be prepared efficiently. Where\n\n: <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle := \\sqrt{2/T} \\sum_{\\tau \\mathop =0}^{T-1} \\sin\\pi\\left(\\tfrac{\\tau+\\tfrac{1}{2}}{T}\\right) |\\tau\\rangle</math>\n\nfor some large <math>T</math>. The coefficients of <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine described below.\n\n=== Hamiltonian simulation ===\n[[Hamiltonian simulation]] is used to transform the Hermitian matrix <math>A</math> into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most ''s'' nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time&nbsp;O(''s''). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows <math>e^{iAt}</math> to be simulated in time <math>O(\\log(N)s^2t)</math>.\n\n=== <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine ===\nThe key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math>, is defined as follows and incorporates a [[phase estimation]] subroutine:\n\n1. Prepare <math>|\\psi_0\\rangle^C</math> on register ''C''\n\n2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)\n\n3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register&nbsp;''C''. Denote the resulting basis states with <math>|k\\rangle</math> for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''T''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. Define <math>\\lambda_k:=2\\pi k/t_0</math>.\n\n4. Adjoin a three-dimensional register ''S'' in the state\n: <math>|h(\\lambda_k)\\rangle^S := \\sqrt{1-f(\\lambda_k)^2 - g(\\lambda_k)^2} |\\mathrm{nothing} \\rangle^S + f(\\lambda_k)| \\mathrm{well} \\rangle^S+g (\\lambda_k) | \\mathrm{ill} \\rangle^S, </math>\n\n5. Reverse steps 1\u20133, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.\n\nThe phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of ''A'' up to error <math>\\epsilon</math>.\n\nThe ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of ''A''.  In this register, the functions ''f'', ''g'', are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of <math>|b\\rangle</math> is in the ill-conditioned subspace of ''A'' and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion. Producing a state proportional to the inverse of ''A'' requires 'well' to be measured, after which the overall state of the system collapses to the desired state by the extended [[Born rule]].\n\n=== Main loop ===\nThe body of the algorithm follows the [[amplitude amplification]] procedure: starting with <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}B|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math>, the following operation is repeatedly applied:\n\n: <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}BR_\\mathrm{init}B^\\dagger U^\\dagger_\\mathrm{invert}R_\\mathrm{succ}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{succ}=I-2|\\mathrm{well}\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{well}|,</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{init}=I-2|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle\\langle\\mathrm{initial}|.</math>\n\nAfter each repetition, <math>S</math> is measured and will produce a value of 'nothing', 'well', or 'ill' as described above. This loop is repeated until <math>S</math> is measured, which occurs with a probability <math>p</math>. Rather than repeating <math>\\frac{1}{p}</math> times to minimize error, amplitude amplification is used to achieve the same error resilience using only <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}}\\right)</math> repetitions.\n\n=== Scalar measurement ===\nAfter successfully measuring 'well' on <math>S</math> the system will be in a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i \\lambda^{-1}_j |u_j\\rangle = A^{-1} |b \\rangle = | x\\rangle.</math>\n\nFinally, we perform the quantum-mechanical operator corresponding to M and obtain an estimate of the value of <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\n== Run time analysis ==\n\n=== Classical efficiency ===\nThe best classical algorithm which produces the actual solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is [[Gaussian elimination]], which runs in <math>O(N^3)</math> time.\n\nIf ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and positive semi-definite, then the [[Conjugate Gradient method]] can be used to find the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math>, which can be found in <math>O(Ns\\kappa)</math> time by minimizing the quadratic function <math>|A\\overrightarrow{x} -\\overrightarrow{b}|^2</math>.\n\nWhen only a summary statistic of the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is needed, as is the case for the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, a classical computer can find an estimate of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}^\\dagger M \\overrightarrow{x}</math> in <math>O(N\\sqrt{\\kappa})</math>.\n\n=== Quantum efficiency ===\nThe runtime of the quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations originally proposed by Harrow et al. was shown to be <math>O(\\kappa^2\\log N/\\varepsilon)</math>, where  <math>\\varepsilon>0</math> is the error parameter and <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[condition number]] of <math>A</math>.

As the condition number increases, the ease with which the solution vector can be found using gradient descent methods such as the [[conjugate gradient method]] decreases, as <math>A</math> becomes closer to a matrix which cannot be inverted and the solution vector becomes less stable. This algorithm assumes that all elements of the matrix <math>A</math> lie between <math>\\frac{1}{\\kappa}</math> and 1, in which case the claimed run-time proportional to <math>\\kappa^2</math> will be achieved. Therefore, the speedup over classical algorithms is increased further when <math>\\kappa</math> is a <math>\\mathrm{poly}(\\log(N))</math>.<ref name=\"Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al.\"/>\n\nIf the run-time of the algorithm were made poly-logarithmic in <math>\\kappa</math> then problems solvable on ''n'' qubits could be solved in poly(''n'') time, causing the complexity class [[BQP]] to be equal to [[PSPACE]].<ref name=\"Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al.\"/>\n\n== Error analysis ==\nPerforming the Hamiltonian simulation, which is the dominant source of error, is done by simulating <math>e^{iAt}</math>. Assuming that <math>A</math> is s-sparse, this can be done with an error bounded by a constant <math>\\varepsilon</math>, which will translate to the additive error achieved in the output state <math>|x\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe phase estimation step errs by <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{t_0}\\right)</math> in estimating <math>\\lambda</math>, which translates into a relative error of <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda t_0}\\right)</math> in <math>\\lambda^{-1}</math>. If <math>\\lambda \\ge 1/\\kappa </math>, taking <math>t_0=O(\\kappa\\varepsilon)</math> induces a final error of <math>\\varepsilon</math>. This requires that the overall run-time efficiency be increased proportional to <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)</math> to minimize error.\n\n== Experimental realization ==\nWhile there does not yet exist a quantum computer that can truly offer a speedup over a classical computer, implementation of a \"proof of concept\" remains an important milestone in the development of a new quantum algorithm.

The quantum circuit is optimized and compiled into a linear optical network with four photonic quantum bits (qubits) and four controlled logic gates, which is used to coherently implement every subroutine for this algorithm. For various input vectors, the quantum computer gives solutions for the linear equations with reasonably high precision, ranging from fidelities of 0.825 to 0.993.<ref name=\"Experimental quantum computing to solve systems of linear equations by Cai et al: Arxiv\">{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1302.4310|last1 = Cai|first1 = X. -D|title = Experimental Quantum Computing to Solve Systems of Linear Equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 110|issue = 23|pages = 230501|last2 = Weedbrook|first2 = Christian|last3 = Su|first3 = Z. -E|last4 = Chen|first4 = M. -C|last5 = Gu|first5 = Mile|last6 = Zhu|first6 = M. -J|last7 = Li|first7 = L|last8 = Liu|first8 = N. -L|last9 = Lu|first9 = Chao-Yang|last10 = Pan|first10 = Jian-Wei|year = 2013|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.230501|pmid = 25167475|bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110w0501C}}</ref>\n\n=== Barz et al. ===\nOn February 5, 2013,  [[Stefanie Barz]] and co-workers demonstrated the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations on a photonic quantum computing architecture.

For certain problems, quantum algorithms supply exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, the most famous example being Shor's factoring algorithm. Few such exponential speedups are known, and those that are (such as the use of quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems) have so far found limited use outside the domain of quantum mechanics. This algorithm provides an exponentially faster method of estimating features of the solution of a set of linear equations, which is a problem ubiquitous in science and engineering, both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems.\n\n=== Electromagnetic scattering ===\nClader et al. provided a preconditioned version of the linear systems algorithm that provided two advances. First, they demonstrated how a [[preconditioner]] could be included within the quantum algorithm.

This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> itself, but rather the result of applying some operator <math>M</math> onto x, <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\nFirst, the algorithm represents the vector <math>\\overrightarrow{b}</math> as a [[quantum state]] of the form:\n: <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N b_i|i\\rangle.</math>\n\nNext, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator <math>e^{iAt}</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> for a superposition of different times <math>t</math>. The ability to decompose <math>|b\\rangle</math> into the eigenbasis of <math>A</math> and to find the corresponding eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_j</math> is facilitated by the use of [[quantum phase estimation]].\n\nThe state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle|\\lambda_j\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>u_j</math> is the eigenvector basis of <math>A</math>, and <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle</math>.\n\nWe would then like to perform the linear map taking <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> to <math>C\\lambda^{-1}_j|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math>, where <math>C</math> is a normalizing constant. The linear mapping operation is not unitary and thus will require a number of repetitions as it has some probability of failing. After it succeeds, we uncompute the <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> register and are left with a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i\\lambda^{-1}_j|u_j\\rangle=A^{-1}|b\\rangle=|x\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|x\\rangle</math> is a quantum-mechanical representation of the desired solution vector&nbsp;''x''. To read out all components of ''x'' would require the procedure be repeated at least ''N'' times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in <math>x</math> itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator ''M'' acting on&nbsp;''x''. By mapping ''M'' to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to ''M'', we obtain an estimate of the expectation value <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector ''x'' to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector&nbsp;''x''.\n\n== Explanation of the algorithm ==\n\n=== Initialization ===\nFirstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix <math>A</math> be [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] so that it can be converted into a [[unitary operator]]. In the case where <math>A</math> is not Hermitian, define \n:<math>\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & A \\\\\n     A^t & 0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nAs <math>C</math> is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve <math>Cy=\\begin{bmatrix}\n     b \\\\\n     0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math> to obtain <math>y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 \\\\\n     x  \n  \\end{bmatrix} </math>.\n\nSecondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare <math>|b\\rangle</math>, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator <math>B</math> that can take some arbitrary quantum state <math>|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given <math>|b\\rangle</math> as input. Any error in the preparation of state <math>|b\\rangle</math> is ignored.\n\nFinally, the algorithm assumes that the state <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> can be prepared efficiently. Where\n\n: <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle := \\sqrt{2/T} \\sum_{\\tau \\mathop =0}^{T-1} \\sin\\pi\\left(\\tfrac{\\tau+\\tfrac{1}{2}}{T}\\right) |\\tau\\rangle</math>\n\nfor some large <math>T</math>. The coefficients of <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine described below.\n\n=== Hamiltonian simulation ===\n[[Hamiltonian simulation]] is used to transform the Hermitian matrix <math>A</math> into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most ''s'' nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time&nbsp;O(''s''). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows <math>e^{iAt}</math> to be simulated in time <math>O(\\log(N)s^2t)</math>.\n\n=== <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine ===\nThe key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math>, is defined as follows and incorporates a [[phase estimation]] subroutine:\n\n1. Prepare <math>|\\psi_0\\rangle^C</math> on register ''C''\n\n2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)\n\n3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register&nbsp;''C''. Denote the resulting basis states with <math>|k\\rangle</math> for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''T''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. Define <math>\\lambda_k:=2\\pi k/t_0</math>.\n\n4. Adjoin a three-dimensional register ''S'' in the state\n: <math>|h(\\lambda_k)\\rangle^S := \\sqrt{1-f(\\lambda_k)^2 - g(\\lambda_k)^2} |\\mathrm{nothing} \\rangle^S + f(\\lambda_k)| \\mathrm{well} \\rangle^S+g (\\lambda_k) | \\mathrm{ill} \\rangle^S, </math>\n\n5. Reverse steps 1\u20133, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.\n\nThe phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of ''A'' up to error <math>\\epsilon</math>.\n\nThe ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of ''A''.  In this register, the functions ''f'', ''g'', are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of <math>|b\\rangle</math> is in the ill-conditioned subspace of ''A'' and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion. Producing a state proportional to the inverse of ''A'' requires 'well' to be measured, after which the overall state of the system collapses to the desired state by the extended [[Born rule]].\n\n=== Main loop ===\nThe body of the algorithm follows the [[amplitude amplification]] procedure: starting with <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}B|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math>, the following operation is repeatedly applied:\n\n: <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}BR_\\mathrm{init}B^\\dagger U^\\dagger_\\mathrm{invert}R_\\mathrm{succ}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{succ}=I-2|\\mathrm{well}\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{well}|,</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{init}=I-2|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle\\langle\\mathrm{initial}|.</math>\n\nAfter each repetition, <math>S</math> is measured and will produce a value of 'nothing', 'well', or 'ill' as described above. This loop is repeated until <math>S</math> is measured, which occurs with a probability <math>p</math>. Rather than repeating <math>\\frac{1}{p}</math> times to minimize error, amplitude amplification is used to achieve the same error resilience using only <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}}\\right)</math> repetitions.\n\n=== Scalar measurement ===\nAfter successfully measuring 'well' on <math>S</math> the system will be in a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i \\lambda^{-1}_j |u_j\\rangle = A^{-1} |b \\rangle = | x\\rangle.</math>\n\nFinally, we perform the quantum-mechanical operator corresponding to M and obtain an estimate of the value of <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\n== Run time analysis ==\n\n=== Classical efficiency ===\nThe best classical algorithm which produces the actual solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is [[Gaussian elimination]], which runs in <math>O(N^3)</math> time.\n\nIf ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and positive semi-definite, then the [[Conjugate Gradient method]] can be used to find the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math>, which can be found in <math>O(Ns\\kappa)</math> time by minimizing the quadratic function <math>|A\\overrightarrow{x} -\\overrightarrow{b}|^2</math>.\n\nWhen only a summary statistic of the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is needed, as is the case for the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, a classical computer can find an estimate of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}^\\dagger M \\overrightarrow{x}</math> in <math>O(N\\sqrt{\\kappa})</math>.\n\n=== Quantum efficiency ===\nThe runtime of the quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations originally proposed by Harrow et al. was shown to be <math>O(\\kappa^2\\log N/\\varepsilon)</math>, where  <math>\\varepsilon>0</math> is the error parameter and <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[condition number]] of <math>A</math>.

As the condition number increases, the ease with which the solution vector can be found using gradient descent methods such as the [[conjugate gradient method]] decreases, as <math>A</math> becomes closer to a matrix which cannot be inverted and the solution vector becomes less stable.

Therefore, the speedup over classical algorithms is increased further when <math>\\kappa</math> is a <math>\\mathrm{poly}(\\log(N))</math>.<ref name=\"Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al.\"/>\n\nIf the run-time of the algorithm were made poly-logarithmic in <math>\\kappa</math> then problems solvable on ''n'' qubits could be solved in poly(''n'') time, causing the complexity class [[BQP]] to be equal to [[PSPACE]].<ref name=\"Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al.\"/>\n\n== Error analysis ==\nPerforming the Hamiltonian simulation, which is the dominant source of error, is done by simulating <math>e^{iAt}</math>. Assuming that <math>A</math> is s-sparse, this can be done with an error bounded by a constant <math>\\varepsilon</math>, which will translate to the additive error achieved in the output state <math>|x\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe phase estimation step errs by <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{t_0}\\right)</math> in estimating <math>\\lambda</math>, which translates into a relative error of <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda t_0}\\right)</math> in <math>\\lambda^{-1}</math>. If <math>\\lambda \\ge 1/\\kappa </math>, taking <math>t_0=O(\\kappa\\varepsilon)</math> induces a final error of <math>\\varepsilon</math>.

For certain problems, quantum algorithms supply exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, the most famous example being Shor's factoring algorithm. Few such exponential speedups are known, and those that are (such as the use of quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems) have so far found limited use outside the domain of quantum mechanics. This algorithm provides an exponentially faster method of estimating features of the solution of a set of linear equations, which is a problem ubiquitous in science and engineering, both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems.\n\n=== Electromagnetic scattering ===\nClader et al. provided a preconditioned version of the linear systems algorithm that provided two advances.

This expands the class of problems that can achieve the promised exponential speedup, since the scaling of HHL and the best classical algorithms are both polynomial in the [[condition number]]. The second advance was the demonstration of how to use HHL to solve for the [[radar cross-section]] of a complex shape. This was one of the first end to end examples of how to use HHL to solve a concrete problem exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm.<ref name=\"Preconditioned quantum linear system algorithm by Clader et al.\">{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.250504|pmid = 23829722|title = Preconditioned Quantum Linear System Algorithm|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 110|issue = 25|pages = 250504|year = 2013|last1 = Clader|first1 = B.

Tasks in machine learning frequently involve manipulating and classifying a large volume of data in high-dimensional vector spaces. The runtime of classical machine learning algorithms is limited by a polynomial dependence on both the volume of data and the dimensions of the space. Quantum computers are capable of manipulating high-dimensional vectors using tensor product spaces and are thus the perfect platform for machine learning algorithms.<ref name=\"Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning by Lloyd et al.\">{{Cite arxiv|eprint = 1307.0411|last1 = Lloyd|first1 = Seth|title = Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning|last2 = Mohseni|first2 = Masoud|last3 = Rebentrost|first3 = Patrick|year = 2013|class = quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThe quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations has been applied to a support vector machine, which is an optimized linear or non-linear binary classifier. A support vector machine can be used for supervised machine learning, in which  training set of already classified data is available, or unsupervised machine learning, in which all data given to the system is unclassified.
