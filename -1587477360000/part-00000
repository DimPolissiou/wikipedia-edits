It is based on [[Forrest Gump (novel)|the 1986 novel of the same name]] by [[Winston Groom]], and stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Mykelti Williamson]], and [[Sally Field]]. The story depicts several decades in the life of [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.\n\nP\n\n\n\nrincipal photography took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The [[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.\n\n''Forrest Gump'' was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received favorable reviews for Zemeckis' directing, Hanks' performance, the visual effects, the music and the script. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over {{US$|677{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the [[1994 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1994]]. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. ''Forrest Gump'' won the [[Academy Awards]] for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many [[List of accolades received by Forrest Gump|award nominations]], including [[Golden Globe]]s, [[British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you wouldn't believe me if I told you, but I could run like the wind blows.

In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Forrest Gump join Library of Congress film trove\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-11-240/2011-national-film-registry-more-than-a-box-of-chocolates/2011-12-28/|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/forrest-gump-bollywood-remake-works-1194721|title='Forrest Gump' Bollywood Remake in the Works|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn 1981, a white feather drifts down out of the sky and lands at a bus stop in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A man named Forrest Gump picks it up and places it in his copy of the children's book ''[[Curious George]]''. He then recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.\n\nIn 1951 in Greenbow, [[Alabama]], young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and is unable to walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young [[Elvis Presley]], who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his famous performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. \n\nForrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. While fleeing from some bullies, his braces fall off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a [[American football|football]] [[scholarship]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1963; he witnesses [[List of governors of Alabama|Alabama Governor]] [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|stand in the schoolhouse door]], becomes a top [[kick returner]], is named to the [[College Football All-America Team|All-American team]], and meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] Following that, Forrest remembers the Kennedy assassination, when [[Lee Harvey Oswald|somebody shot]] the President in [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963]] and [[Sirhan Sirhan|somebody shot]] his younger brother in [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|1968]].\n\nAfter his college graduation, Forrest enlists into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], where he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"Bubba\", who convinces Forrest to go into the [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] business with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], serving with the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] region. After a few routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. While trying to find Bubba, Forrest ends up finding and saving several wounded platoon-mates\u2014including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs\u2014and is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nAt the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] \"[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"|March on the Pentagon]]\" rally, Forrest meets [[Abbie Hoffman]] and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a [[hippie]] lifestyle. He also develops a talent for [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in [[ping-pong diplomacy]], earning him an interview alongside [[John Lennon]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. Following that, then Forrest remembers that [[Mark David Chapman|somebody shot]] John Lennon in [[Murder of John Lennon|1980]]. \n\nIn [[New York City]], he spends Christmas and the 1972 new year with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an embittered cripple. Forrest soon meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and stays in the [[Watergate complex]], where he accidentally exposes the [[Watergate scandal]], forcing Nixon to resign in 1974. Forrest Gump is officially discharged from the army after the war ends.\n\nReturning to Greenbow, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre]], fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive [[Hurricane Carmen]], they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], after which Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Lieutenant Dan invests into [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer, Inc.]] and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also gives half of the earnings to Bubba's family, giving them a better life. Forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of [[cancer]].\n\nIn 1976, Jenny\u2014recovering from years of drugs and abuse returns to visit Forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. That night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running, and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again before returning home to Greenbow.\n\nIn the present, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. The strangers say that the address on the letter is only a few blocks away, and Forrest immediately takes off. \n\nAs Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to their son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, so Forrest has Jenny and Forrest Jr move back to Greenbow with him. \n\nJenny and Forrest finally marry, with Lt. Dan serving as best man while wearing his new prosthetic legs. Sadly, Jenny is overcome by the virus and dies a year later. \n\nAt her grave some time later, Forrest tells Jenny that he had her father's house bulldozed to the ground, and that little Forrest is doing well. \n\nThe film ends with Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school. Forrest notices that Jr has his ''Curious George'' book, as he wants to take it to school for show-and-tell. When Forrest opens the book, the white feather from the beginning of the film falls to the ground. He waves goodbye to Forrest Jr as the school bus leaves, and then sits down on a log as the wind blows and carries the feather back into the sky.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Tom Hanks]] (left) and [[Gary Sinise]] (right) on the film set in 1993.\n| image1 = TomHanksForrestGump94.jpg\n| width1 = 149\n| alt1 = A man is at the center of the image smiling into the camera.

She argues that this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jennifer|title=\"A Struggle of Contending Stories\": Race, Gender, and Political Memory in \"Forrest Gump\"|journal=Cinema Journal|date=Spring 2000|volume=39|issue=3|pages=92\u2013115|doi=10.1353/cj.2000.0009}}</ref> Wang argues that the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a \"traditional version of recent history\" to gear voters towards their ideology for the congressional elections.<ref name=\"WangStruggle\" /> Presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] stated that the film's message was \"no matter how great the adversity, the American Dream is within everybody's reach.\"<ref name=\"WangStruggle\" />\n\nIn 1995, ''[[National Review]]'' included ''Forrest Gump'' in its list of the \"Best 100 Conservative Movies\" of all time,<ref name=\"100ConMov\">{{cite news|last=Quillen|first=Ed|title=Why are modern conservatives so enchanted with Forrest Gump?|work=Denver Post|date=May 7, 1995}}</ref> and ranked it number four on its 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years list.<ref name=\"NRRanks\">{{cite news|last=Miller |first=John J. |title=The Best Conservative Movies |url=http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=YWQ4MDlhMWRkZDQ5YmViMDM1Yzc0MTE3ZTllY2E3MGM= |url-status=dead |work=[[National Review]] |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026032717/http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=YWQ4MDlhMWRkZDQ5YmViMDM1Yzc0MTE3ZTllY2E3MGM%3D |archivedate=October 26, 2010  }}</ref> \"Tom Hanks plays the title character, an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s.

Burton claims that the film's content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s, which emphasized family values and American values, epitomized in the book ''Hollywood vs. America''. He claims that this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film, which allowed many different political interpretations.<ref name=\"Burton September 2007\">{{cite journal|last=Burton|first=James Amos|title= Film, History and Cultural Memory: Cinematic Representations of Vietnam-Era America During the Culture Wars, 1987\u20131995|journal=PHD Thesis|date=September 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome commentators see the conservative readings of ''Forrest Gump'' as indicating the death of irony in American culture.

It is based on [[Forrest Gump (novel)|the 1986 novel of the same name]] by [[Winston Groom]], and stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Mykelti Williamson]], and [[Sally Field]]. The story depicts several decades in the life of [[Forrest Gump (character)|Forrest Gump]] (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The [[Forrest Gump (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.\n\n''Forrest Gump'' was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received favorable reviews for Zemeckis' directing, Hanks' performance, the visual effects, the music and the script. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over {{US$|677{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the [[1994 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1994]]. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. ''Forrest Gump'' won the [[Academy Awards]] for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many [[List of accolades received by Forrest Gump|award nominations]], including [[Golden Globe]]s, [[British Academy Film Awards]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nVarying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism. In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Forrest Gump join Library of Congress film trove\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-11-240/2011-national-film-registry-more-than-a-box-of-chocolates/2011-12-28/|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/forrest-gump-bollywood-remake-works-1194721|title='Forrest Gump' Bollywood Remake in the Works|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn 1981, a white feather drifts down out of the sky and lands at a bus stop in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A man named Forrest Gump picks it up and places it in his copy of the children's book ''[[Curious George]]''. He then recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.\n\nIn 1951 in Greenbow, [[Alabama]], young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and is unable to walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young [[Elvis Presley]], who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his famous performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. \n\nForrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. While fleeing from some bullies, his braces fall off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a [[American football|football]] [[scholarship]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1963; he witnesses [[List of governors of Alabama|Alabama Governor]] [[George Wallace]]'s [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|stand in the schoolhouse door]], becomes a top [[kick returner]], is named to the [[College Football All-America Team|All-American team]], and meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] Following that, Forrest remembers the Kennedy assassination, when [[Lee Harvey Oswald|somebody shot]] the President in [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963]] and [[Sirhan Sirhan|somebody shot]] his younger brother in [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|1968]].\n\nAfter his college graduation, Forrest enlists into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], where he befriends a fellow soldier nicknamed \"Bubba\", who convinces Forrest to go into the [[Shrimp fishery|shrimping]] business with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], serving with the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] region. After a few routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. While trying to find Bubba, Forrest ends up finding and saving several wounded platoon-mates\u2014including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs\u2014and is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nAt the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] \"[[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"|March on the Pentagon]]\" rally, Forrest meets [[Abbie Hoffman]] and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a [[hippie]] lifestyle. He also develops a talent for [[Table tennis|ping-pong]], and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in [[ping-pong diplomacy]], earning him an interview alongside [[John Lennon]] on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. Following that, then Forrest remembers that [[Mark David Chapman|somebody shot]] John Lennon in [[Murder of John Lennon|1980]]. \n\nIn [[New York City]], he spends Christmas and the 1972 new year with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an embittered cripple. Forrest soon meets [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and stays in the [[Watergate complex]], where he accidentally exposes the [[Watergate scandal]], forcing Nixon to resign in 1974. Forrest Gump is officially discharged from the army after the war ends.\n\nReturning to Greenbow, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in [[Bayou La Batre, Alabama|Bayou La Batre]], fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive [[Hurricane Carmen]], they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the [[Bubba Gump Shrimp Company]], after which Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Lieutenant Dan invests into [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer, Inc.]] and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also gives half of the earnings to Bubba's family, giving them a better life. Forrest then returns home to see his mother as she dies of [[cancer]].\n\nIn 1976, Jenny\u2014recovering from years of drugs and abuse returns to visit Forrest, and after a while he proposes to her. That night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running, and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again before returning home to Greenbow.\n\nIn the present, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. The strangers say that the address on the letter is only a few blocks away, and Forrest immediately takes off. \n\nAs Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to their son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, so Forrest has Jenny and Forrest Jr move back to Greenbow with him. \n\nJenny and Forrest finally marry, with Lt. Dan serving as best man while wearing his new prosthetic legs. Sadly, Jenny is overcome by the virus and dies a year later. \n\nAt her grave some time later, Forrest tells Jenny that he had her father's house bulldozed to the ground, and that little Forrest is doing well. \n\nThe film ends with Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school. Forrest notices that Jr has his ''Curious George'' book, as he wants to take it to school for show-and-tell. When Forrest opens the book, the white feather from the beginning of the film falls to the ground. He waves goodbye to Forrest Jr as the school bus leaves, and then sits down on a log as the wind blows and carries the feather back into the sky.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Tom Hanks]] (left) and [[Gary Sinise]] (right) on the film set in 1993.\n| image1 = TomHanksForrestGump94.jpg\n| width1 = 149\n| alt1 = A man is at the center of the image smiling into the camera.
