The route crossed the summits of the [[Pas de Morgins]] and [[Le Corbier]] before arriving in [[Morzine]] for the final ascent. Hinault strengthened his claim on the overall victory by escaping early with Luis Herrera, who by now was too far down in the general classification to be a threat. Instead, he collected the points for the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], a lead which he would hold until the end of the race. Herrera also won the stage, seven seconds ahead of Hinault. LeMond lost 1:41, coming in fifth in a group with Delgado and [[Fabio Parra]] ({{ct|CAF|1985|nolink=yes}}).

Hinault, who was generally accepted as the ''patron'', meaning the most influential rider, was unhappy with the acceleration in the field, as he wanted the tempo to remain slow. This led to an altercation between the two, with Hinault driving up to Pelier and to complain.{{sfn|Moore|2014|pp=53\u201354}}{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=259}}{{efn|The split between Pelier and Hinault lasted over a year, until they became friends when Pelier supported Hinault during the [[1986 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|1986 World Championships]].

As they approached the finish, Bauer's rear wheel hit a piece of traffic furniture. As his bike moved sideways, it touched Anderson's, who crashed and brought down Hinault with him. The latter suffered a broken nose, but was able to finish the stage. As the accident had occurred within the final kilometre, the time he lost in the crash was not counted. However, Hinault rode the rest of the Tour with a stitched nose and two black eyes, caused by his sunglasses breaking when he fell.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2015|p=259}}{{sfn|Moore|2011|pp=152\u2013153}}{{sfn|Rendell|2008|p=214}} As a result of LeMond finishing ahead of him, Hinault's overall lead was cut down to 3:32 minutes.<ref name=stage14/>\n\nStage 15 was another transition stage. [[Hennie Kuiper]] ({{ct|Verandalux|1985b}}), winner of [[1985 Milan\u2013San Remo|Milan\u2013San Remo]] earlier in the year, did not take the start.

After he was recaptured, another attack went, containing Jo\u00ebl Pelier. Hinault, suffering from his injuries, was unhappy with the accelerations and brought the escape group back himself, not least due to the participation of Pelier. After {{convert|134|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Eduardo Chozas]] ({{ct|MOV|1985|nolink=yes}}) attacked on a downhill section and managed to get away from the peloton.

On the Tourmalet, Hinault had to let LeMond, [[Stephen Roche]] and [[Pedro Delgado]] go. Delgado then left on his own, with Roche chasing him, and LeMond staying close to Roche, who was the biggest threat in the general classification. LeMond felt that he was stronger, and asked his team director [[Paul Koechli]] permission to attack. Koechli refused that, and told LeMond to stay with Roche. LeMond stayed with Roche while some other cyclists caught up and Herrera and [[Fabio Parra]] went clear of the group.

On the Tourmalet, Hinault had to let LeMond, [[Stephen Roche]] and [[Pedro Delgado]] go. Delgado then left on his own, with Roche chasing him, and LeMond staying close to Roche, who was the biggest threat in the general classification. LeMond felt that he was stronger, and asked his team director [[Paul Koechli]] permission to attack. Koechli refused that, and told LeMond to stay with Roche.

He was the [[List of British Monarchs#House of Hanover (1714\u20131901)|first British monarch]] of the [[House of Hanover]].\n\nBorn in [[Hanover]] to its [[Elector Ernest Augustus]] and [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia]], George inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg from his father and uncles. A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime; he was ratified as [[prince-elector]] of Hanover in 1708. After the deaths in 1714 of his mother and his second cousin [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]] (r. 1702\u20131714), George ascended the [[British throne]] as Anne's closest living [[Protestant]] relative under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]. [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] attempted, but failed, to depose George and replace him with [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], Anne's [[Catholic]] half-brother.\n\nDuring George's reign, the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of [[cabinet government]] led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual political power was held by [[Robert Walpole]], now recognised as Britain's first ''de facto'' [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried. He is the most recent British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom.\n\n==Early life==\nGeorge was born on 28 May 1660 in the city of [[Hanover]] in the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{efn|The story that George I died in the same room as that in which he was born at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] (in, for example, [[Louis Mor\u00e9ri|''Le Grand Dictionnaire Historique'']] of 1759) is contradicted by the [[Electress Sophia]] in her ''Memoiren der Herzogin Sophie nachmals Kurf\u00fcrstin von Hannover'' (ed. A. K\u00f6cher, Leipzig, 1879, pp. 1 and 68) who says that her two eldest sons were born at Hanover, and by four notifications from Hanover to the court at Wolfenb\u00fcttel preserved in the Wolfenb\u00fcttel state archives.<ref>{{cite book|title=L'Allemagne Dynastique, Tome III|year=1981|publisher=Alain Giraud|location=Le Perreux|language=French|isbn=978-2-901138-03-7|page=85|first1=Michel|first2=Alain|first3=F. et B.|last1=Huberty|last2=Giraud|last3=Magdelaine}}</ref>}} He was the eldest son of [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Ernest Augustus]], Duke of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], and his wife, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia of the Palatinate]].

George's brother, [[Frederick Augustus of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Frederick Augustus]], was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as ''G\u00f6rgen'' and ''Gustchen'' by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664\u201365) during a long convalescent holiday in [[Italy]], but corresponded regularly with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hatton|first=Ragnhild|authorlink=Ragnhild Hatton|title=George I: Elector and King| year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-25060-0|pages=26\u201328}}</ref> Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.<ref name=\"p29\">Hatton, p. 29</ref>\n\nBy 1675 George's eldest uncle had died without issue, but his remaining two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass to their own sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.<ref>Hatton, p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 1679 another uncle died unexpectedly without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]]-[[Principality of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], with his capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|George William of Celle]], had married his mistress in order to legitimise his only daughter, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle|Sophia Dorothea]], but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under [[Salic law]], where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of [[primogeniture]], meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have to share it with his brothers.<ref>Hatton, p. 30</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:George I as Prince of Hanover.jpg|thumb|left|George in 1680, aged 20, when he was Prince of Hanover. After a painting by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]].]]\nThe same year, George married his first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws. The [[marriage of state]] was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother at first opposed the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother, [[\u00c9l\u00e9onore Desmier d'Olbreuse|Eleonore]] (who came from lower nobility), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.<ref>Hatton, pp. 36, 42</ref>\n\nIn 1683 George and his brother Frederick Augustus served in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]], and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, [[George II of Great Britain|George Augustus]]. The following year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning he would no longer receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. This led to a breach between Frederick Augustus and his father, and between the brothers, that lasted until his death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.<ref>Hatton, pp. 43\u201346</ref>\n\nSophia Dorothea had a second child, a daughter named after her, in 1687, but there were no other pregnancies. The couple became estranged\u2014George preferred the company of his mistress, [[Melusine von der Schulenburg]], and Sophia Dorothea had her own romance with the Swedish Count [[Philip Christoph von K\u00f6nigsmarck]]. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and mother, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694 the Swedish count was killed, possibly with George's connivance, and his body thrown into the river [[Leine]] weighted with stones. The murder was claimed to have been committed by four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers, one of whom, Don Nicol\u00f2 Montalbano, was paid the enormous sum of 150,000 [[thaler]]s, about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest-paid minister.<ref name=\"pp51\">Hatton, pp. 51\u201361</ref> Later rumours supposed that K\u00f6nigsmarck was hacked to pieces and buried beneath the Hanover palace floorboards.<ref>{{cite book| first = Michael |last=Farquhar| title = A Treasury of Royal Scandals| url = https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq | url-access = registration | year = 2001| location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn = 978-0-7394-2025-6| page = [https://archive.org/details/treasuryofroyals00farq/page/152 152] }}</ref> However, sources in Hanover itself, including Sophia, denied any knowledge of K\u00f6nigsmarck's whereabouts.<ref name=\"pp51\"/>\n\nGeorge's marriage to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, not on the grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but on the grounds that Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With her father's agreement, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in [[Ahlden House]] in her native [[Celle]], where she stayed until she died more than thirty years later. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle under supervision.<ref>Hatton, pp. 60\u201364</ref> Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701.\n\n==Electoral reign==\n[[File:George I Elector of Hanover.jpg|thumb|George in 1706, when he was [[Elector of Hanover]].

By the terms of the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], George's mother, Sophia, was designated as the heir to the English throne if the then reigning monarch, [[William III of England|William III]], and his sister-in-law, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], died without surviving issue. The [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] was so designed because Sophia was the closest Protestant relative of the [[British royal family]].

William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive to the new Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, thirty-five years older than Anne, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or for her son.<ref>Hatton, pp. 75\u201376</ref> However, it was George who understood the complexities of English politics and [[History of the British constitution|constitutional law]], which required further [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705|acts in 1705]] to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council.<ref>Hatton, pp. 77\u201378</ref> In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]]-[[Principality of Grubenhagen|Grubenhagen]], centred at [[Celle]].<ref>Hatton, p. 90</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanover1720.png|thumb|left|Sketch map of Hanover, c. 1720, showing the relative locations of [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Hanover]], [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr\u00fcck]]. During George's lifetime Hanover acquired [[Saxe-Lauenburg|Lauenburg]] and [[Bremen-Verden]].]]\n\nShortly after George's accession in Hanover, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] broke out. At issue was the right of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], the grandson of King [[Louis XIV of France]], to succeed to the Spanish throne under the terms of King [[Charles II of Spain]]'s [[will (law)|will]]. The Holy Roman Empire, the [[United Dutch Provinces]], England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French [[House of Bourbon]] would become too powerful if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few lives lost. As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the [[Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg]] by George's uncle was recognised by the British and Dutch.<ref>Hatton, pp. 86\u201389</ref>\n\nIn 1706 the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] was deprived of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with command of the imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the [[Duke of Marlborough]], into a diversionary attack, and partly because [[Emperor Joseph I]] appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes thought he had acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him; he understood they were part of a plan to lure French forces away from the main attack.<ref>Hatton, pp. 101\u2013104, 122</ref>\n\nIn 1709 George resigned as field marshal, never to go on active service again. In 1710 he was granted the dignity of [[Arch-Treasurer]] of the Empire,<ref>Hatton, p. 104</ref> an office formerly held by the [[Elector Palatine]]; the absence of the Elector of Bavaria allowed a reshuffling of offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/hre.htm#Household|title=Holy Roman Empire|last=Velde|first=Fran\u00e7ois R.|date=26 September 2006|website=Heraldica|accessdate=20 August 2007}}</ref> The emperor's death in 1711 threatened to destroy the balance of power in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but removed from the French line of succession, and the Elector of Bavaria was restored.\n\n==Accession in Great Britain and Ireland==\n[[File:George I Oval.jpg|thumb|George c.1714, the year of his succession, as painted by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]]]]\nThough both England and Scotland recognised Anne as their queen, only the [[English Parliament]] had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession question for the Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill declaring that their selection for Queen Anne's successor would not be the same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. At first [[Royal Assent]] was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the [[Act of Security 1704]]. In response the English Parliament passed measures that threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession.<ref>{{cite book| last = Whatley| first = Christopher A.|title=Bought and Sold for English Gold?: Explaining the Union of 1707, Second edition| year=2001|publisher=Tuckwell Press|location=East Linton, Scotland|isbn=978-1-86232-140-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Riley|first=P.W.J.|title=The Union of England and Scotland: A Study in Anglo-Scottish Politics of the Eighteenth Century|year=1978|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|location=Totowa, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-8476-6155-8 }}</ref> Eventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and established the rules of succession as laid down by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=aep/Ann/6/11/contents|title=Union with Scotland Act 1706}}</ref> The union created the largest free trade area in 18th-century Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/treatyofunion/index.htm|title=The Treaty of Union|website=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=20 August 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518030803/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/treatyofunion/index.htm|archivedate=18 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[British Whig Party|Whig]] politicians believed Parliament had the right to determine the succession, and to bestow it on the nearest Protestant relative of the Queen, while many [[Tory|Tories]] were more inclined to believe in the [[hereditary right]] of the Catholic [[Stuarts]], who were nearer relations.

Several members of the defeated Tory Party sympathised with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], who sought to replace George with Anne's Catholic half-brother, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (called \"James III and VIII\" by his supporters and \"the Pretender\" by his opponents).

By the end of the year the rebellion had all but collapsed. In February 1716, facing defeat, James and Lord Mar fled to France.

In 1717 he contributed to the creation of the [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Triple Alliance]], an anti-Spanish league composed of Great Britain, France and the [[Dutch Republic]]. In 1718 the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was added to the body, which became known as the Quadruple Alliance. The subsequent [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] involved the same issue as the War of the Spanish Succession. The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713) had recognised the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, Philip, as king of Spain on the condition that he gave up his rights to succeed to the French throne. But upon Louis XIV's death in 1715, Philip sought to overturn the treaty.\n\nSpain supported a Jacobite-led invasion of Scotland in 1719, but stormy seas allowed only about three hundred Spanish troops to reach Scotland.<ref>Hatton, p. 239</ref> A base was established at [[Eilean Donan]] Castle on the west Scottish coast in April, only to be destroyed by British ships a month later.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lenman|first=Bruce|title=The Jacobite Risings in Britain 1689\u20131746|year=1980|publisher=Eyre Methuen|location=London|isbn=978-0-413-39650-1|pages=192\u2013193}}</ref> Jacobite attempts to recruit Scottish clansmen yielded a fighting force of only about a thousand men.

The invasion never posed any serious threat to George's government. With the French now fighting against him, Philip's armies fared poorly. As a result, the Spanish and French thrones remained separate. Simultaneously, Hanover gained from the resolution of the [[Great Northern War]], which had been caused by rivalry between [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] for control of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. The Swedish territories of [[Bremen-Verden|Bremen and Verden]] were ceded to Hanover in 1719, with Hanover paying Sweden monetary compensation for the loss of territory.<ref>Hatton, p. 238</ref>\n\n==Ministries==\n[[File:10 M\u00fcnzkabinett (8).JPG|thumb|A 1714 silver medallion from the reign of George I, referring to his accession in Great Britain.

All government expenditure above 50 thalers (between 12 and 13 [[British pound]]s), and the appointment of all army officers, all ministers, and even government officials above the level of copyist, was in his personal control. By contrast in Great Britain, George had to govern through Parliament.<ref>Williams, pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nIn 1715 when the Whigs came to power, George's chief ministers included [[Sir Robert Walpole]], [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law), [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]]. In 1717 Townshend was dismissed, and Walpole resigned from the Cabinet over disagreements with their colleagues;<ref>Dickinson, p. 49</ref> Stanhope became supreme in foreign affairs, and Sunderland the same in domestic matters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carswell|first=John|year=1960|title=The South Sea Bubble|location=London|publisher=Cresset Press|page=72}}</ref>\n\nLord Sunderland's power began to wane in 1719. He introduced a Peerage Bill that attempted to limit the size of the [[House of Lords]] by restricting new creations. The measure would have solidified Sunderland's control of the House by preventing the creation of opposition peers, but it was defeated after Walpole led the opposition to the bill by delivering what was considered \"the most brilliant speech of his career\".<ref name=\"hatton\">Hatton, pp. 244\u2013246</ref> Walpole and Townshend were reappointed as ministers the following year and a new, supposedly unified, Whig government formed.<ref name=\"hatton\" />\n\nGreater problems arose over financial speculation and the management of the national debt.

Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and [[Prussia]] of the [[Treaty of Hanover (1725)|Treaty of Hanover]], which was designed to counterbalance the Austro-Spanish [[Treaty of Vienna (1725)|Treaty of Vienna]] and protect British trade.<ref>Hatton, p. 274</ref>\n\nGeorge, although increasingly reliant on Walpole, could still have replaced his ministers at will. Walpole was actually afraid of being removed from office towards the end of George I's reign,<ref>\"George I\" (1911). ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 11th edition. London: Cambridge University Press.</ref> but such fears were put to an end when George died during his sixth trip to his native Hanover since his accession as king.

It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was prevented from doing so by his wife, [[Caroline of Ansbach]]. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability.<ref>Black, pp. 29\u201331, 53, and 61</ref> In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power of the sovereign.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:GeorgeIThornhill.jpg|thumb|George surrounded by his family, in a painting by [[James Thornhill]].]]\n[[File:Georg I.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] indicates such ambivalent feelings as he wrote: {{quote|His heart was in Hanover&nbsp;... He was more than fifty years of age when he came amongst us: we took him because we wanted him, because he served our turn; we laughed at his uncouth German ways, and sneered at him.

They in turn, influenced British authors of the first half of the twentieth century such as [[G. K. Chesterton]], who introduced further anti-German and anti-Protestant bias into the interpretation of George's reign. However, in the wake of World War II continental European archives were opened to historians of the later twentieth century and nationalistic anti-German feeling subsided. George's life and reign were re-explored by scholars such as Beattie and Hatton, and his character, abilities and motives re-assessed in a more generous light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Hannah|title=Georgian Monarchy: Politics and Culture, 1714\u20131760|year=2006| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-82876-5|pages=3\u20139}}</ref> [[John H.

He was the [[List of British Monarchs#House of Hanover (1714\u20131901)|first British monarch]] of the [[House of Hanover]].\n\nBorn in [[Hanover]] to its [[Elector Ernest Augustus]] and [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia]], George inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg from his father and uncles. A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime; he was ratified as [[prince-elector]] of Hanover in 1708. After the deaths in 1714 of his mother and his second cousin [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]] (r. 1702\u20131714), George ascended the [[British throne]] as Anne's closest living [[Protestant]] relative under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]. [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] attempted, but failed, to depose George and replace him with [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], Anne's [[Catholic]] half-brother.\n\nDuring George's reign, the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of [[cabinet government]] led by a prime minister. Towards the end of his reign, actual political power was held by [[Robert Walpole]], now recognised as Britain's first ''de facto'' [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. George died of a stroke on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried. He is the most recent British monarch to be buried outside the United Kingdom.\n\n==Early life==\nGeorge was born on 28 May 1660 in the city of [[Hanover]] in the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{efn|The story that George I died in the same room as that in which he was born at [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] (in, for example, [[Louis Mor\u00e9ri|''Le Grand Dictionnaire Historique'']] of 1759) is contradicted by the [[Electress Sophia]] in her ''Memoiren der Herzogin Sophie nachmals Kurf\u00fcrstin von Hannover'' (ed. A. K\u00f6cher, Leipzig, 1879, pp. 1 and 68) who says that her two eldest sons were born at Hanover, and by four notifications from Hanover to the court at Wolfenb\u00fcttel preserved in the Wolfenb\u00fcttel state archives.<ref>{{cite book|title=L'Allemagne Dynastique, Tome III|year=1981|publisher=Alain Giraud|location=Le Perreux|language=French|isbn=978-2-901138-03-7|page=85|first1=Michel|first2=Alain|first3=F. et B.|last1=Huberty|last2=Giraud|last3=Magdelaine}}</ref>}} He was the eldest son of [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Ernest Augustus]], Duke of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], and his wife, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia of the Palatinate]].

George's brother, [[Frederick Augustus of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Frederick Augustus]], was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as ''G\u00f6rgen'' and ''Gustchen'' by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664\u201365) during a long convalescent holiday in [[Italy]], but corresponded regularly with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hatton|first=Ragnhild|authorlink=Ragnhild Hatton|title=George I: Elector and King| year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-25060-0|pages=26\u201328}}</ref> Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.<ref name=\"p29\">Hatton, p. 29</ref>\n\nBy 1675 George's eldest uncle had died without issue, but his remaining two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass to their own sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.<ref>Hatton, p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 1679 another uncle died unexpectedly without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]]-[[Principality of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], with his capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|George William of Celle]], had married his mistress in order to legitimise his only daughter, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle|Sophia Dorothea]], but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under [[Salic law]], where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of [[primogeniture]], meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have to share it with his brothers.<ref>Hatton, p. 30</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:George I as Prince of Hanover.jpg|thumb|left|George in 1680, aged 20, when he was Prince of Hanover. After a painting by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]].]]\nThe same year, George married his first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws. The [[marriage of state]] was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother at first opposed the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother, [[\u00c9l\u00e9onore Desmier d'Olbreuse|Eleonore]] (who came from lower nobility), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.<ref>Hatton, pp. 36, 42</ref>\n\nIn 1683 George and his brother Frederick Augustus served in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]], and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, [[George II of Great Britain|George Augustus]]. The following year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning he would no longer receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. This led to a breach between Frederick Augustus and his father, and between the brothers, that lasted until his death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.<ref>Hatton, pp. 43\u201346</ref>\n\nSophia Dorothea had a second child, a daughter named after her, in 1687, but there were no other pregnancies. The couple became estranged\u2014George preferred the company of his mistress, [[Melusine von der Schulenburg]], and Sophia Dorothea had her own romance with the Swedish Count [[Philip Christoph von K\u00f6nigsmarck]]. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and mother, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694 the Swedish count was killed, possibly with George's connivance, and his body thrown into the river [[Leine]] weighted with stones.

At issue was the right of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], the grandson of King [[Louis XIV of France]], to succeed to the Spanish throne under the terms of King [[Charles II of Spain]]'s [[will (law)|will]]. The Holy Roman Empire, the [[United Dutch Provinces]], England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French [[House of Bourbon]] would become too powerful if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, [[Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few lives lost. As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the [[Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg]] by George's uncle was recognised by the British and Dutch.<ref>Hatton, pp. 86\u201389</ref>\n\nIn 1706 the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] was deprived of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with command of the imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the [[Duke of Marlborough]], into a diversionary attack, and partly because [[Emperor Joseph I]] appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes thought he had acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him; he understood they were part of a plan to lure French forces away from the main attack.<ref>Hatton, pp. 101\u2013104, 122</ref>\n\nIn 1709 George resigned as field marshal, never to go on active service again.

The [[Parliament of Scotland]] (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession question for the Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill declaring that their selection for Queen Anne's successor would not be the same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. At first [[Royal Assent]] was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the [[Act of Security 1704]].

Several members of the defeated Tory Party sympathised with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], who sought to replace George with Anne's Catholic half-brother, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (called \"James III and VIII\" by his supporters and \"the Pretender\" by his opponents). Some disgruntled Tories sided with [[Jacobite rising of 1715|a Jacobite rebellion]], which became known as \"The Fifteen\". James's supporters, led by [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1675\u20131732)|Lord Mar]], an embittered Scottish nobleman who had previously served as a secretary of state, instigated rebellion in Scotland where support for Jacobitism was stronger than in England. \"The Fifteen\", however, was a dismal failure; Lord Mar's battle plans were poor, and James arrived late with too little money and too few arms. By the end of the year the rebellion had all but collapsed. In February 1716, facing defeat, James and Lord Mar fled to France. After the rebellion was defeated, although there were some executions and forfeitures, George acted to moderate the Government's response, showed leniency, and spent the income from the forfeited estates on schools for Scotland and paying off part of the [[national debt]].<ref>Hatton, pp. 174\u201379</ref>\n\nGeorge's distrust of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Basil|authorlink=Basil Williams (historian)|others=Revised by C.&nbsp;H.

Walpole was actually afraid of being removed from office towards the end of George I's reign,<ref>\"George I\" (1911). ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 11th edition. London: Cambridge University Press.</ref> but such fears were put to an end when George died during his sixth trip to his native Hanover since his accession as king. He suffered a stroke on the road between [[Delden]] and [[Nordhorn]] on 9 June 1727,<ref>Hatton, p. 282</ref> and was taken by carriage to the Prince-Bishop's palace at Osnabr\u00fcck{{efn|His younger brother, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany]], was Prince-Bishop of Osnabr\u00fcck from 1715 until 1728.}} where he died in the early hours before dawn on 11 June 1727.{{efn|22 June in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] [[Gregorian calendar]] adopted by Hanover in 1700.}} George I was buried in the chapel of [[Leineschloss|Leine Palace]] in Hanover, but his remains were moved to the chapel at [[Herrenhausen Gardens]] after World War II.<ref name=\"weir\"/> Leine Palace had burnt out entirely after [[Bombing of Hanover in World War II|British aerial bombings]] and the king's remains, along with his parents', were moved to the 19th-century mausoleum of [[King Ernest Augustus]] in the Berggarten.<ref>Helmut Knocke, Hugo Thielen: ''Mausoleum'' in: ''Hannover. Kunst- und Kultur-Lexikon'', 4. Ed. 2007, p. 92.</ref>\n\nGeorge was succeeded by his son, George Augustus, who took the throne as [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was prevented from doing so by his wife, [[Caroline of Ansbach]]. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability.<ref>Black, pp. 29\u201331, 53, and 61</ref> In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power of the sovereign.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:GeorgeIThornhill.jpg|thumb|George surrounded by his family, in a painting by [[James Thornhill]].]]\n[[File:Georg I.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] indicates such ambivalent feelings as he wrote: {{quote|His heart was in Hanover&nbsp;... He was more than fifty years of age when he came amongst us: we took him because we wanted him, because he served our turn; we laughed at his uncouth German ways, and sneered at him. He took our loyalty for what it was worth; laid hands on what money he could; kept us assuredly from Popery&nbsp;... I, for one, would have been on his side in those days. Cynical and selfish, as he was, he was better than a king out of [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St. Germains]] [James, the Stuart Pretender] with the French king's orders in his pocket, and a swarm of [[Jesuits]] in his train.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thackeray|first=W.

They in turn, influenced British authors of the first half of the twentieth century such as [[G. K. Chesterton]], who introduced further anti-German and anti-Protestant bias into the interpretation of George's reign. However, in the wake of World War II continental European archives were opened to historians of the later twentieth century and nationalistic anti-German feeling subsided. George's life and reign were re-explored by scholars such as Beattie and Hatton, and his character, abilities and motives re-assessed in a more generous light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Hannah|title=Georgian Monarchy: Politics and Culture, 1714\u20131760|year=2006| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-82876-5|pages=3\u20139}}</ref> [[John H.

It was formed in 1932 as '''Alderson\u2013Broaddus College''' by the union of two Baptist institutions: '''Alderson Academy''' (founded 1901) and '''Broaddus Institute''' (founded 1871; moved to Philippi, 1909). The school adopted its current name in 2013.\n\nNoted for its health science, natural science, education and music programs, the school offers a variety of majors in five academic divisions: Education and Special Programs, Health Sciences, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences. It was the first college in West Virginia to offer a four-year degree in nursing and the first in the country to offer a four-year [[physician assistant]] degree.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alderson-Broaddus Early Campus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Campus in the 1930s.|The college's campus in the early 1930s.]]\nAlderson Broaddus University derives its name from the merging of two Baptist institutions in 1932. The older of the two, Broaddus Institute, was founded in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Virginia]], in 1871 by [[Edward Jefferson Willis]], a Baptist minister who named the new school after Rev. [[William Francis Ferguson Broaddus]], a prominent Baptist minister at the time of the [[American Civil War]]. In response to economic hard times, Broaddus Institute was moved across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]], in 1876. The college was moved again to the small town of Philippi in 1909. In 1917 it became Broaddus College and Academy.\n\nThe other institution, [[Alderson Academy]], was founded in [[Alderson, West Virginia]], in 1901 by [[Emma C. Alderson]], a committed Baptist laywoman. Designed as a home school, it provided academic work in [[classics]], sciences and [[Normal school|normal studies]]. Originally supported by the Greenbrier Baptist Church, control was assumed by the [[West Virginia Baptist Association]] in 1910.\n\nAs the years passed, Broaddus became a junior college, then a senior college \u2014 first granting [[baccalaureate degree]]s in 1926 \u2014 and Alderson Academy also added junior college status. Financial hardship in the late 1920s led to a decision to merge the two colleges, which shared common missions and outlooks as Baptist and liberal arts institutions. Since its founding, Alderson Broaddus has been committed to a strong liberal arts education that seeks to imbue students with an appreciation of literature and the arts, Christian faith, music, and the sciences. In more recent times, the college has focused on developing programs in the natural and applied sciences as well. In 1945, Alderson Broaddus developed the first four-year [[nursing]] and the first [[Radiologic technologist|radiologic technology]] programs in West Virginia.\n\nA portion of the physical assets of [[Storer College]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] Baptist college founded 1867 in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], were transferred to Alderson Broaddus in 1964 and became the \u201cStorer Scholarship\u201d given annually to African-American students.\n\nIn 1968, the college pioneered the nation's first four-year [[physician assistant]] (PA) program, an innovation that has had significant influence on the development of the PA profession nationwide. From this program emerged in 1991 the college's first graduate degree offering, the Physician Assistant Master's program.\n\nIn 2011, the college hired Richard Creehan as president. Creehan embarked on a plan to expand the college and the institution has since increased enrollment by over 600 students, expanded the athletic department, and added many new academic programs. In 2013, the college's Board of Governors renamed the institution Alderson Broaddus University.<ref>[http://www.wboy.com/story/22033059/a College renamed to Alderson Broaddus University, affective July 1, 2013]</ref> That same year, the institution matriculated the largest incoming freshman class in school history.\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:Alderson Window.JPG|400px|right|thumb|The '''Alderson Stained Glass Window''' (1910), Burbick Hall, Alderson Broaddus University (Originally: Old Main Building, Alderson Academy and Junior College)]]\nThe university is located on a {{convert|170|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus with approximately 1100 students. The campus occupies a rolling hilltop overlooking the [[Tygart Valley River]] and the community of Philippi, with its county courthouse, church spires and the historic [[Philippi Covered Bridge]], used by both Confederate and Union troops during the first land battle of the Civil War. The campus includes seven residence halls, the old Broaddus Hospital, a student center and cafeteria, an arena that houses the basketball, swimming, wrestling, and acrobatics and tumbling programs, tennis courts, a grass field used for intramural sports, a state of the art stadium that houses the football, lacrosse, and soccer teams, six academic buildings, a library, and a chapel.\n\nThe oldest extant building on the campus, '''[[Whitescarver Hall]]''' (circa 1911), was named for [[George M. Whitescarver]] of [[Pruntytown, West Virginia|Pruntytown, WV]]. The [[Classical Revival]] building was designed by the architectural firm of [[Holmboe and Lafferty]] and was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1990.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\nAB maintains a \"dry campus\" policy (students may not consume alcohol on site).  AB is also home to a big Greek community, with three local fraternities (Sigma Delta Nu, Epsilon Tau Eta Sigma, and Lambda Omega Mu), three local sororities (Lambda Sigma Phi, Phi Kappa Delta, and Zeta Eta Theta), one national sorority ([[Sigma Alpha Iota]]), and one national fraternity ([[Kappa Alpha Psi]]).<ref name=\"ab.edu\">http://ab.edu/student-organizations/</ref>\n\n===Residence life===\nThe campus has seven different dorms for students to live in. All housing options are co-ed.\nThe seven dorms are: Priestley Hall, Benedum Hall, Kincaid Hall, Battler Hall, and Blue, Gold and University (BGU) Halls. Kincaid, Priestley, Blue and Gold Halls are suite style residence halls, complete with bedrooms, bathrooms, and shared living space. Some of these suites have kitchens. Benedum is a true dorm with community bathrooms. Battler and University rooms are two dorm rooms connected by a bathroom. All dorms have a Residence Director and several Residence Assistants.\n\n=== Athletics ===\nKnown as the \"Battlers\" (harkening back to the 1861 [[Battle of Philippi Races|Battle of Philippi]]), Alderson Broaddus is a member of the [[Great Midwest Athletic Conference]] (G-MAC) and [[NCAA Division II]]. The team's colors are Navy Blue, Gray and Gold, and its mascot is named Skirmish. The university offers 24 sports, 22 at the Varsity level: Football (which became a full varsity program in 2013),<ref name=\"Stevens Page 1\">{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.com/Sports/201206240105 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102083014/http://dailymail.com/Sports/201206240105 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=More than meets eye in breakup of WVIAC |first=Rich |last=Stevens |newspaper=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] |location=[[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston, WV]] |page=1 |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 21, 2012 }}</ref> Baseball, Softball, Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and '''[[Alderson\u2013Broaddus Battlers women's soccer|Women's Soccer]]''', Men's and Women's Lacrosse, Men's (club level; to become full varsity in 2015\u201316) and Women's Volleyball, Men's and Women's Cross Country, Men's and Women's Track, Men and Women's Golf, Men and Women's Rugby, Men and Women's Swimming, Men's Wrestling, Women's Acrobatics and Tumbling, Women's Tennis and Cheerleading.\n\nAB and its predecessor institutions had been members of the [[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (WVIAC) since that league's formation in 1924. The WVIAC disbanded at the end of the 2012\u201313 school year, after the nine WVIAC members that then played football announced they would break away to form a new league that eventually became the [[Mountain East Conference]].\n\nShortly after the announcement of the Mountain East split, AB found a new conference home, accepting an invitation to join the G-MAC in the fall of 2013.<ref name=\"G-MAC\">{{cite press release|url=http://g-macsports.com/news/2012/8/21/GEN_0821123920.aspx |title=G-MAC News: Conference Adds Three New Members |publisher=Great Midwest Athletic Conference |date=August 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> AB and three other West Virginia schools\u2014former WVIAC members Davis & Elkins and Ohio Valley, plus independent Salem International\u2014all entered the G-MAC.<ref name=\"G-MAC\"/>\n\nIn 2012 AB started its football program, initially competing at the club level before moving up to Division 2 the following year. Alderson Broaddus originally competed as an independent football team without a conference. In 2016 the G-MAC conference decided to partially make football a competitive sport in the conference with the full competition to start in 2017.The Battlers first defeated Kentucky Wesleyan in the Founders Cup in 2015 to become the first ever G-MAC football Champion. The Battlers became the first G-MAC Conference football champions on 11/12/16 when they defeated Kentucky Wesleyan University 31-28. The G-MAC added another new team to the conference in 2017 of Malone University.\n\nAlderson-Broaddus Baseball won the G-MAC conference title for the first time on May 14, 2016 over Trevecca Nazarene 9-6.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Denise Campbell (politician)|Denise Campbell]], politician and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]]\n* [[Fred Chenoweth]], former [[American football]] coach\n* [[Theodore S.

It was formed in 1932 as '''Alderson\u2013Broaddus College''' by the union of two Baptist institutions: '''Alderson Academy''' (founded 1901) and '''Broaddus Institute''' (founded 1871; moved to Philippi, 1909). The school adopted its current name in 2013.\n\nNoted for its health science, natural science, education and music programs, the school offers a variety of majors in five academic divisions: Education and Special Programs, Health Sciences, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences. It was the first college in West Virginia to offer a four-year degree in nursing and the first in the country to offer a four-year [[physician assistant]] degree.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alderson-Broaddus Early Campus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Campus in the 1930s.|The college's campus in the early 1930s.]]\nAlderson Broaddus University derives its name from the merging of two Baptist institutions in 1932. The older of the two, Broaddus Institute, was founded in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Virginia]], in 1871 by [[Edward Jefferson Willis]], a Baptist minister who named the new school after Rev. [[William Francis Ferguson Broaddus]], a prominent Baptist minister at the time of the [[American Civil War]]. In response to economic hard times, Broaddus Institute was moved across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] to [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]], in 1876. The college was moved again to the small town of Philippi in 1909. In 1917 it became Broaddus College and Academy.\n\nThe other institution, [[Alderson Academy]], was founded in [[Alderson, West Virginia]], in 1901 by [[Emma C. Alderson]], a committed Baptist laywoman. Designed as a home school, it provided academic work in [[classics]], sciences and [[Normal school|normal studies]]. Originally supported by the Greenbrier Baptist Church, control was assumed by the [[West Virginia Baptist Association]] in 1910.\n\nAs the years passed, Broaddus became a junior college, then a senior college \u2014 first granting [[baccalaureate degree]]s in 1926 \u2014 and Alderson Academy also added junior college status. Financial hardship in the late 1920s led to a decision to merge the two colleges, which shared common missions and outlooks as Baptist and liberal arts institutions. Since its founding, Alderson Broaddus has been committed to a strong liberal arts education that seeks to imbue students with an appreciation of literature and the arts, Christian faith, music, and the sciences. In more recent times, the college has focused on developing programs in the natural and applied sciences as well. In 1945, Alderson Broaddus developed the first four-year [[nursing]] and the first [[Radiologic technologist|radiologic technology]] programs in West Virginia.\n\nA portion of the physical assets of [[Storer College]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] Baptist college founded 1867 in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], were transferred to Alderson Broaddus in 1964 and became the \u201cStorer Scholarship\u201d given annually to African-American students.\n\nIn 1968, the college pioneered the nation's first four-year [[physician assistant]] (PA) program, an innovation that has had significant influence on the development of the PA profession nationwide. From this program emerged in 1991 the college's first graduate degree offering, the Physician Assistant Master's program.\n\nIn 2011, the college hired Richard Creehan as president. Creehan embarked on a plan to expand the college and the institution has since increased enrollment by over 600 students, expanded the athletic department, and added many new academic programs. In 2013, the college's Board of Governors renamed the institution Alderson Broaddus University.<ref>[http://www.wboy.com/story/22033059/a College renamed to Alderson Broaddus University, affective July 1, 2013]</ref> That same year, the institution matriculated the largest incoming freshman class in school history.\n\n==Campus==\n[[Image:Alderson Window.JPG|400px|right|thumb|The '''Alderson Stained Glass Window''' (1910), Burbick Hall, Alderson Broaddus University (Originally: Old Main Building, Alderson Academy and Junior College)]]\nThe university is located on a {{convert|170|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus with approximately 1100 students. The campus occupies a rolling hilltop overlooking the [[Tygart Valley River]] and the community of Philippi, with its county courthouse, church spires and the historic [[Philippi Covered Bridge]], used by both Confederate and Union troops during the first land battle of the Civil War. The campus includes seven residence halls, the old Broaddus Hospital, a student center and cafeteria, an arena that houses the basketball, swimming, wrestling, and acrobatics and tumbling programs, tennis courts, a grass field used for intramural sports, a state of the art stadium that houses the football, lacrosse, and soccer teams, six academic buildings, a library, and a chapel.\n\nThe oldest extant building on the campus, '''[[Whitescarver Hall]]''' (circa 1911), was named for [[George M. Whitescarver]] of [[Pruntytown, West Virginia|Pruntytown, WV]]. The [[Classical Revival]] building was designed by the architectural firm of [[Holmboe and Lafferty]] and was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1990.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\nAB maintains a \"dry campus\" policy (students may not consume alcohol on site).  AB is also home to a big Greek community, with three local fraternities (Sigma Delta Nu, Epsilon Tau Eta Sigma, and Lambda Omega Mu), three local sororities (Lambda Sigma Phi, Phi Kappa Delta, and Zeta Eta Theta), one national sorority ([[Sigma Alpha Iota]]), and one national fraternity ([[Kappa Alpha Psi]]).<ref name=\"ab.edu\">http://ab.edu/student-organizations/</ref>\n\n===Residence life===\nThe campus has seven different dorms for students to live in. All housing options are co-ed.\nThe seven dorms are: Priestley Hall, Benedum Hall, Kincaid Hall, Battler Hall, and Blue, Gold and University (BGU) Halls. Kincaid, Priestley, Blue and Gold Halls are suite style residence halls, complete with bedrooms, bathrooms, and shared living space. Some of these suites have kitchens. Benedum is a true dorm with community bathrooms. Battler and University rooms are two dorm rooms connected by a bathroom. All dorms have a Residence Director and several Residence Assistants.\n\n=== Athletics ===\nKnown as the \"Battlers\" (harkening back to the 1861 [[Battle of Philippi Races|Battle of Philippi]]), Alderson Broaddus is a member of the [[Great Midwest Athletic Conference]] (G-MAC) and [[NCAA Division II]]. The teams colors are Navy Blue, Gray and Gold, and its mascot is named Skirmish. The university offers 24 sports, 22 at the Varsity level: Football (which became a full varsity program in 2013),<ref name=\"Stevens Page 1\">{{cite news|url=http://dailymail.com/Sports/201206240105 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102083014/http://dailymail.com/Sports/201206240105 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=More than meets eye in breakup of WVIAC |first=Rich |last=Stevens |newspaper=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] |location=[[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston, WV]] |page=1 |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 21, 2012 }}</ref> Baseball, Softball, Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and '''[[Alderson\u2013Broaddus Battlers women's soccer|Women's Soccer]]''', Men's and Women's Lacrosse, Men's (club level; to become full varsity in 2015\u201316) and Women's Volleyball, Men's and Women's Cross Country, Men's and Women's Track, Men and Women's Golf, Men and Women's Rugby, Men and Women's Swimming, Men's Wrestling, Women's Acrobatics and Tumbling, Women's Tennis and Cheerleading.\n\nAB and its predecessor institutions had been members of the [[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (WVIAC) since that league's formation in 1924. The WVIAC disbanded at the end of the 2012\u201313 school year, after the nine WVIAC members that then played football announced they would break away to form a new league that eventually became the [[Mountain East Conference]].\n\nShortly after the announcement of the Mountain East split, AB found a new conference home, accepting an invitation to join the G-MAC in the fall of 2013.<ref name=\"G-MAC\">{{cite press release|url=http://g-macsports.com/news/2012/8/21/GEN_0821123920.aspx |title=G-MAC News: Conference Adds Three New Members |publisher=Great Midwest Athletic Conference |date=August 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> AB and three other West Virginia schools\u2014former WVIAC members Davis & Elkins and Ohio Valley, plus independent Salem International\u2014all entered the G-MAC.<ref name=\"G-MAC\"/>\n\nIn 2012 AB started its football program, initially competing at the club level before moving up to Division 2 the following year. Alderson Broaddus originally competed as an independent football team without a conference. In 2016 the G-MAC conference decided to partially make football a competitive sport in the conference with the full competition to start in 2017.The Battlers first defeated Kentucky Wesleyan in the Founders Cup in 2015 to become the first ever G-MAC football Champion. The Battlers became the first G-MAC Conference football champions on 11/12/16 when they defeated Kentucky Wesleyan University 31-28. The G-MAC added another new team to the conference in 2017 of Malone University.\n\nAlderson-Broaddus Baseball won the G-MAC conference title for the first time on May 14, 2016 over Trevecca Nazarene 9-6.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Denise Campbell (politician)|Denise Campbell]], politician and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]]\n* [[Fred Chenoweth]], former [[American football]] coach\n* [[Theodore S.
