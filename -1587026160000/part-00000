By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Modifications were made to the building to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned. The Toronto Raptors purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

They employ an enclosed top to prevent the [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid from evaporating, and to conveniently extinguish the flame. Butane lighters have a valved orifice that meters the butane gas as it escapes.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Lighter diagram.PNG|thumb|upright|left|Schematic diagram of a lighter's inside workings]]\nA spark is created by striking metal against a [[Ferrocerium|flint]], or by pressing a button that compresses a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] crystal ([[piezo ignition]]), generating an [[electric arc]]. In naphtha lighters, the liquid is sufficiently volatile, and flammable vapour is present as soon as the top of the lighter is opened. Butane lighters combine the striking action with the opening of the valve to release gas. The spark ignites the flammable gas causing a flame to come out of the lighter which continues until either the top is closed (naphtha type), or the valve is released (butane type).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nA metal enclosure with air holes generally surrounds the flame, and is designed to allow mixing of fuel and air while making the lighter less sensitive to wind. The high energy jet in butane lighters allows mixing to be accomplished by using [[Bernoulli's principle]], so that the air hole(s) in this type tend to be much smaller and farther from the flame.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nSpecialized \"windproof\" butane lighters are manufactured for demanding conditions such as shipboard, high altitude, and wet climates. Some dedicated models double as synthetic rope cutters. Such lighters are often far hotter than normal lighters (those that use a \"soft flame\") and can burn in excess of {{convert|1100|C}}. The windproof capabilities are not achieved from higher pressure fuel; windproof lighters use the same fuel (butane) as standard lighters, and therefore develop the same vapour pressure. Instead, windproof lighters [[Bunsen Burner#Operation|mix the fuel with air]] and pass the butane\u2013air mixture through a catalytic coil. An electric spark starts the initial flame, and soon the coil is hot enough to cause the fuel\u2013air mixture to burn on contact.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Other types==\n\n=== Jet lighter ===\nAs opposed to lighters of the naphtha or standard butane type (whether refillable or disposable), which combust incompletely and thus create a sooty, orange \"safety\" flame, jet lighters produce a blue flame that in some cases is almost invisible and invariably burns at a far higher temperature.  The spark in such lighters is almost always produced by an electric arc (as seen below), but some jet lighters burn with incomplete combustion.\n\nDisadvantages to the jet lighter include a \"roaring\" noise in operation, as well as higher fuel consumption.\n\n=== Electric arc lighter ===\nArc lighters use a spark to create a plasma<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futurelighter.co/ |author=Farok Verra |title=Future Lighter |date=2020 |publisher=futurelighter.co |accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref>  conduit between electrodes, which is then maintained by a lower voltage. The arc is then applied to a flammable substance to cause ignition.\n\n=== Automobile lighter ===\n{{see also|Cigarette lighter receptacle}}\n\nSome vehicles are equipped with an electric lighter located on the dashboard or in the well between the front seats. Its electric heating element becomes hot in seconds upon activation. The car lighter was claimed to have been invented by Alexander Kucala, a tavern owner and inventor, on the south side of Chicago in the early 1930s called the AL Lighter.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Match lighter ===\n[[Image:Mechero.JPG|thumb|Traditional Spanish match lighters.]]\n\nNot to be confused with the meaning of ''match'' as in [[matchsticks]] or the \"permanent match\" (see below), this type of lighter consists of a length of ''[[slow match]]'' in a holder, with means to ignite and to extinguish the match.\nWhile the glowing match does not generally supply enough energy to start a fire without further [[Firelighting|kindling]], it is fully sufficient to light a cigarette. The main advantage of this design shows itself in windy conditions, where the glow of the match is fanned by the wind instead of being blown out.\n\n=== Permanent match ===\n[[File:Open permanent match.jpg|thumb|left|A permanent match lighter with the metal 'match' leaning against the shell]]\n\nA typical form of lighter is the ''permanent match'' or ''everlasting match'', consisting of a naphtha fuel-filled metal shell and a separate threaded metal rod assembly \u2014the \"match\"\u2014 serving as the striker and wick. This \"metal match\" is stored screwed into the fuel storage compartment: the shell.\n\nThe fuel-saturated striker/wick assembly is unscrewed to remove, and scratched against a flint on the side of the case to create a spark. Its concealed wick catches fire, resembling a [[match]]. The flame is extinguished by blowing it out before screwing the \"match\" back into the shell, where it absorbs fuel for the next use. An advantage over other naphtha lighters is that the fuel compartment is sealed shut with a rubber [[o-ring]], which slows or stops fuel evaporation.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Flameless lighter ===\n\nA ''flameless lighter'' is a safe alternative to traditional lighters. The ''flameless lighter'' uses an enclosed heating element which glows, so that the device does not produce an open flame.  Typical flameless heating elements are an electrically heated wire or an artificial coal.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nFlameless lighters are designed for use in any environment where an open flame, conventional lighters or matches are not permitted. The flameless lighter is used in many environments such as prisons and detention facilities, oil and gas facilities, mental health facilities, nursing homes, airports and night clubs/restaurants.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nMany advertised so-called flameless lighters are not flameless at all, but the flame is invisible (such as a windproof lighter). If a piece of paper can easily be ignited, it is probably not a true flameless lighter and may not be safe in hazardous environments where smoking is confined to specific safe areas.\n\nThe flameless lighter was invented by brothers Douglas Hammond and David Hammond in the UK in 1966 under the \"Ciglow\" name.<ref name=\"Ciglow website\">{{cite web|title=About Ciglow|url=http://www.ciglow.co.uk/|website=Ciglow.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Catalytic lighter ===\n\nCatalytic lighters use methanol or methylated spirits as fuel and a thin platinum wire which heats up in the presence of flammable vapours and produces a flame.<ref>{{cite web|author=Frank Dutton |url=http://www.toledo-bend.com/VCL/articles/index.asp?request=catalytic |title=Making Catalytic Lighters Work |publisher=Toledo-bend.com |accessdate=2015-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916230432/http://www.toledo-bend.com/VCL/articles/index.asp?request=catalytic |archivedate=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nlighters: the International Standard EN ISO 9994:2002<ref>{{Cite book | editor-last = ISO | title = Safety specification | work = Lighters | year = 2005 | page = 32 | place = Geneva | publisher = ISO | url = http://www.bicworld.com/inter_en/safety/pdf/03_norme_ISO_9994.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060312152447/http://www.bicworld.com/inter_en/safety/pdf/03_norme_ISO_9994.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2006-03-12 | id = ISO 9994:2005(E) }}</ref> and the European standard EN 13869:2002.<ref name=\"13869:2002\">{{Cite book | editor-last = The European Committee for Standardization | title = Child-resistance for lighters&nbsp;\u2014 Safety requirements and test methods | work = Lighters | year = 2002 | place = Brussels | publisher = CEN | id = EN 13869:2002 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe International Standard establishes non-functional specifications on quality, reliability and safety of lighters and appropriate test procedures.

However, the standard does not include child resistance specifications.\n\nThe European standard EN 13869:2002<ref name=\"13869:2002\" /> establishes child-resistance specifications and defines as novelty lighters those that resemble another object commonly recognized as appealing to children younger than 51 months, or those that have entertaining audio or animated effects.\n\nAs [[matches]], lighters, and other heat sources are the leading causes of fire deaths for children,<ref>{{cite web|title=Match and Lighter Safety |url=http://www.usfaparents.gov/matches/ |author=US Fire Administration |date=2008-03-12 |publisher=FEMA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306085136/http://www.usfaparents.gov/matches/ |archivedate= 6 March 2008}}</ref> many jurisdictions, such as the EU,<ref>{{cite web |author=European Commission |title=2006/502/EC: Commission Decision of 11 May 2006 requiring Member States to take measures to ensure that only lighters which are child-resistant are placed on the market and to prohibit the placing on the market of novelty lighters |year=2006 |pages=41\u201345 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006D0502:EN:NOT |id=OJ L 198, 20.7.2006 |postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> have prohibited the marketing of novelty or non-child resistant lighters. Examples of child resistance features include the use of a smooth or shielded spark wheel.

They employ an enclosed top to prevent the [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid from evaporating, and to conveniently extinguish the flame. Butane lighters have a valved orifice that meters the butane gas as it escapes.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Lighter diagram.PNG|thumb|upright|left|Schematic diagram of a lighter's inside workings]]\nA spark is created by striking metal against a [[Ferrocerium|flint]], or by pressing a button that compresses a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] crystal ([[piezo ignition]]), generating an [[electric arc]]. In naphtha lighters, the liquid is sufficiently volatile, and flammable vapour is present as soon as the top of the lighter is opened. Butane lighters combine the striking action with the opening of the valve to release gas. The spark ignites the flammable gas causing a flame to come out of the lighter which continues until either the top is closed (naphtha type), or the valve is released (butane type).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nA metal enclosure with air holes generally surrounds the flame, and is designed to allow mixing of fuel and air while making the lighter less sensitive to wind. The high energy jet in butane lighters allows mixing to be accomplished by using [[Bernoulli's principle]], so that the air hole(s) in this type tend to be much smaller and farther from the flame.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nSpecialized \"windproof\" butane lighters are manufactured for demanding conditions such as shipboard, high altitude, and wet climates. Some dedicated models double as synthetic rope cutters. Such lighters are often far hotter than normal lighters (those that use a \"soft flame\") and can burn in excess of {{convert|1100|C}}. The windproof capabilities are not achieved from higher pressure fuel; windproof lighters use the same fuel (butane) as standard lighters, and therefore develop the same vapour pressure. Instead, windproof lighters [[Bunsen Burner#Operation|mix the fuel with air]] and pass the butane\u2013air mixture through a catalytic coil. An electric spark starts the initial flame, and soon the coil is hot enough to cause the fuel\u2013air mixture to burn on contact.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Other types==\n\n=== Jet lighter ===\nAs opposed to lighters of the naphtha or standard butane type (whether refillable or disposable), which combust incompletely and thus create a sooty, orange \"safety\" flame, jet lighters produce a blue flame that in some cases is almost invisible and invariably burns at a far higher temperature.  The spark in such lighters is almost always produced by an electric arc (as seen below), but some jet lighters burn with incomplete combustion.\n\nDisadvantages to the jet lighter include a \"roaring\" noise in operation, as well as higher fuel consumption.\n\n=== Electric arc lighter ===\nArc lighters use a spark to create a plasma<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futurelighter.co/ |author=Farok Verra |title=Future Lighter |date=2020 |publisher=futurelighter.co |accessdate=2020-03-10}}</ref>  conduit between electrodes, which is then maintained by a lower voltage. The arc is then applied to a flammable substance to cause ignition.\n\n=== Automobile lighter ===\n{{see also|Cigarette lighter receptacle}}\n\nSome vehicles are equipped with an electric lighter located on the dashboard or in the well between the front seats. Its electric heating element becomes hot in seconds upon activation. The car lighter was claimed to have been invented by Alexander Kucala, a tavern owner and inventor, on the south side of Chicago in the early 1930s called the AL Lighter.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Match lighter ===\n[[Image:Mechero.JPG|thumb|Traditional Spanish match lighters.]]\n\nNot to be confused with the meaning of ''match'' as in [[matchsticks]] or the \"permanent match\" (see below), this type of lighter consists of a length of ''[[slow match]]'' in a holder, with means to ignite and to extinguish the match.\nWhile the glowing match does not generally supply enough energy to start a fire without further [[Firelighting|kindling]], it is fully sufficient to light a cigarette. The main advantage of this design shows itself in windy conditions, where the glow of the match is fanned by the wind instead of being blown out.\n\n=== Permanent match ===\n[[File:Open permanent match.jpg|thumb|left|A permanent match lighter with the metal 'match' leaning against the shell]]\n\nA typical form of lighter is the ''permanent match'' or ''everlasting match'', consisting of a naphtha fuel-filled metal shell and a separate threaded metal rod assembly \u2014the \"match\"\u2014 serving as the striker and wick. This \"metal match\" is stored screwed into the fuel storage compartment, the shell.\n\nThe fuel-saturated striker/wick assembly is unscrewed to remove, and scratched against a flint on the side of the case to create a spark. Its concealed wick catches fire, resembling a [[match]]. The flame is extinguished by blowing it out before screwing the \"match\" back into the shell, where it absorbs fuel for the next use. An advantage over other naphtha lighters is that the fuel compartment is sealed shut with a rubber [[o-ring]], which slows or stops fuel evaporation.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Flameless lighter ===\n\nA ''flameless lighter'' is a safe alternative to traditional lighters. The ''flameless lighter'' uses an enclosed heating element which glows, so that the device does not produce an open flame.  Typical flameless heating elements are an electrically heated wire or an artificial coal.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nFlameless lighters are designed for use in any environment where an open flame, conventional lighters or matches are not permitted. The flameless lighter is used in many environments such as prisons and detention facilities, oil and gas facilities, mental health facilities, nursing homes, airports and night clubs/restaurants.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nMany advertised so-called flameless lighters are not flameless at all, but the flame is invisible (such as a windproof lighter). If a piece of paper can easily be ignited, it is probably not a true flameless lighter and may not be safe in hazardous environments where smoking is confined to specific safe areas.\n\nThe flameless lighter was invented by brothers Douglas Hammond and David Hammond in the UK in 1966 under the \"Ciglow\" name.<ref name=\"Ciglow website\">{{cite web|title=About Ciglow|url=http://www.ciglow.co.uk/|website=Ciglow.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Catalytic lighter ===\n\nCatalytic lighters use methanol or methylated spirits as fuel and a thin platinum wire which heats up in the presence of flammable vapours and produces a flame.<ref>{{cite web|author=Frank Dutton |url=http://www.toledo-bend.com/VCL/articles/index.asp?request=catalytic |title=Making Catalytic Lighters Work |publisher=Toledo-bend.com |accessdate=2015-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916230432/http://www.toledo-bend.com/VCL/articles/index.asp?request=catalytic |archivedate=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nlighters: the International Standard EN ISO 9994:2002<ref>{{Cite book | editor-last = ISO | title = Safety specification | work = Lighters | year = 2005 | page = 32 | place = Geneva | publisher = ISO | url = http://www.bicworld.com/inter_en/safety/pdf/03_norme_ISO_9994.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060312152447/http://www.bicworld.com/inter_en/safety/pdf/03_norme_ISO_9994.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2006-03-12 | id = ISO 9994:2005(E) }}</ref> and the European standard EN 13869:2002.<ref name=\"13869:2002\">{{Cite book | editor-last = The European Committee for Standardization | title = Child-resistance for lighters&nbsp;\u2014 Safety requirements and test methods | work = Lighters | year = 2002 | place = Brussels | publisher = CEN | id = EN 13869:2002 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe International Standard establishes non-functional specifications on quality, reliability and safety of lighters and appropriate test procedures. For instance, a lighter should generate flame only through positive action on the part of the user, two or more independent actions by the user, or an actuating force greater than or equal to 15 Newton. The standard also specifies other safety features, such as the lighter's maximum flame height and its resistance to elevated temperatures, dropping, and damages from continuous burning. However, the standard does not include child resistance specifications.\n\nThe European standard EN 13869:2002<ref name=\"13869:2002\" /> establishes child-resistance specifications and defines as novelty lighters those that resemble another object commonly recognized as appealing to children younger than 51 months, or those that have entertaining audio or animated effects.\n\nAs [[matches]], lighters, and other heat sources are the leading causes of fire deaths for children,<ref>{{cite web|title=Match and Lighter Safety |url=http://www.usfaparents.gov/matches/ |author=US Fire Administration |date=2008-03-12 |publisher=FEMA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306085136/http://www.usfaparents.gov/matches/ |archivedate= 6 March 2008}}</ref> many jurisdictions, such as the EU,<ref>{{cite web |author=European Commission |title=2006/502/EC: Commission Decision of 11 May 2006 requiring Member States to take measures to ensure that only lighters which are child-resistant are placed on the market and to prohibit the placing on the market of novelty lighters |year=2006 |pages=41\u201345 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006D0502:EN:NOT |id=OJ L 198, 20.7.2006 |postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> have prohibited the marketing of novelty or non-child resistant lighters. Examples of child resistance features include the use of a smooth or shielded spark wheel. Many people remove the child proofing from lighters by prying off the metal with scissors or keys, making the lighter easier to ignite.\n\nIn 2005 the fourth edition of the ISO standard was released (ISO9994:2005). The main change to the 2004 Standard is the inclusion of specifications on safety symbols.\n\n==\"Greatest gadget\"==\nIn August 2011 [[Stephen Fry]] chose the lighter as the greatest [[gadget]] in his [[Channel 4]] programme ''Stephen Fry's 100 Greatest Gadgets'', one of the ''[[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest]]'' strand, describing it as \"fire with a flick of the fingers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen Fry's 100 Greatest Gadgets: The list |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/stephen-frys-100-greatest-gadgets/articles/the-list |work=Channel 4 |accessdate=2 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205021713/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/stephen-frys-100-greatest-gadgets/articles/the-list |archivedate=5 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Butane torch]]\n* [[Car adaptor]]\n* [[Clipper (lighter)]]\n* [[Ferrocerium]]\n* [[Gas lighter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons-inline|Lighter}}\n*{{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Home appliances}}\n{{Cigarettes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lighters (firelighting)| ]]\n[[Category:Firelighting]]\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n[[Category:Butane]]\n[[Category:1823 introductions]]\n[[Category:19th-century inventions]]\n[[Category:German inventions]]\n", "name_user": "Daizehnd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePermanent match:grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter"}

[[Intermodal container|flat rack containers]] can accommodate over height, over width or over weight cargo.

Also out of gauge for most ships are containers between 45' and 53' long used in some countries for domestic rail and truck transport.

[[Intermodal container|flat rack containers]] can accommodate over height, over width or over weight cargo.

Also out of gauge for most ships are containers between 45' and 53' long used in some countries for domestic rail and truck transport.

Today it hangs in the [[Pasqualati House]] of the [[Vienna Museum]].\n\n== Background ==\nJoseph Willibrord M\u00e4hler was introduced to Beethoven by {{Interlanguage link multi|Stephan von Breuning (writer)|de|3=Stephan von Breuning (Librettist)|lt=Stephan von Breuning}} (1774\u20131827). Though eventually a court secretary, M\u00e4hler was interested in music, was a good singer and did some composing. Beethoven took him to one rehearsal of ''[[Fidelio|Leonore]]'' in 1805.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=58}}\n\nWhat is known about the painting stems from [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]]'s biography. He first came across the original M\u00e4hler painting during a research visit (for his Beethoven biography) to Caroline Barbara van Beethoven (born Naske), the widow of Karl Beethoven, the composer's nephew. Because [[Thayer's copy|Thayer owned a copy]], he was particularly interested in learning about the circumstances under which it was painted. He considered this painting the most interesting and engaging of the portraits he had encountered.{{sfn|Bellofatto|2006|p=13}} He later interviewed Joseph Willibrord M\u00e4hler on May 24, 1860.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=336}}{{sfn|Bellofatto|2006|p=13}} Thayer characterized the friendship between Beethoven and M\u00e4hler as one where composer's kindness was returned by M\u00e4hler with warm affection and admiration for composer's genius.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=336}} In offering recollections of Beethoven, M\u00e4hler spoke of his 1804 portrait and wondered where it was. To his question, Thayer responded that it belonged to the widow of Karl Beethoven. M\u00e4hler then revealed that he had a copy of it.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}}\n\nM\u00e4hler painted four portraits of Beethoven.  Only the first image, dated by Thayer at 1804\u201305, contains a nearly full view of the composer.  Beethoven apparently liked this portrait very much and owned it until his death.<ref>[http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=15288&template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&_dokid=i1352&_seite=6-1 \"Willibrord Joseph M\u00e4hler (1778\u20131860), Ludwig van Beethoven, 1804 \u2013 Fotografie von Rudolf Stepanek nach dem Gem\u00e4lde von Willibrord Joseph M\u00e4hler\"], Digital Archives [[Beethoven House]] Bonn.</ref>\n\nThere are only three references to this portrait in contemporary Beethoven sources:\n#In Beethoven's [[Nachlass]] there was an undated note to M\u00e4hler: \"I beg of you to return my portrait to me as soon as you have made sufficient use of it\u2014if you need it longer I beg of you at least to make haste\u2014I have promised the portrait to a stranger, a lady who saw it here, that she may hang it in her room during her stay of several weeks.

The portrait of Beethoven\u2019s grandfather was prominently displayed in the entry hall, while the M\u00e4hler portrait was on the back wall of a storage room where visitors were never admitted.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=61}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\nIn an extended article, Owen Jander discusses the symbolism embedded within Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth symphony]] and the portrait, hypothesizing that both works were a \"ritualized confrontation\" \u2013 a public yet veiled declaration of the composer's growing [[deafness]], as a means of learning to accept it.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=44}} Jander proposes that much of 18th to 19th century [[portrait painting]] can be considered self-portraits, commissioned at significant times in a person's life in which the details of the portrait were laid out by the subject.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=45}} Elements such as the subject's pose, facial expression, clothing, accompanying objects and gestures are all part of the conventions of portraiture.  Similarly, if any of these elements is depicted in such a way that diverges from typical depictions, that strengthens the message they intend to communicate by drawing in the viewer's attention.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=46}} Contrasting gestures between right and left arm are typical and serve to sensitize the viewer to summon interpretation,{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=48}} or in the words of critic Philip Conisbee, a \"narrative portrait with a didactic purpose.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=49}}\n\nJander theorizes that an inspiration for M\u00e4hler's portrait is Leopold Radoux's 1773 portrait of Beethoven's grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773), which the composer had prominently displayed in his apartment.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}} Notably, one of the features of this portrait (painted the same year as the subject's death) was a cape falling off the back of the subject.  To Jander, this represents the overcoming of grief that befell Beethoven's grandfather upon the death of his wife from alcoholism while maintaining a family life (his son [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]]\u2014the younger Ludwig van Beethoven's father\u2014also suffered and eventually died from alcoholism). To understand the possible effect upon the composer, Jander cites 18th century mathematician and art theorist [[Johann Georg Sulzer]] who in his ''Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste'' provided an understanding on how an ancestor's portrait can have a healing effect on descendants.  \"The bonds of admiration and love between us and our ancestors are maintained and thus have a healing influence on the spirit, as though occasionally the deceased were still sitting among us\u2026.a portrait can make almost as powerful an impression upon us humans as can the person himself.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}}\n\n=== The plant ===\n\nJander notes that plant studies were part of the curriculum of the Dresden Art Academy where M\u00e4hler attended, so it is natural to expect plants in his graphic work. The plant at the bottom left of the portrait Jander identified as ''[[Polygonum bistorta]]'', commonly known as knotweed.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} The nature of this plant is of [[inflorescence]] (a cluster of flowers on a branch).  In the portrait there are groups of knotweed shown in various stages, from initial blossoming with pink to mature florets with the color receded. (Jander charactizes Beethoven as \"nature-loving\" and recalls the [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] where the composer wrote \"as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered\u2026,\" an allusion very similar to the one depicted in the portrait.){{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} Jander proposes that the fading color of the plant is a metaphor to the composer's loss of hearing.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=64}}\n\n=== The lyre-guitar ===\n\nThough M\u00e4hler described the instrument as a [[lyre]],{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Jander identified it specifically as a [[lyre-guitar]], an instrument popular in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=65}}  The interpretation is that, with his hand holding the instrument, Beethoven draws forth music. But lyre-guitars normally have six strings, while the one Beethoven is holding has only five.

Today it hangs in the [[Pasqualati House]] of the [[Vienna Museum]].\n\n== Background ==\nJoseph Willibrord M\u00e4hler was introduced to Beethoven by {{Interlanguage link multi|Stephan von Breuning (writer)|de|3=Stephan von Breuning (Librettist)|lt=Stephan von Breuning}} (1774\u20131827). Though eventually a court secretary, M\u00e4hler was interested in music, was a good singer and did some composing. Beethoven took him to one rehearsal of ''[[Fidelio|Leonore]]'' in 1805.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=58}}\n\nWhat is known about the painting stems from [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]]'s biography. He first came across the original M\u00e4hler painting during a research visit (for his Beethoven biography) to Caroline Barbara van Beethoven (born Naske), the widow of Karl Beethoven, the composer's nephew. Because [[Thayer's copy|Thayer owned a copy]], he was particularly interested in learning about the circumstances under which it was painted. He considered this painting the most interesting and engaging of the portraits he had encountered.{{sfn|Bellofatto|2006|p=13}} He later interviewed Joseph Willibrord M\u00e4hler on May 24, 1860.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=336}}{{sfn|Bellofatto|2006|p=13}} Thayer characterized the friendship between Beethoven and M\u00e4hler as one where composer's kindness was returned by M\u00e4hler with warm affection and admiration for composer's genius.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=336}} In offering recollections of Beethoven, M\u00e4hler spoke of his 1804 portrait and wondered where it was. To his question, Thayer responded that it belonged to the widow of Karl Beethoven. M\u00e4hler then revealed that he had a copy of it.{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}}\n\nM\u00e4hler painted four portraits of Beethoven.  Only the first image, dated by Thayer at 1804\u201305, contains a nearly full view of the composer.  Beethoven apparently liked this portrait very much and owned it until his death.<ref>[http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=15288&template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&_dokid=i1352&_seite=6-1 \"Willibrord Joseph M\u00e4hler (1778\u20131860), Ludwig van Beethoven, 1804 \u2013 Fotografie von Rudolf Stepanek nach dem Gem\u00e4lde von Willibrord Joseph M\u00e4hler\"], Digital Archives [[Beethoven House]] Bonn.</ref>\n\nThere are only three references to this portrait in contemporary Beethoven sources:\n#In Beethoven's [[Nachlass]] there was an undated note to M\u00e4hler: \"I beg of you to return my portrait to me as soon as you have made sufficient use of it\u2014if you need it longer I beg of you at least to make haste\u2014I have promised the portrait to a stranger, a lady who saw it here, that she may hang it in her room during her stay of several weeks.

The portrait of Beethoven\u2019s grandfather was prominently displayed in the entry hall, while the M\u00e4hler portrait was on the back wall of a storage room where visitors were never admitted.{{sfn|Jander|2008|61}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\nIn an extended article, Owen Jander discusses the symbolism embedded within Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth symphony]] and the portrait, hypothesizing that both works were a \"ritualized confrontation\" \u2013 a public yet veiled declaration of the composer's growing [[deafness]], as a means of learning to accept it.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=44}} Jander proposes that much of 18th to 19th century [[portrait painting]] can be considered self-portraits, commissioned at significant times in a person's life in which the details of the portrait were laid out by the subject.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=45}} Elements such as the subject's pose, facial expression, clothing, accompanying objects and gestures are all part of the conventions of portraiture.  Similarly, if any of these elements is depicted in such a way that diverges from typical depictions, that strengthens the message they intend to communicate by drawing in the viewer's attention.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=46}} Contrasting gestures between right and left arm are typical and serve to sensitize the viewer to summon interpretation,{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=48}} or in the words of critic Philip Conisbee, a \"narrative portrait with a didactic purpose.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=49}}\n\nJander theorizes that an inspiration for M\u00e4hler's portrait is Leopold Radoux's 1773 portrait of Beethoven's grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773), which the composer had prominently displayed in his apartment.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}} Notably, one of the features of this portrait (painted the same year as the subject's death) was a cape falling off the back of the subject.  To Jander, this represents the overcoming of grief that befell Beethoven's grandfather upon the death of his wife from alcoholism while maintaining a family life (his son [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]]\u2014the younger Ludwig van Beethoven's father\u2014also suffered and eventually died from alcoholism). To understand the possible effect upon the composer, Jander cites 18th century mathematician and art theorist [[Johann Georg Sulzer]] who in his ''Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste'' provided an understanding on how an ancestor's portrait can have a healing effect on descendants.  \"The bonds of admiration and love between us and our ancestors are maintained and thus have a healing influence on the spirit, as though occasionally the deceased were still sitting among us\u2026.a portrait can make almost as powerful an impression upon us humans as can the person himself.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=57}}\n\n=== The plant ===\n\nJander notes that plant studies were part of the curriculum of the Dresden Art Academy where M\u00e4hler attended, so it is natural to expect plants in his graphic work. The plant at the bottom left of the portrait Jander identified as ''[[Polygonum bistorta]]'', commonly known as knotweed.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} The nature of this plant is of [[inflorescence]] (a cluster of flowers on a branch).  In the portrait there are groups of knotweed shown in various stages, from initial blossoming with pink to mature florets with the color receded. (Jander charactizes Beethoven as \"nature-loving\" and recalls the [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] where the composer wrote \"as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered\u2026,\" an allusion very similar to the one depicted in the portrait.){{sfn|Jander|2008|p=63}} Jander proposes that the fading color of the plant is a metaphor to the composer's loss of hearing.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=64}}\n\n=== The lyre-guitar ===\n\nThough M\u00e4hler described the instrument as a [[lyre]],{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Jander identified it specifically as a [[lyre-guitar]], an instrument popular in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=65}}  The interpretation is that, with his hand holding the instrument, Beethoven draws forth music. But lyre-guitars normally have six strings, while the one Beethoven is holding has only five.  With the pegs of the strings arranged in two rows, Jander identified the missing string as being one of the higher-pitched strings, suggesting a visual metaphor for Beethoven's inability to hear high frequencies.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The cape ===\n\nJander quotes Sulzer who described the arrangement of clothing in graphic art could depict \"a soul agitated through passion.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}  Below Beethoven's back there is a dark blue cape which has fallen from his shoulders.  Most of the cape lies in a heap in the lower right hand corner of the picture, which \"intensifies the message of divestment.\"{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}} In part this is a reference to the painting of the composer's grandfather, whose falling cape represented the overcoming of grief.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=67}}\n\n=== The right hand ===\n\nSulzer (as quoted by Jander) said that gestures should never cause so much attention as to distract the viewer away from the face.{{sfn|Jander|2008|p=68}} The enigmatic nature of the depiction of Beethoven's right hand appears to have puzzled both Thayer and Jander.  Thayer recalled M\u00e4hler offering a description: \"...the right hand is extended, as if, in a moment of musical enthusiasm, he was beating time...\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337}} Thayer provided his own thoughts:{{sfn|Thayer|1967|p=337\u2013338}}\n\n{{quote|The extended right hand\u2014though, like the rest of the picture, not very artistically executed\u2014was evidently painted with care.

The notion of [[Goa Special Status|Goan identity]] as a distinct culture among other [[Luso-Asians]] or [[Luso-Indian]] cultures was forged into [[India]] after the [[annexation of Goa]] in 1961. However, contemporary Goan Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture and is widely seen as distinct, both in India and the rest of the world. \n\nThe Goan Catholic diaspora is concentrated in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], the [[Lusophone]] world, especially [[Portugal]], and the [[Anglophone]] world, especially the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"North Atlantic Pp.165-183\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Pereira\n | first = Clifford\n | editor1-last = German\n | editor1-first = Myna\n | editor2-last = Banerjee\n | editor2-first = Padmini\n | date = 2011\n | title = Migration, Technology, and Transculturation: A Global Perspective\n | location =\n | publisher =\n | chapter = Goans of the North Atlantic: A Transnational study of Migration, Technology Adoption, and Neoculturation across Six Generations\n | pp = 165\u2013183\n | isbn = 978-0-9846307-4-5\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Ethnic identity ==\nChristian adherents to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] who originate from the present state of [[Goa]], a region on the west coast of [[India]], and their descendants are generally referred to as Goan Catholics.

Many pre-Portuguese Hindu traditions were adapted or retained by the Goan Catholics. This often includes the [[Indian caste system]] although it is not widely practiced. Throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]] a large part of civic administration (e.g. registration of births, marriages and deaths, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.) was initially maintained by the religious orders. Under [[Portuguese nationality law]], Goans born before 1961 in the then Portuguese territory of Goa are entitled to Portuguese citizenship. As per the law of Portugal this is extended up to two generations, that is to their children and grandchildren.<ref name=\"jac\">{{harvnb|Jacobsen|Raj|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6L5MxlMIcG0C&printsec=frontcover#PPA23,M1 23]|Ref=jacob}}</ref> All naturalised citizens from Goa receive their [[Jus sanguinis|citizenship through descent]] (''Jus sanguinis'') from their parents or grandparents who were once Portuguese subjects.

The British saw them as Portuguese citizens and favoured them in administration due to their ease in the use of English and predominantly Western culture. At that time [[History of Bombay under British rule (1661\u20131947)|Bombay was under the British rule]] and there existed another established Luso-Indian Catholic community; the [[East Indians]], who were former residents of Portuguese Bombay prior to being granted to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] in the seventeenth century.

Hence, many aspects of their social and religious life are deeply enshrined in their exquisite western heritage. For instance, they celebrate [[Carnival]] (western practice) before [[Lent]] and their religious scripture is only [[Konkani in the Roman script|Konkani written and conducted]] in the [[Roman script]]. Even their Konkani dialect takes a lot from Portuguese in terms of syntax or loan words.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Goan Catholics}}\n\n===Pre-Portuguese era===\nPre-colonial Goan history includes Hindu, Buddhists and Islamic religious phases.

He speaks of Goa as a trading centre with the Middle East and with Rome). He suggests that the Apostle Thomas might have made his way over land from northern India to Kerala. He also examines the evidence of the Apostle Bartholomew having done more or less the same thing. Ch. 6 is dedicated to the examination of Pre-Portuguese references to Christianity in Goa. Ch. 7 examines the vestiges of Pre-Portuguese Christian Customs in Goa and the Konkan. Ch. 8 concludes the book with the \"latest archaeological discovery\": a \"Thomas Cross\" hidden in a smallish monument, surmounted by a Latin Cross, near the old Goa harbor. The Thomas Cross bears an inscription in Pahlavi, which, Costa reports, was the liturgical language of the church associated with the Metropolitan of Fars.<ref>Costa 35.

This unsuccessful action was the first open revolt against the Portuguese from within Goa. Britain gained control of Goa twice, the first time in 1797\u20131798 and the second time from 1802 to 1813. In 1843 the capital was moved to [[Panaji|Panjim]] and by the mid 18th century the area under occupation by the Portuguese expanded to Goa's present-day limits.\n\nIn 1900 there were 262,648 Goan Catholics in Goa and 200,144 Hindus.<ref name=\"i15\">{{harvnb|The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 12||p=[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V12_264.gif 258]|Ref=imp}}</ref>\n\nBy 1921 it was estimated that 200,000 out of 670,000 Goans, mostly Christian, resided outside Goa.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania|author1=Ring, T.|author2=Salkin, R.M.|author3=Boda, S.L.|date=1996|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|isbn=9781884964046|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWLRxJEU49EC|page=289}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1928 the Diocese of Goa was renamed and was promoted to the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Goa and Daman]] (''Goa e Dam\u00e3o'').

The Metropolitan Archbishop of Goa and Daman also uses the title of Primate of the Indies or [[Primate of the East]] and honorifically receives the title of [[Patriarch of the East Indies]].\n\nBy this time the Portuguese Empire had started declining and further resistance to their occupation in Goa started gaining momentum.

They are  [[Konkani people]] and speak the [[Konkani language]].\n\nSeafarers from [[Portugal]] arrived in Goa in 1510 CE, and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Christianization of Goa|missionary activities]] soon followed, as [[Pope Nicholas V]] had enacted the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' in 1455 CE which granted the patronage of the [[Evangelization|propagation]] of the [[Christianity|Christian faith]] in [[Asia]] to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].\n\nTheir culture is an amalgam of [[Culture of India|Indian]]-[[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese]]-[[Religion in Portugal|Christian]] cultures, with the latter having a more dominant role as Goa had been an overseas colony of Portugal from 1510\u20131961. The notion of [[Goa Special Status|Goan identity]] as a distinct culture among other [[Luso-Asians]] or [[Luso-Indian]] cultures was forged into [[India]] after the [[annexation of Goa]] in 1961. However, contemporary Goan Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture and is widely seen as distinct, both in India and the rest of the world. \n\nThe Goan Catholic diaspora is concentrated in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], the [[Lusophone]] world, especially [[Portugal]], and the [[Anglophone]] world, especially the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref name=\"North Atlantic Pp.165-183\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Pereira\n | first = Clifford\n | editor1-last = German\n | editor1-first = Myna\n | editor2-last = Banerjee\n | editor2-first = Padmini\n | date = 2011\n | title = Migration, Technology, and Transculturation: A Global Perspective\n | location =\n | publisher =\n | chapter = Goans of the North Atlantic: A Transnational study of Migration, Technology Adoption, and Neoculturation across Six Generations\n | pp = 165\u2013183\n | isbn = 978-0-9846307-4-5\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Ethnic identity ==\nChristian adherents to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] who originate from the present state of [[Goa]], a region on the west coast of [[India]], and their descendants are generally referred to as Goan Catholics.

Many pre-Portuguese Hindu traditions were adapted or retained by the Goan Catholics. This often includes the [[Indian caste system]] although it is not widely practiced. Throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]] a large part of civic administration (e.g. registration of births, marriages and deaths, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.) was initially maintained by the religious orders. Under [[Portuguese nationality law]], Goans born before 1961 in the then Portuguese territory of Goa are entitled to Portuguese citizenship. As per the law of Portugal this is extended up to two generations, that is to their children and grandchildren.<ref name=\"jac\">{{harvnb|Jacobsen|Raj|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6L5MxlMIcG0C&printsec=frontcover#PPA23,M1 23]|Ref=jacob}}</ref> All naturalised citizens from Goa receive their [[Jus sanguinis|citizenship through descent]] (''Jus sanguinis'') from their parents or grandparents who were once Portuguese subjects.

Goans moved considerably to other parts of the Portuguese Empire, and metropolitan Portugal and it is possible to find Goans with roots in America, Africa, Europe as well as Asia.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, there began a large-scale emigration of Goan Catholics to Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]), in search of employment opportunities. The British saw them as Portuguese citizens and favoured them in administration due to their ease in the use of English and predominantly Western culture. At that time [[History of Bombay under British rule (1661\u20131947)|Bombay was under the British rule]] and there existed another established Luso-Indian Catholic community; the [[East Indians]], who were former residents of Portuguese Bombay prior to being granted to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] in the seventeenth century. Since the Goan and East Indian Catholic communities were converted to [[Christianity]] by the Portuguese, the British referred to them as \"Portuguese Christians\".<ref name=\"bapp25\">{{harvnb|Baptista|1967|p=25|Ref=bap}}</ref> They congregated in the same churches, attended many of the same religious functions, and shared [[Portuguese naming customs|Portuguese surnames]] and culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&printsec=frontcover#PPA345,M1 Migrants in Bombay, p. 345]|Ref=larsen}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1951, to avert international criticism, Portugal amended her Constitution to declare Goa as an overseas province.<ref>{{harvnb|Asian recorder|1962|p=4371|Ref=as}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asian recorder|1962|p=4440|Ref=as}}</ref> After Goa was merged into the [[Indian Union]] in 1961, Goan Catholics continued to distinguish themselves as \"[[Goans|Goan]]\" as they found it hard to adapt to the term \"[[Indian people|Indian]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&printsec=frontcover#PPA169,M1 169]|Ref=larsen}}</ref> \n\nAfter 450 years of being a part of Portugal, during the first post-Liberation years, Goans found it difficult to embrace their new status as part of India and many emigrated to other nations (predominately western), a trend that often continues to date.<ref>{{harvnb|Larsen|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&printsec=frontcover#PPA170,M1 170]|Ref=larsen}}</ref> However, Goan-Catholics in India today are proud of their Portuguese-Indian Catholic culture, their [[Konkani language|Konkani]] language and their role in modern multi-religious India. Hence, many aspects of their social and religious life are deeply enshrined in their exquisite western heritage. For instance, they celebrate [[Carnival]] (western practice) before [[Lent]] and their religious scripture is only [[Konkani in the Roman script|Konkani written and conducted]] in the [[Roman script]]. Even their Konkani dialect takes a lot from Portuguese in terms of syntax or loan words.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Goan Catholics}}\n\n===Pre-Portuguese era===\nPre-colonial Goan history includes Hindu, Buddhists and Islamic religious phases. It was believed till recently that there was no concrete evidence that Christianity prevailed in Goa before the Portuguese arrived, but it was believed that [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]], one of the twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, brought the Gospel and spread it in [[Konkan]], including Goa, just as [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] had done in [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], in [[South India|Southern India]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ayyappapanicker|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC&printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA263,M1 263]|Ref=ayy}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the work of the historian Jose Cosme Costa, ''Apostolic Christianity in Goa and in the West Coast'' (Pilar, Goa: Xavierian Publication Society, 2009), makes a case for the existence of Christianity in Goa before the arrival of the Portuguese. He speaks of Goa as a trading centre with the Middle East and with Rome). He suggests that the Apostle Thomas might have made his way over land from northern India to Kerala. He also examines the evidence of the Apostle Bartholomew having done more or less the same thing. Ch. 6 is dedicated to the examination of Pre-Portuguese references to Christianity in Goa. Ch. 7 examines the vestiges of Pre-Portuguese Christian Customs in Goa and the Konkan. Ch. 8 concludes the book with the \"latest archaeological discovery\": a \"Thomas Cross\" hidden in a smallish monument, surmounted by a Latin Cross, near the old Goa harbor. The Thomas Cross bears an inscription in Pahlavi, which, Costa reports, was the liturgical language of the church associated with the Metropolitan of Fars.<ref>Costa 35.

Fr [[Hubert Olympus Mascarenhas|H.O. Mascarenhas]], reports Costa, even proposed that there were Christian temples dedicated to the persons of the Trinity: Abanath / Bhutnath (Father Lord), Ravalnath (from Rabboni&nbsp;\u2013 Rabulna&nbsp;\u2013 Rabulnath) / Bhai rav (Brother Lord), and Atman / Bhavka Devta, Santeri, Ajadevi (Spirit).<ref>See H.O.

This unsuccessful action was the first open revolt against the Portuguese from within Goa. Britain gained control of Goa twice, the first time in 1797\u20131798 and the second time from 1802 to 1813.

The standard defines the electrical connection between the chips to be a two wire, shared([[multidrop bus|multidrop]]), [[serial communication|serial data]] [[bus (computing)|bus]], one wire (<code>SCL</code>) being used as a clock to define the sampling times, the other wire (<code>SDA</code>) being used as a data line whose voltage can be sampled. The standard defines a signalling protocol in which multiple chips can control communication and thereby act as the bus [[master (device)|master]].\n\nThe I3C specification takes its name from, uses the same electrical connections as, and allows some backward compatibility with, the [[I\u00b2C]] bus, a de facto [[technical standard|standard]] for inter-chip communication, widely used for low-speed peripherals and sensors in computer systems. The I3C standard is designed to retain some [[backward compatibility]] with the [[I\u00b2C]] system, notably allowing designs where existing I\u00b2C devices can be connected to an I3C bus but still have the bus able to switch to a higher [[Bit rate|data rate]] for communication at higher speeds between compliant I3C devices. The I3C standard thereby combines the advantage of the simple, two wire I\u00b2C architecture with the higher communication speeds common to more complicated buses such as the [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI).\n\nThe I3C standard was developed as a collaborative effort between electronics and computer related companies under auspices of the Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance ([[MIPI Alliance]]). The I3C standard was first released to the public at the end of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/business-wire/mipi-alliance-opens-access-to-its-mipi-i3c-sensor-interface-specification/article22310984.ece|title=MIPI Alliance opens access to its MIPI I3C Sensor Interface Specification|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.evaluationengineering.com/home/article/13014940/mipi-alliance-releases-mipi-i3c-sensorinterface-specification|title=MIPI Alliance releases MIPI I3C sensor-interface specification|website=www.evaluationengineering.com}}</ref>, although access requires the disclosure of private information.

In legacy and SDR modes, these signals are used in a way very similarly to I2C:\n\n* SCL is a conventional digital [[clock signal]], driven with a [[Push\u2013pull output|push-pull output]] by the bus current master during data transfers.   In transactions involving legacy slave devices, this clock signal generally has a [[duty cycle]], of approximately 50%, but in transactions with known I3C slaves, the bus master may switch to a higher frequency by altering the duty cycle to one where the SCL high period is limited to no more than 40 ns.   \n* SDA is carries the serial data stream, which may be driven by either master or slave, but is driven at a rate determined by the master's SCL signal.   For compatibility with the I2C protocol, SDA is initially driven with [[Open collector|open-drain outputs]], which limits the transmission speed.  For transactions involving a I3C slave, the SDA driver mode switches to push-pull after receiving some of the first bits in a packet, allowing substantial speed improvements.   This medium-speed feature is called standard data rate (SDR) mode\n\n=== Framing ===\nAll communications in I2C and I3C requires [[Frame (networking)|framing]] for synchronization.   Within a frame, changes on the SDA line should always occur while SCL is in the low state, so that SDA can be considered stable on the low-to-high transition of SCL.   Violations of this general rule are used for framing (at least in legacy and standard data rate modes.\n\nBetween data frames, the bus master holds SCL high, in effect stopping the clock, and SDA drivers are in a high-impedance state, permitting a pull-up resistor to float it to high.   A high-to-low transition of SDA, while SCL his high, is known as a START symbol, and signals the beginning a new data frame.   A low-to-high transition on SDA, while SCL is high, is the STOP symbol, ending a data frame.\n\nIn I2C, the START symbol is usually generated by a bus master, but in I3C, even slave devices can pull SDA low to indicate they want to start a frame.   This is used to implement some advanced I3C features, such as in-band interrupts, and hot-joins.    After the start, the bus master restarts the clock by driving SCL, and begins the bus arbitration process.\n\n=== Bus Arbitration ===\nAt the start of a frame, several devices may contend for use of the bus, and the bus arbitration process serves to select what device to service next.   In both I2C and I3C, bus arbitration is done based on the device's address, where devices with the lowest address have higher priority.    It is done with the SDA line in open-drain mode, which allows devices transmitting a binary 0 (low) to override devices signaling a binary 1.  Contending devices monitor the SDA line while driving it in open-drain mode.  If they detect a situation where SDA is low at a time their address required it to be high, they know they have lost the bus arbitration, and must cease their contention until the next frame begins.\n\n== Device classes ==\nOn an I3C bus in its default (SDR) mode, four different classes of devices can be supported:\n* I3C Main Master\n* I3C Secondary Master\n* I3C Slave\n* I2C Slave (legacy devices)\n\n== High Data Rate (HDR) options ==\nI3C Buses always initialize in SDR mode. To enter HDR mode, the I3C master issues an \"Enter HDR\" CCC Broadcast command which tells all I3C slaves that \nthe bus is in HDR mode. I3C slaves which do not support HDR have told that to the master and can ignore that command.\nI3C slaves which do not support HDR need to have an \"HDR exit\" detector which informs when it is time to listen to the bus again.\n\nHDR modes operate in either Double Data Rate (DDR) or Ternary Symbol modes.  These modes can only be on buses under one of two limited configurations:\n* A Pure I3C Bus \u2013 no I2C devices on the bus\n* A Mixed Fast Bus \u2013 Where I2C devices on the bus are equipped with a 50&nbsp;ns Spike Filter\n\nThere are three possible HDR modes:\n* HDR-DDR Double Data Rate \u2013 Data transfers on both clock edges, permitting throughput up to 20 Mbit/s (25 Mbit/s raw bit rate) \n* HDR-TSP Ternary Symbol for Pure Bus \u2013 Increases throughput by using both SDA and SCL wires for data.  Not allowed on mixed I2C\u2013I3C bus.\n* HDR-TSL Ternary Symbol for Legacy Bus \u2013 Permits buses including I2C devices (with a spike filter) to operate at higher speeds.\n\n== I2C features not supported in I3C ==\n* Pull-up resistors are provided by the I3C master. External pull-up resistors are no longer needed.\n* Clock Stretching \u2013 devices are expected to be fast enough to operate at bus speed. The I3C master is the sole clock source.\n* I2C Extended (10-bit) Addresses.  All devices on an I3C bus are addressed by a 7-bit address.  Native I3C devices have a unique 48-bit address which is used only during dynamic address assignments.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mipi.org/specifications/i3c%E2%84%A0-sensor-specification MIPI I3C]\n\n{{Computer-bus|collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I2c}}\n[[Category:Serial buses]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox connector <!-- NOTE: Not a perfect template match, but good enough for now -->\n|name               = I3C\n|type               = [[Bus (computing)|Bus]]\n|URL                = \n|image              =\n|logo               = [[File:I3C.png|frameless|Venn Diagram of I3C Heritage]]\n|caption            = \n|designer           = [[MIPI Alliance]]<br/>Sensor Working Group\n|design_date        = {{Start date and age|2016}}\n|manufacturer       = multiple\n|key_people         = Ken Foust, Intel Corporation; Satwant Singh, Lattice Semiconductor\n|production_date    =  \n|preceded_by        = [[I\u00b2C]]\n|superseded         = \n|superseded_by      =\n|superseded_by_date =\n|external           = \n|hotplug            = true\n|length             = \n|width              = \n|height             = \n|electrical         = [[CMOS]]\n|ground             = \n|maximum_voltage    = \n|maximum_current    = \n|data_signal        = [[Open drain|Open-drain or Push/Pull]]\n|data_bit_width     = 2 wires [data + clock]\n|data_bandwidth     = 12.5&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(SDR, standard),\n25&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(DDR),\n33&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(ternary),\n<br/>'''legacy I\u00b2C rates'''<br/>\n400&nbsp;[[Kilobit|Kbits/s]]&nbsp;(FM),\n1&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(FM+)\n|data_devices       = \n|data_style         = [[Serial communication|Serial]], [[half-duplex]]\n|cable              = \n|physical_connector = \n|num_pins           = \n|pinout_col1_name   =\n|pinout_col2_name   =\n|pinout_image       = \n|pinout_caption     = \n|pinout_notes       =\n}}\n\n'''I3C''' (also known as '''SenseWire''') is a [[specifications|specification]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mipi.org/specifications/i3c-sensor-specification|title=MIPI I3C and I3C Basic|website=mipi.org}}</ref> to enable communication between [[Integrated_circuit|computer chips]] by defining the electrical connection between the chips and signaling patterns to be used. The standard defines the electrical connection between the chips to be a two wire, shared([[multidrop bus|multidrop]]), [[serial communication|serial data]] [[bus (computing)|bus]], one wire (<code>SCL</code>) being used as a clock to define the sampling times, the other wire (<code>SDA</code>) being used as a data line whose voltage can be sampled. The standard defines a signalling protocol in which multiple chips can control communication and thereby act as the bus [[master (device)|master]].\n\nThe I3C specification takes its name from, uses the same electrical connections as, and allows some backward compatibility with, the [[I\u00b2C]] bus, a de facto [[technical standard|standard]] for inter-chip communication, widely used for low-speed peripherals and sensors in computer systems. The I3C standard is designed to retain some [[backward compatibility]] with the [[I\u00b2C]] system, notably allowing designs where existing I\u00b2C devices can be connected to an I3C bus but still have the bus able to switch to a higher [[Bit rate|data rate]] for communication at higher speeds between compliant I3C devices. The I3C standard thereby combines the advantage of the simple, two wire I\u00b2C architecture with the higher communication speeds common to more complicated buses such as the [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI).\n\nThe I3C standard was developed as a collaborative effort between electronics and computer related companies under auspices of the Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance ([[MIPI Alliance]]). The I3C standard was first released to the public at the end of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/business-wire/mipi-alliance-opens-access-to-its-mipi-i3c-sensor-interface-specification/article22310984.ece|title=MIPI Alliance opens access to its MIPI I3C Sensor Interface Specification|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.evaluationengineering.com/home/article/13014940/mipi-alliance-releases-mipi-i3c-sensorinterface-specification|title=MIPI Alliance releases MIPI I3C sensor-interface specification|website=www.evaluationengineering.com}}</ref>, although access requires the disclosure of private information.

The term ''Reformed'' is not a reference to political reform but is a synonym for [[Calvinism]]\u2014a major branch of [[Protestantism]]. The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands in its current form and has been in opposition for its entire existence. Owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, the party has been called a [[testimonial party]]. Since the [[2017 Dutch general election|general election of 2017]], it has held 3 of the 150 seats of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]].\n\nThe party has traditionally opposed [[universal suffrage]], seeking to replace this with a form of \"organic suffrage\" (Dutch: ''huismanskiesrecht'', \"suffrage of the ''[[pater familias]]''\") restricted to male heads of households. It also advocates the reestablishment of [[capital punishment in the Netherlands]], which was abolished by a House of Representatives vote in 1870.\n\n==Party history==\n\n===Foundation===\nThe SGP was founded on 24 April 1918, by several conservative members of the Protestant [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). They did not support [[female suffrage]], which the ARP had made possible. Furthermore, they were against the alliance the ARP had formed with the [[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]]. The leading figure in the party's foundation was [[Yerseke]] [[minister (religion)|pastor]] [[Gerrit Hendrik Kersten]], who envisioned a Netherlands \"without [[Movie theater|cinema]], sports, [[vaccination]] and [[social security]]\".<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.parlement.com/9291000/biof/00685 Parlement.com biography]</ref>\n\n===1922\u20131945===\nThe party entered the [[1918 Dutch general election|1918 general elections]], but was unable to win any seats. In the [[1922 Dutch general election|1922 election]] the party entered Parliament when Kersten won a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. In this period the SGP became most noted for proposing, during the annual parliamentary debate on the budget of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, to abolish Dutch representation to the [[Holy See]]. Each year the Protestant [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) also voted in favour of this motion. The CHU was in cabinet with the Catholic General League, but many of its members and supporters still had strong feelings against the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1925, the left-wing opposition (the [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] and [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]]) also voted in favour of the motion. They were indifferent to the representation at the Holy See, but saw the issue as an opportunity to divide the [[Christian democracy in the Netherlands|confessional cabinet]]. The cabinet fell over this issue, in what is known as the ''Nacht van Kersten'' (\"Night of Kersten\").\n\nThe party gained another seat in the [[1925 Dutch general election|1925 election]], and a third seat in the [[1929 Dutch general election|1929 election]]. It retained three seats in the [[1933 Dutch general election|1933 election]], but lost a seat in the [[1937 Dutch general election|1937 election]], in which the ARP led by prime minister [[Hendrikus Colijn]] performed particularly well. During [[The Netherlands in World War II|World War II]], Kersten cooperated with the German occupiers to allow his paper, the ''Banier'', to be printed. He also condemned the [[Dutch resistance during the Second World War|Dutch Resistance]], saying the German invasion was divine retribution for desecrating the Lord's Day. After the war, he was branded a collaborator and permanently stripped of his seat in the House of Representatives.\n\n===1945\u2013present===\n[[File:Kees van der Staaij - SGP 2017.jpg|thumb|[[Kees van der Staaij]], current [[party leader]]]]\nKersten was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Pieter Zandt|nl}}, under whose leadership the SGP was very stable, continually getting 2% of votes. [[1956 Dutch general election|In the 1956 election]], the SGP profited from the enlargement of Parliament, and entered the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] for the first time. It lost that seat in 1960, but regained it in 1971. In 1961 Zandt died and was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Cor van Dis sr.|nl}}, a chemist. After ten years he stood down in favour of Reverend Hette Abma, who also stepped down after ten years, in favour of Henk van Rossum, a civil engineer. [[1984 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|In the 1984 European Parliament election]], the SGP joined the two other orthodox Protestant parties (the [[Reformatory Political Federation]] (RPF) and the [[Reformed Political League]] (GPV)). They won one seat in the European Parliament, which was taken by SGP member [[Leen van der Waal]], a mechanical engineer. In 1986, Van Rossum was succeeded by [[Bas van der Vlies]], who led the party till March 2010, when he was succeeded by [[Kees van der Staaij]]. In the [[1994 Dutch general election|1994 election]] the party lost one seat in the House, [[1998 Dutch general election|regained it in 1998]], and [[2002 Dutch general election|lost it again in 2002]]. After the [[2003 Dutch general election|general election of 2003]], the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) held talks with the SGP \u2014 the first time in memory that the SGP was seriously considered as a possible coalition partner. Ultimately, the [[Democrats 66]] joined the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] instead of the SGP, mostly because of the ideological differences between VVD and SGP.\n\nOn 7 September 2005, the district court of The Hague judged that the party could no longer receive subsidies from the government, because women were not allowed to hold positions in the party.  This was found to be a violation of the 1981 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Treaty on Women]] in which the Netherlands committed to fighting discrimination. It also was a violation of the first article of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch constitution]], the principle of non-discrimination. The Dutch Council of State overturned the decision nevertheless, maintaining that a party's political philosophy takes precedence, and that women have the opportunity to join other political parties where they can obtain a leadership role.<ref>{{cite news |title=SGP will get subsidy after all |url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=46669 |publisher=Expatica |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=5 December 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFemale members of the [[Reformed Political Party Youth]] (SGPJ), which did allow female membership, said however that they did not feel discriminated or repressed.  During a party congress on 24 June 2006, the SGP lifted the ban on female membership. Political positions inside and outside the party are open to women. On 19 March 2014, the first female SGP delegate was [[2014 Dutch municipal elections|elected to the municipal council]] in [[Vlissingen]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://nos.nl/artikel/625641-sgpvrouw-komt-in-raad-vlissingen.html |title = SGP-vrouw komt in raad Vlissingen |publisher = NOS |accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIts 2017-2021 party programme was notable for not including core tenets of the party ideology such as abolishment of gay marriage.\n\n==Ideology and issues==\n{{primary sources|section|date=November 2015}}\nAs a [[Christian fundamentalism|Protestant fundamentalist]] party,<ref name=\"Abedi2004\"/> the SGP draws much from its ideology from the [[reformed tradition]], specifically the ecclesiastical doctrinal standards known as the [[Three Forms of Unity]], including an unamended version of the [[Belgic Confession]] (''Nederlandse Geloofsbelijdenis''). The latter text is explicitly mentioned in the first principle of the party,{{Sfn |SGP |2003 |p = 11}} where it is stated that the SGP strives towards a government totally based on the Bible. This first principle also states that the uncut version of the Belgic Confession is meant, which adds the task of opposing anti-Christian powers to the description of the government's roles and tasks.{{Sfn |SGP |2003 |p = 16}} The party is a strict defender of the [[separation between church and state]],{{Sfn | SGP | 2003 | p = 17}} rejecting \"both the [[state church]] and church state\". Both church and state are believed to have distinct roles in society, while working towards the same goal, but despite this, some accuse the SGP of advocating for theocracy.{{Sfn |D\u00f6lle |2005 |p = 104}} The SGP opposes [[freedom of religion]], but advocates [[freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] instead, noting that \"the obedience to the Law of God cannot be forced\".{{Sfn |SGP |2003|p = 27-28}}\n\nThe SGP opposes [[feminism]], and concludes, on Biblical grounds, that men and women are of equal value (''gelijkwaardig'') but inherently different (''gelijk'').{{Sfn |SGP |2003 |p = 37}}  Men and women, so the party claims, have different places in society.

The party favours the re-introduction of the [[death penalty]] in the Netherlands. They base this on the [[Bible]], specifically on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis 9:6]], \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\", and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus 21:12]], \"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.\"\n\n===Electoral results===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Election year\n! colspan=4|House of Representatives\n! rowspan=2|Government\n! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n! # of<br />overall votes\n! % of<br />overall vote\n! # of<br />overall seats won\n! +/\u2013\n|-\n!

Since winning a second seat in 1926, it has usually varied between two and three seats in the House of Representatives. The party has been called \u201can almost perfect illustration of Duverger's category of 'fossilised' minor party.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Dynamics of Dutch Politics | first = Robert C | last = Bone | journal = The Journal of Politics | volume = 24 | number = 1 |date=Feb 1962 | page = 43| doi = 10.2307/2126736 | jstor = 2126736 }}</ref>\n\nMost of its electorate is formed by so-called \"bevindelijk gereformeerden\", Reformed Christians for whom personal religious experience is very important. This group is formed by several smaller churches such as the [[Christian Reformed Churches]], [[Reformed Congregations]], [[Restored Reformed Church]], and [[Old-Reformed Congregations in the Netherlands]], as well as the conservative wing of the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[Reformed Association in the Protestant Church in the Netherlands|Reformed Association]]. However, not all members of these churches / church wings vote SGP.\n\nThe SGP's support is concentrated geographically in the [[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|Dutch bible belt]], a band of strongly Reformed municipalities ranging from [[Zeeland]] in the South via [[Goeree-Overflakkee]] and the [[Alblasserwaard]] in [[South Holland]] and the [[Veluwe]] in [[Gelderland]] to the Western part of [[Overijssel]], around [[Staphorst]]. The SGP is also very strong on the former island [[Urk]] and also in [[Uddel]]; in both places it received a majority of the vote in 2017.  <ref> {{cite web |url=https://maps.nrc.nl/tk2017dev/tk2017sb.php |title=Uitslagenkaart Tweede Kamerverkiezingen 2017 per stambureau}} </ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Organisational structure===\nThe highest organ of the SGP is the congress, which is formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board and decides the order of the Senate, House of Representatives, European Parliament candidates list and has the last say over the party program. The SGP chairman is always a [[minister (religion)|minister]]. Since 2001 this position is ceremonial, as the general chair leads the party's organisation.\n\nThe party has 245 municipal branches and has a provincial federation in each province, except for [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]].\n\n===Linked organisations===\nThe party publishes the Banner two-weekly since 1921. The scientific institute of the party is called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido de Br\u00e8s-foundation|nl|3=Guido de Br\u00e8s-Stichting}}, which publishes the magazine Zicht (Sight). The youth organisation of the SGP is called the [[Reformed Political Party Youth]] (SGPJ), which with its approximately 12,000 members is the largest political youth organization in the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe SGP participates in the [[Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy]], a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.\n\n===Pillarised organisations===\nThe SGP still has close links with several other orthodox Protestant organisations, such as several reformed churches and the newspaper ''[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]]''. Together they form a small but strong orthodox-reformed [[Pillarisation|pillar]].\n\n===Relationships to other parties===\nUntil 1963, the SGP was relatively isolated in parliament. The strongly antipapal SGP refused to cooperate with either the [[Catholic People's Party]] or the secularist [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA). The larger Protestant [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) had some sympathy for the party, but cooperated tightly with the KVP and the Protestant [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU). In 1963 another orthodox Protestant party, the [[Reformed Political League]] (GPV) entered parliament, in 1981 they were joined by the [[Reformatory Political Federation]] (RPF). Together these three parties formed the \"Small Christian parties\".  They shared the same orthodox Protestant political ideals and had the same political strategy, as [[testimonial party|testimonial parties]]. They cooperated in municipalities, both in [[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders|municipal executives]], where the parties were strong, as well as in common municipal parties, where the parties were weak. In the [[1984 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|1984 European Parliamentary election]] the parties presented a common list and they won one seat in parliament.  After 1993 the cooperation between the GPV and the RPF intensified, but the SGP's position at the time on [[female suffrage]] prevented the SGP joining this closer cooperation. However, in 2000 the GPV and RPF merged to form the [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|ChristianUnion]] (CU). Traditionally the SGP and the CU worked together closely as they were both based on Protestant Christian [[Christianity and politics|politics]]. Recently however, as the CU has moved more towards the centre-left,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} discernible differences of philosophy between the SGP and CU have caused the parties to not join together in elections. The most notable example was the 2011 senate election where the SGP and CU did not combine their votes.<ref>{{cite episode |title=ChristenUnie en SGP lastig door \u00e9\u00e9n deur |url=http://archief.wereldomroep.nl/nederlands/radioshow/christenunie-en-sgp-lastig-door-%C3%A9%C3%A9n-deur |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233452/http://archief.wereldomroep.nl/nederlands/radioshow/christenunie-en-sgp-lastig-door-%C3%A9%C3%A9n-deur |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2015 |series=Nieuwslijn Magazine |network=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=8 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nPrime Minister [[Mark Rutte]]'s [[First Rutte cabinet|first government]] depended on the SGP's support in the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] to pass legislation where it fell one seat short of a majority in the [[2011 Dutch provincial elections|2011 provincial elections]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/671701-caught-between-geert-wilders-and-holy-joes | title = Netherlands: Caught between Geert Wilders and holy joes | publisher = Presseurop | place = [[European Union|EU]] | date = 2011-05-24 | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111128083653/http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/671701-caught-between-geert-wilders-and-holy-joes | archive-date = 2011-11-28 | url-status = dead }}</ref> As a result, the party was able to achieve a number of its own political objectives: continuing child support for larger families,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-government-u-turn-child-benefit | title = Dutch government U-turn on child benefit | publisher = Radio Netherlands Worldwide | date = 2011-09-19 | accessdate = 2013-08-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110921032522/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-government-u-turn-child-benefit | archive-date = 2011-09-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and restricting business hours on Sundays.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://m.rnw.nl/english/node/41761 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120715092506/http://m.rnw.nl/english/node/41761 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 15 July 2012 |title = Press Review |date = 22 April 2011 |publisher = Radio Netherlands Worldwide |accessdate = 2013-08-28 }}</ref>  As previously mentioned, it was seriously considered as a coalition partner in 2003.

The term ''Reformed'' is not a reference to political reform but is a synonym for [[Calvinism]]\u2014a major branch of [[Protestantism]]. The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands in its current form and has been in opposition for its entire existence. Owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, the party has been called a [[testimonial party]]. Since the [[2017 Dutch general election|general election of 2017]], it has held 3 of the 150 seats of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]].\n\nThe party has traditionally opposed [[universal suffrage]], seeking to replace this with a form of \"organic suffrage\" (Dutch: ''huismanskiesrecht'', \"suffrage of the ''[[pater familias]]''\") restricted to male heads of households. It also advocates the reestablishment of [[capital punishment in the Netherlands]], which was abolished by a House of Representatives vote in 1870.\n\n==Party history==\n\n===Foundation===\nThe SGP was founded on 24 April 1918, by several conservative members of the Protestant [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). They did not support [[female suffrage]], which the ARP had made possible. Furthermore, they were against the alliance the ARP had formed with the [[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]]. The leading figure in the party's foundation was [[Yerseke]] [[minister (religion)|pastor]] [[Gerrit Hendrik Kersten]], who envisioned a Netherlands \"without [[Movie theater|cinema]], sports, [[vaccination]] and [[social security]]\".<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.parlement.com/9291000/biof/00685 Parlement.com biography]</ref>\n\n===1922\u20131945===\nThe party entered the [[1918 Dutch general election|1918 general elections]], but was unable to win any seats. In the [[1922 Dutch general election|1922 election]] the party entered Parliament when Kersten won a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. In this period the SGP became most noted for proposing, during the annual parliamentary debate on the budget of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, to abolish Dutch representation to the [[Holy See]]. Each year the Protestant [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) also voted in favour of this motion. The CHU was in cabinet with the Catholic General League, but many of its members and supporters still had strong feelings against the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1925, the left-wing opposition (the [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] and [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]]) also voted in favour of the motion. They were indifferent to the representation at the Holy See, but saw the issue as an opportunity to divide the [[Christian democracy in the Netherlands|confessional cabinet]]. The cabinet fell over this issue, in what is known as the ''Nacht van Kersten'' (\"Night of Kersten\").\n\nThe party gained another seat in the [[1925 Dutch general election|1925 election]], and a third seat in the [[1929 Dutch general election|1929 election]]. It retained three seats in the [[1933 Dutch general election|1933 election]], but lost a seat in the [[1937 Dutch general election|1937 election]], in which the ARP led by prime minister [[Hendrikus Colijn]] performed particularly well. During [[The Netherlands in World War II|World War II]], Kersten cooperated with the German occupiers to allow his paper, the ''Banier'', to be printed. He also condemned the [[Dutch resistance during the Second World War|Dutch Resistance]], saying the German invasion was divine retribution for desecrating the Lord's Day. After the war, he was branded a collaborator and permanently stripped of his seat in the House of Representatives.\n\n===1945\u2013present===\n[[File:Kees van der Staaij - SGP 2017.jpg|thumb|[[Kees van der Staaij]], current [[party leader]]]]\nKersten was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Pieter Zandt|nl}}, under whose leadership the SGP was very stable, continually getting 2% of votes. [[1956 Dutch general election|In the 1956 election]], the SGP profited from the enlargement of Parliament, and entered the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] for the first time. It lost that seat in 1960, but regained it in 1971. In 1961 Zandt died and was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Cor van Dis sr.|nl}}, a chemist. After ten years he stood down in favour of Reverend Hette Abma, who also stepped down after ten years, in favour of Henk van Rossum, a civil engineer. [[1984 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|In the 1984 European Parliament election]], the SGP joined the two other orthodox Protestant parties (the [[Reformatory Political Federation]] (RPF) and the [[Reformed Political League]] (GPV)). They won one seat in the European Parliament, which was taken by SGP member [[Leen van der Waal]], a mechanical engineer. In 1986, Van Rossum was succeeded by [[Bas van der Vlies]], who led the party till March 2010, when he was succeeded by [[Kees van der Staaij]]. In the [[1994 Dutch general election|1994 election]] the party lost one seat in the House, [[1998 Dutch general election|regained it in 1998]], and [[2002 Dutch general election|lost it again in 2002]]. After the [[2003 Dutch general election|general election of 2003]], the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) held talks with the SGP \u2014 the first time in memory that the SGP was seriously considered as a possible coalition partner. Ultimately, the [[Democrats 66]] joined the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] instead of the SGP, mostly because of the ideological differences between VVD and SGP.\n\nOn 7 September 2005, the district court of The Hague judged that the party could no longer receive subsidies from the government, because women were not allowed to hold positions in the party.  This was found to be a violation of the 1981 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Treaty on Women]] in which the Netherlands committed to fighting discrimination. It also was a violation of the first article of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch constitution]], the principle of non-discrimination. The Dutch Council of State overturned the decision nevertheless, maintaining that a party's political philosophy takes precedence, and that women have the opportunity to join other political parties where they can obtain a leadership role.<ref>{{cite news |title=SGP will get subsidy after all |url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&story_id=46669 |publisher=Expatica |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=5 December 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFemale members of the [[Reformed Political Party Youth]] (SGPJ), which did allow female membership, said however that they did not feel discriminated or repressed.

The latter text is explicitly mentioned in the first principle of the party,{{Sfn |SGP |2003 |p = 11}} where it is stated that the SGP strives towards a government totally based on the Bible. This first principle also states that the uncut version of the Belgic Confession is meant, which adds the task of opposing anti-Christian powers to the description of the government's roles and tasks.{{Sfn |SGP |2003 |p = 16}} The party is a strict defender of the [[separation between church and state]],{{Sfn | SGP | 2003 | p = 17}} rejecting \"both the [[state church]] and church state\".

It appoints the party board and decides the order of the Senate, House of Representatives, European Parliament candidates list and has the last say over the party program. The SGP chairman is always a [[minister (religion)|minister]].

The scientific institute of the party is called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido de Br\u00e8s-foundation|nl|3=Guido de Br\u00e8s-Stichting}}, which publishes the magazine Zicht (Sight).

Together they form a small but strong orthodox-reformed [[Pillarisation|pillar]].\n\n===Relationships to other parties===\nUntil 1963, the SGP was relatively isolated in parliament. The strongly antipapal SGP refused to cooperate with either the [[Catholic People's Party]] or the secularist [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA). The larger Protestant [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) had some sympathy for the party, but cooperated tightly with the KVP and the Protestant [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU). In 1963 another orthodox Protestant party, the [[Reformed Political League]] (GPV) entered parliament, in 1981 they were joined by the [[Reformatory Political Federation]] (RPF). Together these three parties formed the \"Small Christian parties\".  They shared the same orthodox Protestant political ideals and had the same political strategy, as [[testimonial party|testimonial parties]]. They cooperated in municipalities, both in [[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders|municipal executives]], where the parties were strong, as well as in common municipal parties, where the parties were weak. In the [[1984 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|1984 European Parliamentary election]] the parties presented a common list and they won one seat in parliament.  After 1993 the cooperation between the GPV and the RPF intensified, but the SGP's position at the time on [[female suffrage]] prevented the SGP joining this closer cooperation. However, in 2000 the GPV and RPF merged to form the [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|ChristianUnion]] (CU). Traditionally the SGP and the CU worked together closely as they were both based on Protestant Christian [[Christianity and politics|politics]].

From early works on the relationship between schooling and labor market outcomes for individuals, the field of the economics of education has grown rapidly to cover virtually all areas with linkages to education.\n\n== Education as an investment ==\n\nEconomics distinguishes in addition to physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] another form of capital that is no less critical as a means of production \u2013 [[human capital]]. With investments in human capital, such as education, three major economic effects can be expected:<ref name=\"Weil\">{{cite book |last=Weil |first=David N. |authorlink=David Weil |year=2009 |title=Economic Growth |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-321-41662-9 }}</ref>\n* ''increased [[expense]]s'' as the accumulation of human capital requires investments just as physical capital does,\n* ''increased [[productivity]]'' as people gain characteristics that enable them to produce more output and hence\n* ''[[return on investment]]'' in the form of higher [[income]]s.\n\n=== Investment costs ===\nInvestments in human capital entail an investment cost, just as any investment does. Typically in [[Europe]]an countries most education expenditure takes the form of [[public sector|government consumption]], although some costs are also borne by individuals. These investments can be rather costly. [[European Union|EU]] governments spent between 3% and 8% of [[GDP]] on education in 2005, the average being 5%.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eurostat |year=2008 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-117/EN/KS-SF-08-117-EN.PDF |title=5% of EU GDP is spent by governments on education |work=Statistics in Focus 117/2008 |access-date=2013-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230153900/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-117/EN/KS-SF-08-117-EN.PDF |archive-date=2008-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, measuring the spending this way alone greatly underestimates the costs because a more subtle form of costs is completely overlooked: the opportunity cost of forgone wages as students cannot work while they study. It has been estimated that the total costs, including opportunity costs, of education are as much as double the direct costs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kendrick |first=J. |year=1976 |title=The Formation and Stocks of Total Capital |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |edition= |isbn=978-0-87014-271-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/formationstockso0000kend }}</ref>\nIncluding opportunity costs investments in education can be estimated to have been around 10% of GDP in the EU countries in 2005. In comparison, investments in physical capital were 20% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eurostat |year=2008 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=2053,70407100&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=GDP expenditure and investment |access-date=2013-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045458/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=2053,70407100&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |archive-date=2014-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thus the two are of similar magnitude.\n[[File:Average years of schooling versus GDP per capita.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Average years of schooling versus GDP per capita (US$2005).]]\n\n=== Returns on investment ===\nHuman capital in the form of education shares many characteristics with physical capital. Both require an investment to create and, once created, both have [[economic value]]. Physical capital earns a return because people are willing to pay to use a piece of physical capital in work as it allows them to produce more output. To measure the productive value of physical capital, we can simply measure how much of a return it commands in the market. In the case of human capital calculating returns is more complicated \u2013 after all, we cannot separate education from the person to see how much it rents for.\nTo get around this problem, the returns to human capital are generally inferred from differences in wages among people with different levels of education. Hall and Jones have calculated from international data that on average that the returns on education are 13.4% per year for first four years of schooling (grades 1\u20134), 10.1% per year for the next four years (grades 5\u20138) and 6.8% for each year beyond eight years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Robert E. |authorlink=Robert Hall (economist) |last2=Jones |first2=Charles I. |authorlink2=Charles Jones (economist) |year=1999 |title=Why Do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output per Worker than Others? |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=83\u2013116 |doi=10.1162/003355399555954 |citeseerx=10.1.1.337.3070 }}</ref> Thus someone with 12 years of schooling can be expected to earn, on average, 1.134<sup>4</sup> \u00d7 1.101<sup>4</sup> \u00d7 1.068<sup>4</sup> = 3.161 times as much as someone with no schooling at all.\n[[File:Predicted versus actual GDP per worker.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Predicted versus actual GDP per worker. The figure shows how much one would expect each country's GDP to be higher based on the data on average years of schooling]]\n\n=== Effects on productivity ===\nEconomy-wide, the effect of human capital on incomes has been estimated to be rather significant: 65% of [[wage]]s paid in [[developed countries]] is payments to human capital and only 35% to raw [[Labour economics|labor]].<ref name=\"Weil\"/> The higher productivity of well-educated workers is one of the factors that explain higher GDPs and, therefore, higher incomes in developed countries. A strong correlation between GDP and education is clearly visible among the countries of the world, as is shown by the upper left figure. It is less clear, however, how much of a high GDP is explained by education. After all, it is also possible that rich countries can simply afford more education.\n\nTo distinguish the part of GDP explained with education from other causes, Weil<ref name=\"Weil\"/> has calculated how much one would expect each country's GDP to be higher based on the data on average schooling. This was based on the above-mentioned calculations of Hall and Jones on the returns on education. GDPs predicted by Weil's calculations can be plotted against actual GDPs, as is done in the figure on the left, demonstrating that the variation in education explains some, but not all, of the variation in GDP.\n\nFinally, the matter of [[externalities]] should be considered. Usually when speaking of externalities one thinks of the negative effects of economic activities that are not included in market prices, such as pollution. These are negative externalities. However, there are also positive externalities \u2013 that is, positive effects of which someone can benefit without having to pay for it.\nEducation bears with it major positive externalities: giving one person more education raises not only his or her output but also the output of those around him or her. Educated workers can bring new technologies, methods and information to the consideration of others. They can teach things to others and act as an example. The positive externalities of education include the effects of personal networks and the roles educated workers play in them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brokerage and Closure|last=Burt|first=Ronald S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780199249152|location=United Kingdom|pages=46\u201355}}</ref>\n\nPositive externalities from human capital are one explanation for why governments are involved in education. If people were left on their own, they would not take into account the full social benefit of education \u2013 in other words the rise in the output and wages of others \u2013 so the amount they would choose to obtain would be lower than the social optimum.<ref name=\"Weil\"/>\n\n== Demand for education ==\n\n=== Liberal approaches ===\nThe dominant model of the demand for education is based on [[human capital]] theory. The central idea is that undertaking education is [[investment]] in the acquisition of skills and knowledge which will increase [[earnings]], or provide long-term benefits such as an appreciation of literature (sometimes referred to as [[cultural capital]]).<ref>\nDaniele Checchi, 2006. ''The Economics of Education: NYUMBANI Human Capital, Family Background and Inequality'', Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-79310-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-79310-0}} [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521793100 Description.]</ref> An increase in human capital can follow technological progress as knowledgeable employees are in demand due to the need for their skills, whether it be in understanding the production process or in operating machines. Studies from 1958 attempted to calculate the returns from additional schooling (the percent increase in income acquired through an additional year of schooling). Later results attempted to allow for different returns across persons or by level of education.<ref>[[David Card]] \"returns to schooling,\"  ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'' , 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000240 Abstract.]</ref>\n\nStatistics have shown that countries with high enrollment/graduation rates have grown faster than countries without.  The [[United States]] has been the world leader in educational advances, beginning with the [[high school movement]] (1910\u20131950). There also seems to be a correlation between gender differences in education with the level of growth; more development is observed in countries which have an equal distribution of the percentage of women versus men who graduated from high school. When looking at correlations in the data, education seems to generate economic growth; however, it could be that we have this causality relationship backwards. For example, if education is seen as a luxury good, it may be that richer households are seeking out educational attainment as a symbol of status, rather than the relationship of education leading to wealth.\n\nEducational advance is not the only variable for economic growth, though, as it only explains about 14% of the average annual increase in labor productivity over the period 1915-2005.  From lack of a more significant correlation between formal educational achievement and productivity growth, some economists see reason to believe that in today's world many skills and capabilities come by way of learning outside of traditional education, or outside of schooling altogether.<ref>Kling, Arnold and John Merrifield. 2009.\" Goldin and Katz and Education Policy Failings in Historical Perspective\". ''Econ Journal Watch'' 6(1): 2-20.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/goldin-and-katz-and-education-policy-failings-in-historical-perspective]</ref>\n\nAn alternative model of the demand for education, commonly referred to as [[Screening (economics)|screening]], is based on the economic theory of [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]]. The central idea is that the successful completion of education is a signal of ability.<ref>Johannes H\u00f6rner, 2008. \"signalling and screening.\" ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000129  Abstract.]</ref>\n=== Marxist critique ===\nAlthough Marx and Engels did not write widely about the social functions of education, their concepts and methods are theorized and criticized by the influence of Marx as education being used in reproduction of capitalist societies. Marx and Engels approached scholarship as \"revolutionary scholarship\" where education should serve as a propaganda for the struggle of the working class.<ref name=\"marxist persperctive\">{{Cite web |url=http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/marxianperspectivesoneducation.pdf |title=Douglas Kellner, Marxian Perspectives on Educational Philosophy: From Classical Marxism to Critical Pedagogy |access-date=2011-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123021601/http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/marxianperspectivesoneducation.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The classical Marxian paradigm sees education as serving the interest of capital and is seeking alternative modes of education that would prepare students and citizens for more progressive socialist mode of social organizations. Marx and Engels understood education and free time as essential to developing free individuals and creating many-sided human beings, thus for them education should become a more essential part of the life of people unlike capitalist society which is organized mainly around work and the production of commodities.<ref name=\"marxist persperctive\"/>\n\n== Financing and provision ==\nIn most countries [[school]] education is predominantly financed and provided by governments. Public funding and provision also plays a major role in [[higher education]]. Although there is wide agreement on the principle that education, at least at school level, should be financed mainly by governments, there is considerable debate over the desirable extent of public provision of education. Supporters of [[public education]] argue that universal public provision promotes equality of opportunity and social cohesion. Opponents of public provision advocate alternatives such as [[School vouchers|vouchers]].<ref>William A.

While much of existing non-formal and private programmes may not be fully accounted for, it can be deduced from the level of provision that pre-primary  financing remains inadequate, especially when considered against expected benefits. Globally, pre-primary education accounts for the lowest proportion of the total public expenditure on education, in spite of the much-documented positive impact of quality [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] on later learning and other social outcomes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=15}}</ref>\n\n== Education production function ==\nAn ''education production function'' is an application of the economic concept of a [[production function]] to the field of [[education]]. It relates various inputs affecting a student's learning (schools, families, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) to measured outputs including subsequent labor market success, college attendance, graduation rates, and, most frequently, [[standardized test]] scores. The original study that eventually prompted interest in the idea of education production functions was by a sociologist, [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]].  The [[Coleman Report]], published in 1966, concluded that the marginal effect of various school inputs on student achievement was small compared to the impact of families and friends.<ref>[[James Samuel Coleman|Coleman, James S.]], Ernest Q.

From early works on the relationship between schooling and labor market outcomes for individuals, the field of the economics of education has grown rapidly to cover virtually all areas with linkages to education.\n\n== Education as an investment ==\n\nEconomics distinguishes in addition to physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] another form of capital that is no less critical as a means of production \u2013 [[human capital]]. With investments in human capital, such as education, three major economic effects can be expected:<ref name=\"Weil\">{{cite book |last=Weil |first=David N. |authorlink=David Weil |year=2009 |title=Economic Growth |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-321-41662-9 }}</ref>\n* ''increased [[expense]]s'' as the accumulation of human capital requires investments just as physical capital does,\n* ''increased [[productivity]]'' as people gain characteristics that enable them to produce more output and hence\n* ''[[return on investment]]'' in the form of higher [[income]]s.\n\n=== Investment costs ===\nInvestments in human capital entail an investment cost, just as any investment does. Typically in [[Europe]]an countries most education expenditure takes the form of [[public sector|government consumption]], although some costs are also borne by individuals. These investments can be rather costly. [[European Union|EU]] governments spent between 3% and 8% of [[GDP]] on education in 2005, the average being 5%.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eurostat |year=2008 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-117/EN/KS-SF-08-117-EN.PDF |title=5% of EU GDP is spent by governments on education |work=Statistics in Focus 117/2008 |access-date=2013-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230153900/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-117/EN/KS-SF-08-117-EN.PDF |archive-date=2008-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, measuring the spending this way alone greatly underestimates the costs because a more subtle form of costs is completely overlooked: the opportunity cost of forgone wages as students cannot work while they study. It has been estimated that the total costs, including opportunity costs, of education are as much as double the direct costs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kendrick |first=J. |year=1976 |title=The Formation and Stocks of Total Capital |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |edition= |isbn=978-0-87014-271-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/formationstockso0000kend }}</ref>\nIncluding opportunity costs investments in education can be estimated to have been around 10% of GDP in the EU countries in 2005. In comparison, investments in physical capital were 20% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eurostat |year=2008 |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=2053,70407100&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=GDP expenditure and investment |access-date=2013-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045458/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=2053,70407100&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |archive-date=2014-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thus the two are of similar magnitude.\n[[File:Average years of schooling versus GDP per capita.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Average years of schooling versus GDP per capita (US$2005).]]\n\n=== Returns on investment ===\nHuman capital in the form of education shares many characteristics with physical capital. Both require an investment to create and, once created, both have [[economic value]]. Physical capital earns a return because people are willing to pay to use a piece of physical capital in work as it allows them to produce more output. To measure the productive value of physical capital, we can simply measure how much of a return it commands in the market. In the case of human capital calculating returns is more complicated \u2013 after all, we cannot separate education from the person to see how much it rents for.\nTo get around this problem, the returns to human capital are generally inferred from differences in wages among people with different levels of education. Hall and Jones have calculated from international data that on average that the returns on education are 13.4% per year for first four years of schooling (grades 1\u20134), 10.1% per year for the next four years (grades 5\u20138) and 6.8% for each year beyond eight years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Robert E. |authorlink=Robert Hall (economist) |last2=Jones |first2=Charles I. |authorlink2=Charles Jones (economist) |year=1999 |title=Why Do Some Countries Produce So Much More Output per Worker than Others? |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=83\u2013116 |doi=10.1162/003355399555954 |citeseerx=10.1.1.337.3070 }}</ref> Thus someone with 12 years of schooling can be expected to earn, on average, 1.134<sup>4</sup> \u00d7 1.101<sup>4</sup> \u00d7 1.068<sup>4</sup> = 3.161 times as much as someone with no schooling at all.\n[[File:Predicted versus actual GDP per worker.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Predicted versus actual GDP per worker. The figure shows how much one would expect each country's GDP to be higher based on the data on average years of schooling]]\n\n=== Effects on productivity ===\nEconomy-wide, the effect of human capital on incomes has been estimated to be rather significant: 65% of [[wage]]s paid in [[developed countries]] is payments to human capital and only 35% to raw [[Labour economics|labor]].<ref name=\"Weil\"/> The higher productivity of well-educated workers is one of the factors that explain higher GDPs and, therefore, higher incomes in developed countries. A strong correlation between GDP and education is clearly visible among the countries of the world, as is shown by the upper left figure. It is less clear, however, how much of a high GDP is explained by education. After all, it is also possible that rich countries can simply afford more education.\n\nTo distinguish the part of GDP explained with education from other causes, Weil<ref name=\"Weil\"/> has calculated how much one would expect each country's GDP to be higher based on the data on average schooling. This was based on the above-mentioned calculations of Hall and Jones on the returns on education. GDPs predicted by Weil's calculations can be plotted against actual GDPs, as is done in the figure on the left, demonstrating that the variation in education explains some, but not all, of the variation in GDP.\n\nFinally, the matter of [[externalities]] should be considered. Usually when speaking of externalities one thinks of the negative effects of economic activities that are not included in market prices, such as pollution. These are negative externalities. However, there are also positive externalities \u2013 that is, positive effects of which someone can benefit without having to pay for it.\nEducation bears with it major positive externalities: giving one person more education raises not only his or her output but also the output of those around him or her. Educated workers can bring new technologies, methods and information to the consideration of others. They can teach things to others and act as an example. The positive externalities of education include the effects of personal networks and the roles educated workers play in them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brokerage and Closure|last=Burt|first=Ronald S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780199249152|location=United Kingdom|pages=46\u201355}}</ref>\n\nPositive externalities from human capital are one explanation for why governments are involved in education. If people were left on their own, they would not take into account the full social benefit of education \u2013 in other words the rise in the output and wages of others \u2013 so the amount they would choose to obtain would be lower than the social optimum.<ref name=\"Weil\"/>\n\n== Demand for education ==\n\n=== Liberal approaches ===\nThe dominant model of the demand for education is based on [[human capital]] theory. The central idea is that undertaking education is [[investment]] in the acquisition of skills and knowledge which will increase [[earnings]], or provide long-term benefits such as an appreciation of literature (sometimes referred to as [[cultural capital]]).<ref>\nDaniele Checchi, 2006. ''The Economics of Education: NYUMBANI Human Capital, Family Background and Inequality'', Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-79310-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-79310-0}} [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521793100 Description.]</ref> An increase in human capital can follow technological progress as knowledgeable employees are in demand due to the need for their skills, whether it be in understanding the production process or in operating machines. Studies from 1958 attempted to calculate the returns from additional schooling (the percent increase in income acquired through an additional year of schooling). Later results attempted to allow for different returns across persons or by level of education.<ref>[[David Card]] \"returns to schooling,\"  ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'' , 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000240 Abstract.]</ref>\n\nStatistics have shown that countries with high enrollment/graduation rates have grown faster than countries without.  The [[United States]] has been the world leader in educational advances, beginning with the [[high school movement]] (1910\u20131950). There also seems to be a correlation between gender differences in education with the level of growth; more development is observed in countries which have an equal distribution of the percentage of women versus men who graduated from high school. When looking at correlations in the data, education seems to generate economic growth; however, it could be that we have this causality relationship backwards. For example, if education is seen as a luxury good, it may be that richer households are seeking out educational attainment as a symbol of status, rather than the relationship of education leading to wealth.\n\nEducational advance is not the only variable for economic growth, though, as it only explains about 14% of the average annual increase in labor productivity over the period 1915-2005.  From lack of a more significant correlation between formal educational achievement and productivity growth, some economists see reason to believe that in today's world many skills and capabilities come by way of learning outside of traditional education, or outside of schooling altogether.<ref>Kling, Arnold and John Merrifield. 2009.\" Goldin and Katz and Education Policy Failings in Historical Perspective\". ''Econ Journal Watch'' 6(1): 2-20.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/goldin-and-katz-and-education-policy-failings-in-historical-perspective]</ref>\n\nAn alternative model of the demand for education, commonly referred to as [[Screening (economics)|screening]], is based on the economic theory of [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]]. The central idea is that the successful completion of education is a signal of ability.<ref>Johannes H\u00f6rner, 2008. \"signalling and screening.\" ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000129  Abstract.]</ref>\n=== Marxist critique ===\nAlthough Marx and Engels did not write widely about the social functions of education, their concepts and methods are theorized and criticized by the influence of Marx as education being used in reproduction of capitalist societies. Marx and Engels approached scholarship as \"revolutionary scholarship\" where education should serve as a propaganda for the struggle of the working class.<ref name=\"marxist persperctive\">{{Cite web |url=http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/marxianperspectivesoneducation.pdf |title=Douglas Kellner, Marxian Perspectives on Educational Philosophy: From Classical Marxism to Critical Pedagogy |access-date=2011-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123021601/http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/marxianperspectivesoneducation.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The classical Marxian paradigm sees education as serving the interest of capital and is seeking alternative modes of education that would prepare students and citizens for more progressive socialist mode of social organizations. Marx and Engels understood education and free time as essential to developing free individuals and creating many-sided human beings, thus for them education should become a more essential part of the life of people unlike capitalist society which is organized mainly around work and the production of commodities.<ref name=\"marxist persperctive\"/>\n\n== Financing and provision ==\nIn most countries [[school]] education is predominantly financed and provided by governments. Public funding and provision also plays a major role in [[higher education]]. Although there is wide agreement on the principle that education, at least at school level, should be financed mainly by governments, there is considerable debate over the desirable extent of public provision of education. Supporters of [[public education]] argue that universal public provision promotes equality of opportunity and social cohesion. Opponents of public provision advocate alternatives such as [[School vouchers|vouchers]].<ref>William A.

While much of existing non-formal and private programmes may not be fully accounted for, it can be deduced from the level of provision that pre-primary  financing remains inadequate, especially when considered against expected benefits. Globally, pre-primary education accounts for the lowest proportion of the total public expenditure on education, in spite of the much-documented positive impact of quality [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] on later learning and other social outcomes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002335/233558E.pdf|title=Investing against Evidence: The Global State of Early Childhood Care and Education|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Kaga|first2=Y.|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100113-0|location=|pages=15}}</ref>\n\n== Education production function ==\nAn ''education production function'' is an application of the economic concept of a [[production function]] to the field of [[education]]. It relates various inputs affecting a student's learning (schools, families, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) to measured outputs including subsequent labor market success, college attendance, graduation rates, and, most frequently, [[standardized test]] scores. The original study that eventually prompted interest in the idea of education production functions was by a sociologist, [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]].  The [[Coleman Report]], published in 1966, concluded that the marginal effect of various school inputs on student achievement was small compared to the impact of families and friends.<ref>[[James Samuel Coleman|Coleman, James S.]], Ernest Q.
