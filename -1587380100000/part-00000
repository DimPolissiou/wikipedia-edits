It is located to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting it to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston]] and [[Montreal]], among other destinations. Ottawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. \n\nIt was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa Station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. To the south of the station building are the 5 [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks bordering on Terminal Avenue. \n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa Station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967.

Other [[Top 40]] songs recorded by the Archies include \"Who's Your Baby?\" (U.S. No. 40), \"Bang-Shang-A-Lang\" (U.S. No. 22), and \"[[Jingle Jangle (The Archies song)|Jingle Jangle]]\" (U.S. No. 10).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"Jingle Jangle\" also sold over one million copies, garnering a second gold disc award.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nMale vocals for the fictional Archies group were provided by [[The Cuff Links]]' lead singer [[Ron Dante]] and female duet vocals were provided by [[Toni Wine]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Wine, who was only paid for the recording session and quit the group when the song became a huge hit, was succeeded in 1970 by Donna Marie, who in turn was replaced on the final recordings by Merle Miller. The only Archies song not to feature Ron Dante on lead was 1971's \"Love Is Living In You\", sung by Bob Levine (co-author of the song) and produced by Ritchie Adams. The last single, released 1972, was \"Strangers in the Morning\"; its B-side song was \"Plum Crazy\".\n\n[[Jeff Barry]], [[Andy Kim]], [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Morse, [[Ritchie Adams]], Maeretha Stewart, [[Bobby Bloom]] and [[Lesley Miller]], contributed background vocals at various times, with Barry contributing his trademark bass voice (portrayed as being sung by Jughead in the cartoon) on cuts such as \"Jingle Jangle\", \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\", \"A Summer Prayer For Peace\" (which hit number one in South Africa and Scandinavia in 1971), and \"You Little Angel, You\". Musicians on Archies' records included guitarists [[Hugh McCracken]] and Dave Appell, bassists [[Chuck Rainey]] and Joey Macho, keyboard player Ron Frangipane, and drummers [[Buddy Saltzman]] and [[Gary Chester]].\n\nThe Archies' records were initially released on the Calendar Records label,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> but the name was shortly thereafter changed to Kirshner Records.\n\nThe sound engineer was Fred Weinberg, who was Jeff Barry's and Andy Kim's favorite, and who also recorded Barry's other hits \"[[Be My Baby]]\", \"[[Baby, I Love You]]\", and Kim's \"[[Rock Me Gently (Andy Kim song)|Rock Me Gently]]\". Fred Weinberg is an award-winning composer and producer in his own right. However, the music for ''[[The U.S. of Archie]]'' TV show which aired in 1974, was produced by Jackie Mills, a Hollywood producer, who also produced [[Bobby Sherman]] and the [[The Brady Kids|Brady Kids]]. The vocalist for these shows was Tom McKenzie, who also sang on some ''[[Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies|Groovie Goolies]]'' segments, and was a regular member of the popular singing group, [[The Doodletown Pipers|Doodletown Pipers]].\n\nAlthough the verses of \"Jingle Jangle\" seem to be sung by either [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] or [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]] (the only two female members of the fictional group), the song was actually sung by Dante, using a [[falsetto]] voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbutforgottenoldies.net/interviews/ron-dante/ |title=Interview With Ron Dante |publisher=Allbutforgottenoldies.net |date=2004-10-09 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> \n\nLegendary animator [[Don Bluth]] worked on the show, providing layouts for the series.\n\nSome of the group songs have appeared on episodes of the [[The CW]] televisions series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/artist/the-archies|title=Music from The Archies|work=[[Tunefind]]|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> The group made its live action debut in ''Riverdale'', in the musical episode \"[[Chapter Seventy-Four: Wicked Little Town]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2020/01/28/riverdale-hedwig-musical-episode-season-4/|title=Riverdale Sizes Up Hedwig for Season 4 Musical Episode \u2014 See Who's Singing|last=Swift|first=Andy|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 28, 2020|accessdate=February 21, 2020}}</ref> It includes [[KJ Apa]] as Archie, [[Cole Sprouse]] as Jughead, [[Lili Reinhart]] as Betty, [[Camila Mendes]] as Veronica and [[Casey Cott]] as [[Kevin Keller (comics)|Kevin Keller]].

The most famous is \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\", written by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Andy Kim]],<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which went to number one on the [[music chart|pop chart]] in 1969, sold over six million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/252 252\u2013253]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/252\n}}</ref> In the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], it was ranked as the No. 1 song of that year, the only time a fictional band has ever claimed ''Billboard''{{'}}s annual Hot 100 top spot. Other [[Top 40]] songs recorded by the Archies include \"Who's Your Baby?\" (U.S. No. 40), \"Bang-Shang-A-Lang\" (U.S. No. 22), and \"[[Jingle Jangle (The Archies song)|Jingle Jangle]]\" (U.S. No. 10).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"Jingle Jangle\" also sold over one million copies, garnering a second gold disc award.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nMale vocals for the fictional Archies group were provided by [[The Cuff Links]]' lead singer [[Ron Dante]] and female duet vocals were provided by [[Toni Wine]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Wine, who was only paid for the recording session and quit the group when the song became a huge hit, was succeeded in 1970 by Donna Marie, who in turn was replaced on the final recordings by Merle Miller. The only Archies song not to feature Ron Dante on lead was 1971's \"Love Is Living In You\", sung by Bob Levine (co-author of the song) and produced by Ritchie Adams. The last single, released 1972, was \"Strangers in the Morning\"; its B-side song was \"Plum Crazy\".\n\n[[Jeff Barry]], [[Andy Kim]], [[Ellie Greenwich]], Susan Morse, [[Ritchie Adams]], Maeretha Stewart, [[Bobby Bloom]] and [[Lesley Miller]], contributed background vocals at various times, with Barry contributing his trademark bass voice (portrayed as being sung by Jughead in the cartoon) on cuts such as \"Jingle Jangle\", \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\", \"A Summer Prayer For Peace\" (which hit number one in South Africa and Scandinavia in 1971), and \"You Little Angel, You\". Musicians on Archies' records included guitarists [[Hugh McCracken]] and Dave Appell, bassists [[Chuck Rainey]] and Joey Macho, keyboard player Ron Frangipane, and drummers [[Buddy Saltzman]] and [[Gary Chester]].\n\nThe Archies' records were initially released on the Calendar Records label,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> but the name was shortly thereafter changed to Kirshner Records.\n\nThe sound engineer was Fred Weinberg, who was Jeff Barry's and Andy Kim's favorite, and who also recorded Barry's other hits \"[[Be My Baby]]\", \"[[Baby, I Love You]]\", and Kim's \"[[Rock Me Gently (Andy Kim song)|Rock Me Gently]]\". Fred Weinberg is an award-winning composer and producer in his own right. However, the music for ''[[The U.S. of Archie]]'' TV show which aired in 1974, was produced by Jackie Mills, a Hollywood producer, who also produced [[Bobby Sherman]] and the [[The Brady Kids|Brady Kids]]. The vocalist for these shows was Tom McKenzie, who also sang on some ''[[Sabrina and the Groovie Goolies|Groovie Goolies]]'' segments, and was a regular member of the popular singing group, [[The Doodletown Pipers|Doodletown Pipers]].\n\nAlthough the verses of \"Jingle Jangle\" seem to be sung by either [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] or [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]] (the only two female members of the fictional group), the song was actually sung by Dante, using a [[falsetto]] voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbutforgottenoldies.net/interviews/ron-dante/ |title=Interview With Ron Dante |publisher=Allbutforgottenoldies.net |date=2004-10-09 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> \n\nLegendary animator [[Don Bluth]] worked on the show, providing layouts for the series.\n\nSome of the group songs have appeared on episodes of the [[The CW]] televisions series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/artist/the-archies|title=Music from The Archies|work=[[Tunefind]]|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> The group made its live action debut in ''Riverdale'', in the musical episode \"[[Chapter Seventy-Four: Wicked Little Town]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2020/01/28/riverdale-hedwig-musical-episode-season-4/|title=Riverdale Sizes Up Hedwig for Season 4 Musical Episode \u2014 See Who's Singing|last=Swift|first=Andy|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 28, 2020|accessdate=February 21, 2020}}</ref> It includes [[KJ Apa]] as Archie, [[Cole Sprouse]] as Jughead, [[Lili Reinhart]] as Betty, [[Camila Mendes]] as Veronica and [[Casey Cott]] as [[Kevin Keller (comics)|Kevin Keller]].
