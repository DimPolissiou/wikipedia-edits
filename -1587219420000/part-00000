There are several English names under which the surah is known.  These include \u201cThe Inevitable Hour\u201d, \u201cThe Indubitable\u201d, \u201cThe Inevitable Truth\u201d, and \u201cThe Reality\u201d. These titles are derived from alternate translations of al-\u1e24\u0101qqa, the word that appears in the first three ayat of the sura. Though each of these titles may sound very different, each one alludes to the main theme of the sura \u2013 the Day of Judgment.\n\n== Historical context ==\nAl-\u1e24\u0101qqa is a Meccan sura,<ref>Carl Ernst ''How to Read the Qur'an'' p. 216</ref> meaning it was revealed to the prophet while he lived in [[Mecca]] as opposed to [[Medina]].  Meccan suras divided into early, middle, and late periods.  [[Theodor N\u00f6ldeke]] in his chronology of suras places the sura to be revealed in the early Meccan period.\n\n== Theme and Subject Matter ==\nThe Surah tells about the destiny of [[Thamud]], [[\u02bf\u0100d]], [[Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]], other toppled towns, the flood that came in the hour of Prophet [[Noah in Islam|Noah]]. It discusses the prize of the steadfast and the punishment of the disbelievers. At last, it reminds the individuals that this message isn't the verse of a poet or something made up by the Prophet himself, it is the revelation of the Lord of the universes.<ref>Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiqi</ref> \n\n===Surat al-\u1e24\u0101qqah 69:1-3===\n{{Rquote|right| The Haqqah! What is the Haqqah? And what will make you understand what the Haqqah is? |[[Quran]] 69:1-3<ref>http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=69&verse=1</ref>}}\n\nThe first passage of the surah contains three ayaat. These 3 ayaat portray the day of resurrection and the day of judgement<ref name=\"asad\">[[Muhammad Asad]]</ref> and emphasize that The judgment of God will infallibly come.<ref name=sale>[[George Sale]]</ref> [http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(69:1:1) \"''Haaqqa''\"], referring to the Quranic view of the [[end time]] and [[Islamic eschatology|eschatology]]. \"''Haaqqa''\" has been translated to Reality<ref>[[Marmaduke Pickthall]]</ref>, Inevitable Hour<ref>Mustafa Khattab Translation</ref>, laying-bare of the truth<ref name=\"asad\"/>, etc. According to [[Ibn Kathir]], a [[Athari|traditionalistic]] exegete, [[Al-Haaqqa]] is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, like [[Al-Qaria]], At-Tammah, As-Sakhkhah and others.<ref>[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]]</ref> \n\nRhetorically [[Al-Haaqqa]] has 2 similarities with [[Al-Qaria]](101). Firstly the opening of the surah resembles [[Al-Qaria]](101) which opens with the wordings \n<br /><span style=\"color:black; font-size:165%;\">69:1 [http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(69:1:1) \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f] </span>\n<br /><span style=\"color:black; font-size:165%;\">69:2 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f</span>\n<br /><span style=\"color:black; font-size:165%;\">69:3 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f</span>\n\nNotice that Al-Qaria opens in exactly same style <ref>http://tanzil.net/#101:1</ref>\n<br /><span style=\"color:black; font-size:165%;\">101:1 [http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(101:1:1) \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f]  </span>\n<br /><span style=\"color:black; font-size:165%;\">101:2 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f</span>\n<br /><span style=\"color:black; font-size:165%;\">101:3 \u0648\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f</span>\n\nSecondly, word ''Al-Qaria'' appears as a total of 5 times in Quran and out of which thrice it is mentioned in [[Al-Qaria]](101) while once it appears in [[Al-Haaqqa]] as well.<ref>http://corpus.quran.com/wordmorphology.jsp?location=(69:4:4)</ref>\n\n===Surat al-\u1e24\u0101qqah 69:4-8===\n{{Rquote|right| (4)[[Thamud]] and [[\u02bf\u0100d]] denied the [[Al-Qaria|Striking Disaster]]. (5)As for [[Thamud]], they were destroyed by an overwhelming blast. (6)And as for [[\u02bf\u0100d]], they were destroyed by a furious, bitter wind. (7) which Allah unleashed on them non-stop for seven nights and eight days, so that you would have seen its people lying dead like trunks of uprooted palm trees. (8)Do you see any of them left alive? |[[Quran]] 69:4-8<ref name=\"question\">http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=69&verse=8</ref>}}\n\nThe 2nd passage of the surah contains 4 ayaat. These ayaat exemplify the history of ancient tribes [[Thamud]] and [[\u02bf\u0100d]]. Particulars of the pre-Islamic tribes of 'Ad and Thamud have been discussed in Quran elsewhere as well.<ref name=\"asad\"/><ref name=\"MOQ\">[[The Message of The Qur'an]]</ref> Mention of [[\u02bf\u0100d]] occurs 24 times<ref>http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEaAd2+pos%3Apn</ref> in total while the people of [[Thamud]] are mentioned 26 times<ref>http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3Avamuwd+pos%3Apn</ref> in the whole Quran. Both of these tribes rejected the Prophets so they were destroyed by the wrath of ALLAH.<ref name=\"sale\"/> The surah not only remind the history lesson but also re-narrate the specifics of how the final destruction was struck upon these aforementioned nations. Thus the tone of this surah displays the anger towards the attitude of disbelievers and the discourse makes it more and more clear as we move forward along the text. In 8th ayat, the Quran asks a direct emphatic question from the audience of the Quran, \"Do you see any of them left alive ?\"<ref name=\"question\"/>    \n\n===Surat al-\u1e24\u0101qqah 69:9-12===\n{{Rquote|right| (9)And the same crime was committed by Pharaoh and those before him and by the settlements that were overturned. (10)Such that they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord. So He gripped them with a grip ever-intensifying. (11)Indeed, when the floodwater had overflowed, We carried you in the floating Ark, (12)So that We may make this a reminder to you, and that attentive ears may grasp it. |[[Quran]] 69:9-12<ref>http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=69&verse=12</ref>}}\n\nThese 4 ayaat carry the continued tonality of warning by reminding examples and thus mention [[Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]]'s crime.<ref>http://tanzil.net/#69:9</ref> According to [[Tafsir]]s, the subverted cities mentioned in the 9th ayat refer to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] i.e the people of the prophet [[Lot in Islam|Lut]]. The text of the ayaat 11th and 12th are loaded with references, so their literal word to word translation needs adequate annotation. Rephrasing and aiding the original text with commentary illustrate the meanings as follows: ''\"Similarly, as a consequence of denying [[Noah in Islam|Noah]]\" when the flood rose high, it was We(ALMIGHTY) who carried you(your ancestors)<ref name=\"asad\"/><ref name=\"MOQ\"/><ref>Note:Cf.69:6</ref>{{refn|name=Note|group=N|metonymically in the consensus of all classical commentators}} upon the [[Noah's Ark|ark]].To make this \"account\" a reminder for you and that retaining ears may hear and retain it''.<ref name =Ghamdi>Translation and commentary by [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]]</ref>  Alluding to the punishment of evildoers and the saving grace bestowed upon the righteous.<ref name=\"asad\"/><ref name=\"MOQ\"/><ref>Note:Cf.69:7</ref> [[George Sale|Sale]] sums this up as; \"As the flood came, so shall the judgment certainly come\"<ref name=sale/><ref name=saleBook>Mohammed, A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran: Comprising Sale\u2019s Translation and Preliminary Discourse, with Additional Notes and Emendations (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, and Co., 1896). 4 vols.</ref>\n\n===Surat al-\u1e24\u0101qqah 69:13-18===\n{{Rquote|right| (13)And when the trumpet shall sound one blast; (14)And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one crash, (15)Then, on that day will the Event befall. (16)The sky will then be so torn that it will be frail, (17)And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne of their Lord that day, above them. (18)On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. |[[Quran]] 69:13-18<ref>http://tanzil.net/#69:18</ref>}}\n\nThe discourse of the surah now returns to the topic of opening ayaat. 1st three ayaat announced one of the names of [[Qiyamah]], asked what it is, and how would you know about it. Next 9 ayaat then reminded of (at least) 5 ancient nations, their negligence towards their [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Messengers]], and consequently their punishment. Notice that all of these were worldly punishments; before the [[Last Judgment]]. Now the imagery of [[Qiyamah]] and [[Afterlife]] is depicted in ayaat 13th to 37th.<ref>http://tanzil.net/#69:37</ref> Ayaat 13th to 17th features the ''affects'' of Trumpet of [[Israfil]] i.e; its single blow sound will cause cosmic chaos and catastrophe.

He would complain that his worldly wealth and authority is of no use now. Handing over the record in the left hand and his displayed lamentation will then be followed by the punishment of getting shackled in a chain whose length has been mentioned to be detrimental. And his sins are declared in 34th and 35th ayaat that he did not believe in ALLAH and did not encourage to feed the poor despite the fact he confessed to being a wealthy person in the previous ayat. Then the picturization of his punishment continues that neither he would have any company nor any food. The only food available for such people would be the pus of their own wounds. \n<blockquote>The actual word is \u063a\u0650\u0633\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u06cc\u06e1\u0646.

There are several English names under which the surah is known.  These include \u201cThe Inevitable Hour\u201d, \u201cThe Indubitable\u201d, \u201cThe Inevitable Truth\u201d, and \u201cThe Reality\u201d. These titles are derived from alternate translations of al-\u1e24\u0101qqa, the word that appears in the first three ayat of the sura. Though each of these titles may sound very different, each one alludes to the main theme of the sura \u2013 the Day of Judgment.\n\n== Historical context ==\nAl-\u1e24\u0101qqa is a Meccan sura,<ref>Carl Ernst ''How to Read the Qur'an'' p. 216</ref> meaning it was revealed to the prophet while he lived in [[Mecca]] as opposed to [[Medina]].  Meccan suras divided into early, middle, and late periods.  [[Theodor N\u00f6ldeke]] in his chronology of suras places the sura to be revealed in the early Meccan period.\n\n== Theme and Subject Matter ==\nThe Surah tells about the destiny of [[Thamud]], [[\u02bf\u0100d]], [[Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]], other toppled towns, the flood that came in the hour of Prophet [[Noah in Islam|Noah]]. It discusses the prize of the steadfast and the punishment of the disbelievers. At last, it reminds the individuals that this message isn't the verse of a poet or something made up by the Prophet himself, it is the revelation of the Lord of the universes.<ref>Dr. Muzammil H.

Both of these tribes rejected the Prophets so they were destroyed by the wrath of ALLAH.<ref name=\"sale\"/> The surah not only remind the history lesson but also re-narrate the specifics of how the final destruction was struck upon these aforementioned nations. Thus the tone of this surah displays the anger towards the attitude of disbelievers and the discourse makes it more and more clear as we move forward along the text. In 8th ayat, the Quran asks a direct emphatic question from the audience of the Quran, \"Do you see any of them left alive ?\"<ref name=\"question\"/>    \n\n===Surat al-\u1e24\u0101qqah 69:9-12===\n{{Rquote|right| (9)And the same crime was committed by Pharaoh and those before him and by the settlements that were overturned.

Next 9 ayaat then reminded of (at least) 5 ancient nations, their negligence towards their [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Messengers]], and consequently their punishment. Notice that all of these were worldly punishments; before the [[Last Judgment]]. Now the imagery of [[Qiyamah]] and [[Afterlife]] is depicted in ayaat 13th to 37th.<ref>http://tanzil.net/#69:37</ref> Ayaat 13th to 17th features the ''affects'' of Trumpet of [[Israfil]] i.e; its single blow sound will cause cosmic chaos and catastrophe. A picturesque depiction of mountains & earth lifted from their original space and then being smashed and destroyed, and sky being torn apart is portrayed.

He will be given his book in the left hand, he will be expressing his dejectedness by a deathwish of death which precedes with no accountability, he would express his feelings openly of not being aware of his account and accountability. He would complain that his worldly wealth and authority is of no use now. Handing over the record in the left hand and his displayed lamentation will then be followed by the punishment of getting shackled in a chain whose length has been mentioned to be detrimental. And his sins are declared in 34th and 35th ayaat that he did not believe in ALLAH and did not encourage to feed the poor despite the fact he confessed to being a wealthy person in the previous ayat. Then the picturization of his punishment continues that neither he would have any company nor any food. The only food available for such people would be the pus of their own wounds. \n<blockquote>The actual word is \u063a\u0650\u0633\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u06cc\u06e1\u0646. In the Arabic language, it is used for the fluid in which dirty and impure things are washed. It is evident from this that the very wealth of his that he had made filthy by not spending it for the cause of God will come before him on the Day of Judgement in the form of this fluid.

It has been used to make yarn, textiles and clothing for hundreds of years. Cashmere is closely associated with the [[Kashmir shawl]], the word \"cashmere\" deriving from an anglicisation of ''[[Kashmir]]'' when the Kashmir shawl reached Europe in the 19th century from [[Colonial India]]. Common usage defines the fiber as [[wool]], but it is finer, stronger, lighter, softer and approximately three times more insulating than [[sheep]] wool.<ref>Von Bergen, 1963</ref> Both the soft undercoat and the guard hairs may be used; the softer hair is reserved for textiles, while the coarse guard hair is used for brushes and other non-apparel purposes.\n\nA number of countries produce cashmere and have improved processing techniques over the years, but China and Mongolia are two of the leading producers as of 2019. Some yarns and clothing marketed as containing cashmere have been found to contain little to no cashmere fiber, so more stringent testing has been requested to make sure items are fairly represented.<ref name=\"Lanham\">{{cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/yarn-spun-advertising-not-tailored-to-lanham-act-claim|title=A Yarn Spun, But Advertising Not Tailored to a Lanham Act Claim|publisher=[[The National Law Review]]|last=Browning|first=John|date=October 21, 2015|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Crackdown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110375854829407721|title=The Cashmere Police Crack Down|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|last=Beatty|last2=Choi|first=Sally|first2=Hae Won|date=December 23, 2004|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHigh demand for the valuable fiber has resulted in the decimation and transformation of grasslands into deserts in Asia, increasing local temperatures and causing air pollution which has traveled to the Americas.<ref name=\"Chinadesert\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-china-cashmere-htmlstory-htmlstory.html|title=Your cheap sweater's real cost|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=Osnos|first=Evan|date=December 16, 2006|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Grassland\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/09/504118819/how-your-cashmere-sweater-is-decimating-mongolias-grasslands|title=How Your Cashmere Sweater Is Decimating Mongolia's Grasslands|last=Schmitz|first=Rob|work=[[NPR]]|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Sources  ==\n[[File:Pashmina goats.jpg|thumb|[[Pashmina goat]]s, [[Ladakh]], [[India]]]]\nCashmere wool fiber for clothing and other textile articles is obtained from the neck region of Cashmere and other goats. Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called ''Capra hircus laniger'', as if they were a subspecies of the domestic goat ''Capra hircus''. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies ''Capra aegagrus hircus'' or the alternate version ''Hircus Blythi Goat''. Cashmere goats produce a double [[Wool|fleece]] that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called [[guard hair]]. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting \"cashmere\" is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Gathering ==\n[[File:cashmeregoat shearing.png|thumb|right|Cashmere shearing. [[Corindhap, Victoria|Corindhap]], Australia.]]\nCashmere wool is collected during the spring [[moulting]] season when the goats naturally shed their winter coat. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the goats moult as early as March and as late as May.\n\nIn some regions, the mixed mass of down and coarse hair is removed by hand with a coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The collected fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, [[interfacing]]s and other non-apparel uses. Animals in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australian Cashmere goat|Australia]] are typically [[shorn]] of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, it is possible to comb the fibers out in about a week. The term \"baby cashmere\" is used for fibres harvested from younger goats, and has a reputation of being softer.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Shawl makers in Kashmir (1867).jpg|thumb|right|An 1867 [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] painting depicting men manufacturing [[shawl]]s using pashm wool]]\n\n[[China]] has become the largest producer of raw cashmere, estimated at 19,200 metric tons (in hair) per year(2016).

The annual world clip is estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000 tons (13,605 and 18,140 tonnes) (in hair). Pure cashmere, resulting from removing animal grease, dirt and coarse hairs from the fleece, is estimated at about 6,500 tons (5,895 tonnes). Ultra-fine Cashmere or [[Pashmina]] is still produced by communities in [[Kashmir]] but its rarity and high price, along with political instability in the region, make it very hard to source and to regulate quality. It is estimated that on average yearly production per goat is {{convert|150|g|lb}}.\n\nPure cashmere can be dyed and spun into yarns and [[knitted]] into [[Sweater|jumpers]] (sweaters), [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s, [[sock]]s and other clothing, or woven into [[fabric]]s then cut and assembled into garments such as outer [[coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[trousers]] (pants), [[pajamas]], [[scarf|scarves]], [[blanket]]s, and other items. Fabric and garment producers in [[Scotland]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] have long been known as market leaders. Cashmere may also be blended with other fibers to bring the garment cost down, or to gain their properties, such as elasticity from wool, or sheen from silk.\n\nThe town of [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]] was an incubator for the cashmere wool industry. It had the first power looms for woolens and the first manufacture of \"[[satinet]]s\". Capron Mill had the first power looms, in 1820. It burned on July 21, 2007, in the [[Bernat Mill]] fire.\n\nIn the United States, under the U.S. Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939, as amended, (15 U. S. Code Section 68b(a)(6)), a wool or textile product may be labelled as containing cashmere only if the following criteria are met:\n* such wool product is the fine (dehaired) [[down hair|undercoat]] fibers produced by a cashmere goat (''Capra hircus laniger'');\n* the average [[diameter]] of the fiber of such wool product does not exceed 19 [[micron]]s; and\n* such wool product does not contain more than 3 percent (by weight) of cashmere fibers with average diameters that exceed 30 microns.\n* The average fiber diameter may be subject to a [[coefficient of variation]] around the [[mean (average)|mean]] that shall not exceed 24 percent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 68) |url=https://www.ftc.gov/node/119457 |website=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=13 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Types of fiber ==\n* Raw \u2013 fiber that has not been processed and is essentially straight from the animal\n* Processed \u2013 fiber that has been through the processes of de-hairing, washing, carding, and is ready either to spin or to knit/crochet/weave\n* Virgin \u2013 new fiber made into yarns, fabrics, or garments for the first time\n* Recycled \u2013 fibers reclaimed from scraps or fabrics that were previously woven or felted, and may or may not have been previously used by the consumer from various parts of the world.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Boy's Frock LACMA M.2007.211.88 (1 of 10).jpg|thumb|right|A boy's [[frock]] produced circa 1855 in [[Kashmir]]; cashmere wool [[twill]] with silk embroidery and silk tassels.]]\n\nCashmere has been manufactured in [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Kashmir]] for thousands of years.

The down trade was controlled by treaties signed as a result of previous wars<ref>Bell, James (1829). ''A System of Geography Popular and Scientific or a Physical, Political and Statistical Account of the World and Its Various Divisions''.

The shawl's arrival is said to have created an immediate sensation and plans were put in place to start manufacturing the product in France.<ref>\"Cashmere\", ''The New American Cyclopedia'', IV (1861), p.514.</ref>\n\nIn 1799 at his factory in Reims, [[William-Louis Ternaux]], the leading woolens manufacturer in France under Napoleon, began to produce imitation India shawls (''cachemires'') using the wool of Spanish merino sheep. By 1811, with government assistance, Ternaux also began experimenting with the production of real India shawls using what he called  ''laine de Perse'', i.e., the down (''duvet'') of Tibetan-cashmere goats.<ref>Ternaux, William (1819). \"Notice sur l'importation en France des ch\u00e8vres \u00e0 laine de cachemire, originaires du Thibet\", ''Bulletin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'industrie,'' XVIII.</ref> In 1818, Ternaux resolved to help establish herds of cashmere goats in France. A famous expedition to Persia was organized, led by the orientalist and diplomat [[Pierre Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Jaubert]], to be financed in part by the French government. Of the acquired herd of 1,500 animals, only 256 arrived safely in the spring of 1819 at Marseilles and Toulon via the Crimea. About 100 of the cashmere goats were then purchased by the French government (at 2,000 francs each) and sent to the royal sheep farm at Perpignan. The remainder, about 180 including new-borns, went to Ternaux's property at [[Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine|Saint-Ouen]] outside Paris.<ref>Ternaux, William (1822). ''Recueil des pi\u00e8ces sur l'importation et naturalisation en France par MM. Ternaux et Jaubert des ch\u00e8vres de race thibetaine, ou ch\u00e8vres \u00e0 duvet de Cachemire''. Paris.</ref> Although Ternaux had little success getting small farmers to add cashmeres to their sheep herds, a few wealthy landowners were willing to experiment with the goats. For example, Ternaux's herd was seen in 1823 by C.T.Tower of Weald Hall, Essex, England.

Also, a few of Ternaux's goats were purchased for a model farm at Grignon, near [[Versailles]], run by M. Polonceau. Polonceau crossbred the cashmeres with Angora goats to improve the down for spinning and weaving. This Cashmere-Angora herd was seen by William Riley of New South Wales in 1828, and again in 1831 when Riley purchased thirteen of the goats for trans-shipment to Australia. At the time, the average production of the Polonceau herd was 16 ounces (500&nbsp;grams) of down. Ternaux's herd at St. Ouen still numbered 150 when the famous industrialist died in 1833.

It has been used to make yarn, textiles and clothing for hundreds of years. Cashmere is closely associated with the [[Kashmir shawl]], the word \"cashmere\" deriving from an anglicisation of ''[[Kashmir]]'' when the Kashmir shawl reached Europe in the 19th century from [[Colonial India]].

Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called ''Capra hircus laniger'', as if they were a subspecies of the domestic goat ''Capra hircus''. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies ''Capra aegagrus hircus'' or the alternate version ''Hircus Blythi Goat''. Cashmere goats produce a double [[Wool|fleece]] that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called [[guard hair]]. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting \"cashmere\" is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Gathering ==\n[[File:cashmeregoat shearing.png|thumb|right|Cashmere shearing. [[Corindhap, Victoria|Corindhap]], Australia.]]\nCashmere wool is collected during the spring [[moulting]] season when the goats naturally shed their winter coat. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the goats moult as early as March and as late as May.\n\nIn some regions, the mixed mass of down and coarse hair is removed by hand with a coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The collected fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, [[interfacing]]s and other non-apparel uses. Animals in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australian Cashmere goat|Australia]] are typically [[shorn]] of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, it is possible to comb the fibers out in about a week. The term \"baby cashmere\" is used for fibres harvested from younger goats, and has a reputation of being softer.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Shawl makers in Kashmir (1867).jpg|thumb|right|An 1867 [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] painting depicting men manufacturing [[shawl]]s using pashm wool]]\n\n[[China]] has become the largest producer of raw cashmere, estimated at 19,200 metric tons (in hair) per year(2016).

The annual world clip is estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000 tons (13,605 and 18,140 tonnes) (in hair). Pure cashmere, resulting from removing animal grease, dirt and coarse hairs from the fleece, is estimated at about 6,500 tons (5,895 tonnes). Ultra-fine Cashmere or [[Pashmina]] is still produced by communities in [[Kashmir]] but its rarity and high price, along with political instability in the region, make it very hard to source and to regulate quality. It is estimated that on average yearly production per goat is {{convert|150|g|lb}}.\n\nPure cashmere can be dyed and spun into yarns and [[knitted]] into [[Sweater|jumpers]] (sweaters), [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s, [[sock]]s and other clothing, or woven into [[fabric]]s then cut and assembled into garments such as outer [[coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[trousers]] (pants), [[pajamas]], [[scarf|scarves]], [[blanket]]s, and other items. Fabric and garment producers in [[Scotland]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] have long been known as market leaders. Cashmere may also be blended with other fibers to bring the garment cost down, or to gain their properties, such as elasticity from wool, or sheen from silk.\n\nThe town of [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]] was an incubator for the cashmere wool industry. It had the first power looms for woolens and the first manufacture of \"[[satinet]]s\". Capron Mill had the first power looms, in 1820. It burned on July 21, 2007, in the [[Bernat Mill]] fire.\n\nIn the United States, under the U.S. Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939, as amended, (15 U. S. Code Section 68b(a)(6)), a wool or textile product may be labelled as containing cashmere only if the following criteria are met:\n* such wool product is the fine (dehaired) [[down hair|undercoat]] fibers produced by a cashmere goat (''Capra hircus laniger'');\n* the average [[diameter]] of the fiber of such wool product does not exceed 19 [[micron]]s; and\n* such wool product does not contain more than 3 percent (by weight) of cashmere fibers with average diameters that exceed 30 microns.\n* The average fiber diameter may be subject to a [[coefficient of variation]] around the [[mean (average)|mean]] that shall not exceed 24 percent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 68) |url=https://www.ftc.gov/node/119457 |website=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=13 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Types of fiber ==\n* Raw \u2013 fiber that has not been processed and is essentially straight from the animal\n* Processed \u2013 fiber that has been through the processes of de-hairing, washing, carding, and is ready either to spin or to knit/crochet/weave\n* Virgin \u2013 new fiber made into yarns, fabrics, or garments for the first time\n* Recycled \u2013 fibers reclaimed from scraps or fabrics that were previously woven or felted, and may or may not have been previously used by the consumer from various parts of the world.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Boy's Frock LACMA M.2007.211.88 (1 of 10).jpg|thumb|right|A boy's [[frock]] produced circa 1855 in [[Kashmir]]; cashmere wool [[twill]] with silk embroidery and silk tassels.]]\n\nCashmere has been manufactured in [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Kashmir]] for thousands of years.

A famous expedition to Persia was organized, led by the orientalist and diplomat [[Pierre Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Jaubert]], to be financed in part by the French government. Of the acquired herd of 1,500 animals, only 256 arrived safely in the spring of 1819 at Marseilles and Toulon via the Crimea. About 100 of the cashmere goats were then purchased by the French government (at 2,000 francs each) and sent to the royal sheep farm at Perpignan. The remainder, about 180 including new-borns, went to Ternaux's property at [[Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine|Saint-Ouen]] outside Paris.<ref>Ternaux, William (1822).

Madhavan]] and written by Bala Murugan. The film stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[Jayalalitha]]. The film deals with Kalpana, an urban woman who marries a villager Mookaiyan. After marriage, differences of opinion arise between the couple as Mookaiyan raises objections about city culture, leading to their separation. The rest of the film shows whether Kalpana reforms and the couple are united or not.\n\n''Pattikada Pattanama'' was released on 6 May 1972. The film was commercially successful, running for over 175 days in theatres, thereby becoming a [[silver jubilee film]]. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil]] (Jayalalithaa).\n\n== Plot ==\nMookkaiyan belongs to a well-to-do family and lives in the village Sozhavandan. He is held in high esteem by the villagers for his prowess. One day, his uncle Chockalingam, Chockalingam's wife Bama and their foreign-educated daughter Kalpana come to Sozhavandan to participate in the [[Mariamman]] festival. Kalpana is fascinated by Mookaiyan's prowess; her mother disapproves of Kalpana's emotional reaction while her father is happy. Bama settles a young man of Madurai to marry Kalpana. Moved by the pleas of Chockalingam, Mookaiyan goes to the bridegroom's house and brings back Kalpana, saying that he has the right by birth to marry her.\n\nMarried life starts well for Mookaiyan and Kalpana, but before long differences arise because of their different backgrounds. At Kalpana's birthday party, Mookaiyan objects to drinking and dancing by her [[hippie]] friends. He beats Kalpana, and she leaves him to join her mother. A lawyer's notice for divorce is received. Mookaiyan futilely tries to make Bama understand the situation. The mother and daughter are adamant and Mookaiyan returns home determined to teach them a lesson.\n\nKalpana, having been impregnated by Mookaiyan some time earlier, gives birth to a child. In her anxiety to save Kalpana from further involvements, Bama leaves the child in an orphanage. Kalpana is shocked by this act of her mother. By the time she goes to recover the child, Mookaiyan has already taken it away. Kalpana beseeches her father to get the child from Mookaiyan. Unexpectedly, Mookaiyan comes there to deliver an invitation card for his marriage with his cousin Rakkamma. Kalpana and her parents are now repentant.\n\nKalpana goes alone to Mookaiyan's house and asks her husband to leap over their child and then tie the ''[[Mangala sutra|thali]]'' to another girl. To her surprise, Kalpana discovers that the marriage being celebrated is that of a different man named Mookaiyan, while her husband did no injustice to her; she falls at her husband's feet and the family reunites.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Mookkaiyan Servai / Mukesh<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://theekkathir.in/2014/10/15/%E0%AE%89%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%88-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%95/ |title=\u0b89\u0bb2\u0b95\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc8 \u0b95\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd: \u0b85\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bcd 15 \u0b95\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u2013 \u0b8e\u0bb8\u0bcd.\u0bb5\u0bbf. \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba9\u0bcd |date=15 October 2014 |work=[[Theekkathir]] |access-date=11 December 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323182923/http://theekkathir.in/2014/10/15/%e0%ae%89%e0%ae%b2%e0%ae%95%e0%ae%95%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%95%e0%af%88-%e0%ae%95%e0%ae%b4%e0%af%81%e0%ae%b5%e0%af%81%e0%ae%a4%e0%ae%b2%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%a8%e0%ae%be%e0%ae%b3%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%85%e0%ae%95/ |archive-date=23 March 2016 |language=ta}}</ref>\n* [[Jayalalitha]] as Kalpana<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Off-screen-deity-on-screen-goddess/article16772323.ece |title=Off-screen deity, on-screen goddess |last=Rangan |first=Baradwaj |date=7 December 2016 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=11 December 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211031425/http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Off-screen-deity-on-screen-goddess/article16772323.ece |archive-date=11 December 2016 |author-link=Baradwaj Rangan}}</ref>\n* [[Shubha (actress)|Shubha]] as Rakkamma\n* [[V.

Madhavan]] and written by Bala Murugan. The film stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[Jayalalitha]]. The film deals with Kalpana, an urban woman who gets married to a villager Mookaiyan. After marriage, differences of opinion arise between the couple as Mookaiyan raises objections about city culture, leading to their separation. The rest of the film shows whether Kalpana reforms and the couple are united or not.\n\n''Pattikada Pattanama'' was released on 6 May 1972. The film was commercially successful, running for over 175 days in theatres, thereby becoming a [[silver jubilee film]]. It also won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Tamil|Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil]] (Jayalalithaa).\n\n== Plot ==\nMookkaiyan belongs to a well-to-do family and lives in the village Sozhavandan. He is held in high esteem by the villagers for his prowess. One day, his uncle Chockalingam, Chockalingam's wife Bama and their foreign-educated daughter Kalpana come to Sozhavandan to participate in the [[Mariamman]] festival. Kalpana is fascinated by Mookaiyan's prowess; her mother disapproves of Kalpana's emotional reaction while her father is happy. Bama settles a young man of Madurai to marry Kalpana. Moved by the pleas of Chockalingam, Mookaiyan goes to the bridegroom's house and brings back Kalpana, saying that he has the right by birth to marry her.\n\nMarried life starts well for Mookaiyan and Kalpana, but before long differences arise because of their different backgrounds. At Kalpana's birthday party, Mookaiyan objects to drinking and dancing by her [[hippie]] friends. He beats Kalpana, and she leaves him to join her mother. A lawyer's notice for divorce is received. Mookaiyan futilely tries to make Bama understand the situation. The mother and daughter are adamant and Mookaiyan returns home determined to teach them a lesson.\n\nKalpana, having been impregnated by Mookaiyan some time earlier, gives birth to a child. In her anxiety to save Kalpana from further involvements, Bama leaves the child in an orphanage. Kalpana is shocked by this act of her mother. By the time she goes to recover the child, Mookaiyan has already taken it away. Kalpana beseeches her father to get the child from Mookaiyan. Unexpectedly, Mookaiyan comes there to deliver an invitation card for his marriage with his cousin Rakkamma. Kalpana and her parents are now repentant.\n\nKalpana goes alone to Mookaiyan's house and asks her husband to leap over their child and then tie the ''[[Mangala sutra|thali]]'' to another girl. To her surprise, Kalpana discovers that the marriage being celebrated is that of a different man named Mookaiyan, while her husband did no injustice to her; she falls at her husband's feet and the family reunites.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Mookkaiyan Servai / Mukesh <ref>{{Cite news |url=https://theekkathir.in/2014/10/15/%E0%AE%89%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%88-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%95/ |title=\u0b89\u0bb2\u0b95\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc8 \u0b95\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd: \u0b85\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bcd 15 \u0b95\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u2013 \u0b8e\u0bb8\u0bcd.\u0bb5\u0bbf. \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcb\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba9\u0bcd |date=15 October 2014 |work=[[Theekkathir]] |access-date=11 December 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323182923/http://theekkathir.in/2014/10/15/%e0%ae%89%e0%ae%b2%e0%ae%95%e0%ae%95%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%95%e0%af%88-%e0%ae%95%e0%ae%b4%e0%af%81%e0%ae%b5%e0%af%81%e0%ae%a4%e0%ae%b2%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%a8%e0%ae%be%e0%ae%b3%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%85%e0%ae%95/ |archive-date=23 March 2016 |language=ta}}</ref>\n* [[Jayalalitha]] as Kalpana<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Off-screen-deity-on-screen-goddess/article16772323.ece |title=Off-screen deity, on-screen goddess |last=Rangan |first=Baradwaj |date=7 December 2016 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=11 December 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211031425/http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Off-screen-deity-on-screen-goddess/article16772323.ece |archive-date=11 December 2016 |author-link=Baradwaj Rangan}}</ref>\n* [[Shubha (actress)|Shubha]] as Rakkamma\n* [[V.

Most historians agree that the geopolitical differences between the Soviet Union and the Axis made war inevitable, and that Stalin had made extensive preparations for war and exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage. [[Viktor Suvorov]] has argued that Stalin planned to attack Hitler from behind while Germany fought the Allies, and ''Barbarossa'' was a [[preemptive strike]] by Hitler. Many historians have written in response to Suvorov's views. [[Gabriel Gorodetsky]] and [[David Glantz]] authored books debunking his claims.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Evan Mawdsley.

He argued that Soviet ground forces were well-organized and mobilized ''en masse'' along the [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty|German\u2013Soviet frontier]] for a Soviet invasion of Europe slated for Sunday, July 6, 1941 but were unprepared to defend their own territory.\n\nOne of Suvorov's pieces of evidence favoring the theory of an impending Soviet attack was his claim regarding the maps and phrasebooks issued to Soviet troops. Military topographic maps, unlike other military supplies, are strictly local and cannot be used elsewhere than in the intended operational area. Suvorov claims Soviet units were issued with maps of Germany and German-occupied territory, and phrasebooks including questions about [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] offices\u2014SA offices were found only in German territory proper. In contrast, maps of Soviet territory were scarce. Notably, after the German attack, the officer responsible for maps, Lieutenant General M.K. Kudryavtsev, was not punished by Stalin, who was known for extreme punishments after failures to obey his orders. According to Suvorov, this demonstrates that Kudryavtsev ''was'' obeying the orders of Stalin, who simply did not expect a German attack.<ref>Suvorov, Viktor.

Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2008.</ref>\n\nSuvorov offers as another piece of evidence the extensive effort Stalin took to conceal general mobilization by manipulating the laws setting the [[Conscription in Russia|conscription]] age. That allowed Stalin to provide the expansive build-up of the Red Army. Since there was no universal military draft in the Soviet Union until 1939, by enacting the universal military draft on 1 September 1939 (the date [[World War II]] had begun), and by changing the minimum age for joining the Red Army from 21 to 18, Stalin triggered a mechanism which achieved a dramatic increase in the military strength of the Red Army.\n\nThis specific law on mobilization allowed the Red Army to increase its army of 1,871,600 men in 1939 to 5,081,000 in the spring of 1941 under secrecy to avoid alarming the rest of the world.<ref>V. Suvorov, ''The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War 2'' Naval Institute Press (2008)</ref> Eighteen million reservists were also drafted.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The duration of service was 2 years. Thus, according to supporters of this theory, the Red Army had to enter a war by 1 September 1941 or the drafted soldiers would have to be released from service.\n\n=== Points ===\nSuvorov's main points include the following:\n\n* The Soviet Union was intrinsically unstable. It had to expand to survive. According to Suvorov's interpretation of the [[permanent revolution]] theory, the communist system had to expand and occupy the entire world to survive. Otherwise, the system would fail in a peaceful and/or military struggle with surrounding \"capitalist\" countries. Stalin and other Soviet leaders opposed this and high-ranking officials who supported \"permanent revolution\" were purged from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of the Soviet Union. Stalin publicly declared that \"the ultimate victory of socialism... can only be achieved on an international scale\".<ref name=\"ACT 1997, pages 75-76\">''[[Pravda]]'', February 14, 1938, cited from V. Suvorov ''Last Republic'' ({{lang|ru|\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430}}), ACT, 1997, {{ISBN|5-12-000367-2}}, pages 75\u201376</ref> Under this theory, Soviet leaders therefore started preparations for a large-scale war of aggression. They officially declared an adherence to the theory of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\", according to which Socialism can win in a single country, without being immediately overthrown by hostile capitalist neighbors. This leading country would then help revolutionary movements in other countries. Either way, the Soviet pre-war doctrine was based on the [[Marxism-Leninism]] theory that [[capitalism]] will be overthrown through [[Communist revolution]].\n* The Soviet Union made extensive preparations for a future war of aggression during the 1920s and 1930s. Suvorov provides an extensive analysis of Stalin's preparations for war. According to Suvorov, there were supposed to be three [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] phases that would prepare the Soviet Union for war. The first one was to be focused on [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]], the second focused on industrialisation, and the third phase would emphasize the militarisation of the country.\n* Stalin escalated tensions in Europe by providing a combination of economic and military support to [[Weimar Germany]], and later to [[Nazi Germany]] (see [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941]]). After World War I, the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] attempted to impose severe restrictions on Weimar Germany to prevent it from rearming and again becoming a significant military competitor. During \"the early 1920s until 1933, the Soviet Union was engaged in secret collaboration with the German military to enable it to circumvent the provisions of the [[Versailles Treaty]]\", which limited Germany's military production.<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> Moscow allowed the Germans to produce and test their weapons on Soviet territory, while some Red Army officers attended general-staff courses in Germany.<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> The basis for this collaboration was the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]], signed between the two nations in 1922, and subsequent diplomatic interactions. This collaboration ended when the anti-communist Nazis took power in 1933. But, according to Suvorov, in the years 1932\u20131933, \"Stalin helped Hitler come to power by forbidding [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communists]] to make common cause with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] against the Nazis in parliamentary elections\".<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> Suvorov claims that Stalin's plan and vision was that Hitler's predictability and his violent reactionary ideas made him a candidate for the role of \"[[:wikt:icebreaker|icebreaker]]\" for the Communist revolution. By starting wars with European countries, Hitler would validate the USSR's entry into World War II by attacking Nazi Germany and \"liberating\" and Sovietising all of Europe. When concluding the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939, Stalin \"clearly counted on the repetition of the [[World War I|1914\u20131918]] [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], which would leave the \"capitalist\" countries so exhausted that the USSR could sweep into Europe virtually unopposed\"<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> (see also [[Stalin's speech on August 19, 1939]]).\n* According to Suvorov and others, Stalin always planned to exploit military conflict between the capitalist countries to his advantage. He said as early as 1925 that \"Struggles, conflicts and wars among our enemies are...our great ally...and the greatest supporter of our government and our revolution\" and \"If a war does break out, we will not sit with folded arms \u2013 we will have to take the field, but we will be ''last'' to do so. And we shall do so in order to throw the decisive load on the scale\".<ref name=\"Pipes\">[[Richard Pipes]] ''Communism: A History'' (2001) {{ISBN|0-8129-6864-6}}, pages 74\u201375.</ref>\n* World War II was initiated by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which became co-belligerents after signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. The essence of this pact was in the secret protocols which divided Europe into spheres of influence, and removed the Polish buffer between Germany and the USSR. Some countries that fell into the Soviet [[sphere of influence]] \u2013 [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] \u2013 were [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupied]]. The difference between these smaller nations, occupied and annexed by the USSR, and Poland (which was [[Invasion of Poland|initially attacked by Germany]]) was that Poland had military assistance guarantees from [[Great Britain]] and [[France]].\n* Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany from the rear in July 1941, only a few weeks after the date on which the [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union took place. According to Suvorov, the Red Army had already redeployed from a defensive to an offensive stance. Suvorov also states that Stalin had made no major defensive preparations.\n* Hitler's intelligence identified the USSR's preparations to attack Germany. Therefore, the Wehrmacht had drafted a [[preemptive war]] plan based on Hitler's orders as early as mid-1940, soon after the Soviet annexations of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]]. On June 22, 1941, the Axis began an assault on the USSR.\n\n== Reactions and critiques ==\n\nWhile most agree that Stalin made extensive preparations for an eventual war and that he exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage, the assertions that Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941, and that [[Operation Barbarossa]] was a preemptive strike by Hitler, are generally discounted.<ref name=\"Glantz, David M. 1998, p. 4\">Glantz, David M., ''Stumbling Colossus: The Red Army on the Eve of War'', Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 1998, {{ISBN|0-7006-0879-6}} p. 4.</ref>\n\nIn some countries, particularly in Russia, Germany, and Israel, Suvorov's thesis has jumped the bonds of academic discourse and captured the imagination of the public.<ref name=\"undricks\"/> Among the noted critics of Suvorov's work are Israeli historian [[Gabriel Gorodetsky]], American military historian [[David Glantz]],<ref>David M.

The book is also based on open-source, unclassified literature, and recently declassified materials. Based on this material, Hoffmann argues that the Soviet Union was making final preparations for its own attack when the Wehrmacht struck. Danilov and [[Heinz Magenheimer]] examined this plan and other documents in the early 1990s, which might indicate Soviet preparations for an attack.

Most historians agree that the geopolitical differences between the Soviet Union and the Axis made war inevitable, and that Stalin had made extensive preparations for war and exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage. [[Viktor Suvorov]] has argued that Stalin planned to attack Hitler from behind while Germany fought the Allies, and ''Barbarossa'' was a [[preemptive strike]] by Hitler. Many historians have written in response to Suvorov's views. [[Gabriel Gorodetsky]] and [[David Glantz]] authored books debunking his claims.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Evan Mawdsley.

Uldricks. The Icebreaker Controversy: Did Stalin Plan to Attack Hitler? ''Slavic Review'', Vol. 58, No. 3 (Autumn, 1999), pp. 626-643</ref> Some [[Wehrmacht]] leaders (including [[Wilhelm Keitel]]) supported this view after the Second World War.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Mineau.

Beattie. ''Icebreaker: who started the Second World War?'' Hamish Hamilton, 1990. {{ISBN|0-241-12622-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-241-12622-6}}.</ref> and again in several subsequent books. He argued that Soviet ground forces were well-organized and mobilized ''en masse'' along the [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty|German\u2013Soviet frontier]] for a Soviet invasion of Europe slated for Sunday, July 6, 1941 but were unprepared to defend their own territory.\n\nOne of Suvorov's pieces of evidence favoring the theory of an impending Soviet attack was his claim regarding the maps and phrasebooks issued to Soviet troops. Military topographic maps, unlike other military supplies, are strictly local and cannot be used elsewhere than in the intended operational area. Suvorov claims Soviet units were issued with maps of Germany and German-occupied territory, and phrasebooks including questions about [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] offices\u2014SA offices were found only in German territory proper. In contrast, maps of Soviet territory were scarce. Notably, after the German attack, the officer responsible for maps, Lieutenant General M.K. Kudryavtsev, was not punished by Stalin, who was known for extreme punishments after failures to obey his orders. According to Suvorov, this demonstrates that Kudryavtsev ''was'' obeying the orders of Stalin, who simply did not expect a German attack.<ref>Suvorov, Viktor. ''The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II''. Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2008.</ref>\n\nSuvorov offers as another piece of evidence the extensive effort Stalin took to conceal general mobilization by manipulating the laws setting the [[Conscription in Russia|conscription]] age. That allowed Stalin to provide the expansive build-up of the Red Army. Since there was no universal military draft in the Soviet Union until 1939, by enacting the universal military draft on 1 September 1939 (the date [[World War II]] had begun), and by changing the minimum age for joining the Red Army from 21 to 18, Stalin triggered a mechanism which achieved a dramatic increase in the military strength of the Red Army.\n\nThis specific law on mobilization allowed the Red Army to increase its army of 1,871,600 men in 1939 to 5,081,000 in the spring of 1941 under secrecy to avoid alarming the rest of the world.<ref>V. Suvorov, ''The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War 2'' Naval Institute Press (2008)</ref> Eighteen million reservists were also drafted.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} The duration of service was 2 years. Thus, according to supporters of this theory, the Red Army had to enter a war by 1 September 1941 or the drafted soldiers would have to be released from service.\n\n=== Points ===\nSuvorov's main points include the following:\n\n* The Soviet Union was intrinsically unstable. It had to expand to survive. According to Suvorov's interpretation of the [[permanent revolution]] theory, the communist system had to expand and occupy the entire world to survive. Otherwise, the system would fail in a peaceful and/or military struggle with surrounding \"capitalist\" countries. Stalin and other Soviet leaders opposed this and high-ranking officials who supported \"permanent revolution\" were purged from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of the Soviet Union. Stalin publicly declared that \"the ultimate victory of socialism... can only be achieved on an international scale\".<ref name=\"ACT 1997, pages 75-76\">''[[Pravda]]'', February 14, 1938, cited from V. Suvorov ''Last Republic'' ({{lang|ru|\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430}}), ACT, 1997, {{ISBN|5-12-000367-2}}, pages 75\u201376</ref> Under this theory, Soviet leaders therefore started preparations for a large-scale war of aggression. They officially declared an adherence to the theory of \"[[Socialism in One Country]]\", according to which Socialism can win in a single country, without being immediately overthrown by hostile capitalist neighbors. This leading country would then help revolutionary movements in other countries. Either way, the Soviet pre-war doctrine was based on the [[Marxism-Leninism]] theory that [[capitalism]] will be overthrown through [[Communist revolution]].\n* The Soviet Union made extensive preparations for a future war of aggression during the 1920s and 1930s. Suvorov provides an extensive analysis of Stalin's preparations for war. According to Suvorov, there were supposed to be three [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] phases that would prepare the Soviet Union for war. The first one was to be focused on [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]], the second focused on industrialisation, and the third phase would emphasize the militarisation of the country.\n* Stalin escalated tensions in Europe by providing a combination of economic and military support to [[Weimar Germany]], and later to [[Nazi Germany]] (see [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941]]). After World War I, the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] attempted to impose severe restrictions on Weimar Germany to prevent it from rearming and again becoming a significant military competitor. During \"the early 1920s until 1933, the Soviet Union was engaged in secret collaboration with the German military to enable it to circumvent the provisions of the [[Versailles Treaty]]\", which limited Germany's military production.<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> Moscow allowed the Germans to produce and test their weapons on Soviet territory, while some Red Army officers attended general-staff courses in Germany.<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> The basis for this collaboration was the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]], signed between the two nations in 1922, and subsequent diplomatic interactions. This collaboration ended when the anti-communist Nazis took power in 1933. But, according to Suvorov, in the years 1932\u20131933, \"Stalin helped Hitler come to power by forbidding [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communists]] to make common cause with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] against the Nazis in parliamentary elections\".<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> Suvorov claims that Stalin's plan and vision was that Hitler's predictability and his violent reactionary ideas made him a candidate for the role of \"[[:wikt:icebreaker|icebreaker]]\" for the Communist revolution. By starting wars with European countries, Hitler would validate the USSR's entry into World War II by attacking Nazi Germany and \"liberating\" and Sovietising all of Europe. When concluding the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939, Stalin \"clearly counted on the repetition of the [[World War I|1914\u20131918]] [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], which would leave the \"capitalist\" countries so exhausted that the USSR could sweep into Europe virtually unopposed\"<ref name=\"Pipes\" /> (see also [[Stalin's speech on August 19, 1939]]).\n* According to Suvorov and others, Stalin always planned to exploit military conflict between the capitalist countries to his advantage. He said as early as 1925 that \"Struggles, conflicts and wars among our enemies are...our great ally...and the greatest supporter of our government and our revolution\" and \"If a war does break out, we will not sit with folded arms \u2013 we will have to take the field, but we will be ''last'' to do so. And we shall do so in order to throw the decisive load on the scale\".<ref name=\"Pipes\">[[Richard Pipes]] ''Communism: A History'' (2001) {{ISBN|0-8129-6864-6}}, pages 74\u201375.</ref>\n* World War II was initiated by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which became co-belligerents after signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. The essence of this pact was in the secret protocols which divided Europe into spheres of influence, and removed the Polish buffer between Germany and the USSR. Some countries that fell into the Soviet [[sphere of influence]] \u2013 [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] \u2013 were [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupied]]. The difference between these smaller nations, occupied and annexed by the USSR, and Poland (which was [[Invasion of Poland|initially attacked by Germany]]) was that Poland had military assistance guarantees from [[Great Britain]] and [[France]].\n* Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany from the rear in July 1941, only a few weeks after the date on which the [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion of the Soviet Union took place. According to Suvorov, the Red Army had already redeployed from a defensive to an offensive stance. Suvorov also states that Stalin had made no major defensive preparations.\n* Hitler's intelligence identified the USSR's preparations to attack Germany. Therefore, the Wehrmacht had drafted a [[preemptive war]] plan based on Hitler's orders as early as mid-1940, soon after the Soviet annexations of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]]. On June 22, 1941, the Axis began an assault on the USSR.\n\n== Reactions and critiques ==\n\nWhile most agree that Stalin made extensive preparations for an eventual war and that he exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage, the assertions that Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941, and that [[Operation Barbarossa]] was a preemptive strike by Hitler, are generally discounted.<ref name=\"Glantz, David M. 1998, p. 4\">Glantz, David M., ''Stumbling Colossus: The Red Army on the Eve of War'', Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 1998, {{ISBN|0-7006-0879-6}} p. 4.</ref>\n\nIn some countries, particularly in Russia, Germany, and Israel, Suvorov's thesis has jumped the bonds of academic discourse and captured the imagination of the public.<ref name=\"undricks\"/> Among the noted critics of Suvorov's work are Israeli historian [[Gabriel Gorodetsky]], American military historian [[David Glantz]],<ref>David M.

Providing additional support for this thesis is that no significant defense plans have been found.<ref>Meltyukhov 2000:375</ref> In his argument, Meltyukhov covers five different versions of the assault plan (\"Considerations on the Strategical Deployment of Soviet Troops in Case of War with Germany and its Allies\" [http://osteuropa.bsb-muenchen.de/dig/1000doktest/0024_zuk/@Generic__BookTextView/502;cs=default;ts=default;pt=502 (Russian original)]), the first version of which was developed soon after the outbreak of World War II.

He argues that in the Russian archives there are five versions of the general plan for the strategic deployment of the Red Army and ten documents reflecting the development of plans for operational deployment of western military districts. The differences between them were slight, all documents (including operational maps signed by the Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Red Army) are the plans for the invasion with depth offensive 300&nbsp;km. Solonin also states that no other plans for Red Army deployment in 1941 have been found so far,<ref>[http://www.solonin.org/en/article_comrade-stalins-three-plans Comrade Stalin's Three Plans -Mark Solonin's article on his personal website]</ref> and that the concentration of Red Army units in Western parts of USSR was done in direct accordance with the May \"Considerations on plan for strategic deployment\":\n\n'''Planned and actual Red Army deployment on the Soviet Western Border'''\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\"Considerations\", May 41\n! \"Reference\", June 13\n!

The book is also based on open-source, unclassified literature, and recently declassified materials. Based on this material, Hoffmann argues that the Soviet Union was making final preparations for its own attack when the Wehrmacht struck. Danilov and [[Heinz Magenheimer]] examined this plan and other documents in the early 1990s, which might indicate Soviet preparations for an attack. Both researchers came to the conclusion that Zhukov's plan of May 15, 1941 reflected [[Stalin's alleged speech of 19 August 1939]] heralding the birth of the new offensive Red Army. <ref>''Austrian military journal'' (''\u00d6sterreichische Milit\u00e4rische Zeitschrift'', nos. 5 and 6, 1991; no. 1, 1993; and no. 1, 1994).</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a collection of articles (entitled ''The Truth of Viktor Suvorov'') by various historians who share some views with Suvorov was published.<ref>\u0425\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 (\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442.).

On August 20, 2004, historian and former [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] [[Mart Laar]] published an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' titled ''When Will Russia Say 'Sorry'?''. In this article, he said: \"The new evidence shows that by encouraging Hitler to start World War II, Stalin hoped to simultaneously ignite a [[world revolution|world-wide revolution]] and conquer all of Europe\". Another former statesman to share his views of a purported Soviet aggressive plan is former president of Finland [[Mauno Koivisto]], who wrote: \"It seems to be clear the Soviet Union was not ready for defense in the summer of 1941, but it was rather preparing for an assault.... The forces mobilized in the Soviet Union were not positioned for defensive, but for offensive aims.\" Koivisto concludes: \"Hitler's invasion forces didn't outnumber [the Soviets], but were rather outnumbered themselves. The Soviets were unable to organize defenses. The troops were provided with maps that covered territories outside the Soviet Union.\"<ref name=\"koivisto\">Koivisto, M.
