His views were shaped by his time in the porn industry, in which he worked for nine years, and led him to view its effect as detrimental to persons involved.<ref name=cbn>{{cite web| last =Smith| first =Tim| title =Donny's Escape from Pornography| work =CBN| url =http://www.cbn.com/700club/features/amazing/jts9_donny_pauling.aspx| access-date =2014-07-18| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140725183521/http://www.cbn.com/700club/features/amazing/jts9_donny_pauling.aspx| archive-date =2014-07-25| url-status=live| df =}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Pauling admitted to engaging in sex with three teenage girls from 2012 to 2014, \"motivated by an unnatural or abnormal interest in children,\" according to his plea. He [[plea bargain|pleaded]] [[no contest]] and agreed to a 6-year prison sentence.\n\n==Early life==\nPauling was born the son of a [[Pentecostal]] pastor. He has stated that his strong Christian upbringing is what began to turn him away from Christianity. When he was a senior in high school he moved into his aunt's home in another city to take an advanced math class. It was here he met his future wife, Wendy, who was a devout Christian. He would eventually reconvert to Christianity. They dated for many years before finally marrying. Pauling has stated that it was during this time, when he lived with his young wife, that they purchased a computer and he began his fascination with pornography. Eventually he decided he somehow wanted a career making pornography and founded Pauling Technology Consulting.<ref name=cbn/>\n\n==Career in pornography==\nPauling Technology Consulting was founded in 1997 to create pornographic content to be licensed by other larger companies. He funded this side business all through his own money he had saved up. For the first three years of his career, it was a side business of his that earned him extra income. When he eventually told his wife about his activities, the marriage fell apart and he moved into his office. When he began doing his porn career full-time, the first month he brought in over $50,000.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free>{{cite web| last =Jalsevac| first =John| title =From Playboy Pornographer to Christian pastor: the unlikely story of Donny Pauling| work =Free Republic| date =Mar 21, 2012| url =http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/2861984/posts| access-date =2014-07-18| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015519/http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/2861984/posts| archive-date =2015-09-24| url-status=live| df =}}</ref>\n\nHe began at first taking photos of young women, ultimately filming scenes of both \"hardcore\" and \"softcore\" pornography. He created content with pornographic models and actresses that he then published under contract for larger porn sites. One of his largest and most lucrative contracts was with [[Playboy]], with whom he worked for many years.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/>\n\nFor several years he was averaging an income of around half a million dollars. Pauling stated that he was deeply immersed in the lifestyle, wealth, and affluence that came with his career. He claims it further pushed him away from his family and Christianity.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/> He again fell out of Christianity at this time, developing a hatred for it. Part of this hatred, he has stated, stemmed from Christian groups protesting against his work or outside porn conventions telling him he was \"going to hell\".<ref name=free/>\n\nPauling routinely advertised his content on Christian web pages and forums, since he saw them as 'hypocrites' and 'sexually repressed'. He has claimed that it was on these databases and forums that he received some of his greatest number of clients.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/>\n\nDespite his continuing and successful career he began to despise the man he had become. He has stated that late in his career, many of the women he had recruited into the industry had contacted him in the hopes of having their Internet content taken down, although he lacked the authority to do so. He has also stated that several of these women had careers and relationships ruined due to their involvement in pornography.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/>\n\n===XXX Church===\nIn 2006, while entering the [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo|Las Vegas Porn Convention]], and after being accosted by Christian protesters, he took notice of a sign for [[XXXchurch.com|XXXChurch]], a church group preaching acceptance of any and all persons, including porn-industry workers. He had previously been introduced to XXCChurch in 2002, but it had not taken serious steps into joining until then. XXXChurch, headed by [[Craig Gross]] became very popular at porn conventions, brothels, strip clubs, etc. Pauling became interested in this group, as it preached tolerance for all. \u201cThe Christians I grew up around would never talk to a porn producer, much less broadcast it to their listeners...But they were doing things in such a different way. They were actually loving people. It was such a non-confrontational approach. I couldn't help but say, if I was going to be a Christian, this is the kind of Christian I\u2019d want to be.\u201d<ref name=cbn/>\n\nAt first he was antagonistic towards the group, calling them 'hypocrites' and posting online comments such as \"God does not exist\". However, over time he became more open and accepting of the group. He eventually would become more active in it, eventually joining and deciding to reconvert once more.<ref name=free/>\n\nHe had begun to detest the lifestyle and affects pornography had on his life.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/>\n\n===Leaving the industry===\nDue to his reconversion into Christianity, he began second-guessing his career in pornography. He was offered a new, very lucrative contract by Playboy. At first he intended to accept the offer, believing that his Christian faith and a porn career were compatible. However, after what he claims to be an intervention by God, he decided that he could no longer stay in the industry.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/>\n\nSoon after he partially reconciled with his wife, although they remain divorced. Quitting the industry, he suddenly had much less income. However the family received large donations from various Christian charities and Pauling has stated that all his hatred of Christianity melted then.<ref name=free/>\n\nHe has lamented at the number of women he had previously recruited or worked with who have since contacted him depicting their regret and shame at having done porn.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/>\n\n==Anti-porn activism==\nPauling soon after began taking seminary classes to become a Pastor. He viewed his previous life in porn production and use as an addiction and began speaking about it. With the help of Craig Gross and XXXChurch, he started an outreach that spoke about the dangers of pornography from multiple points of view.<ref name=free/> Pauling said that pornography was addictive and that the industry was harmful to women.<ref name=cbn/> As a Christian, he believed it to be sinful.<ref name=cbn/><ref name=free/> Pauling has expressed the view that pornography use can lead to other more serious vices including sex trafficking.<ref name=free/><ref name=wusa>{{cite web| last =McCarren| first =Andrea| title =Former pornography producer speaks candidly about industry| work =WUSA9| date =May 16, 2014| url =http://www.wusa9.com/story/news/local/2014/05/15/donny-pauling-recruited-500-actresses-most-in-college/9144769/| access-date =2014-07-18| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140726202122/http://www.wusa9.com/story/news/local/2014/05/15/donny-pauling-recruited-500-actresses-most-in-college/9144769/| archive-date =July 26, 2014| url-status =dead| df =}}</ref>\n\n===Guilty Pleasure===\nPauling spoke at the Guilty Pleasure conference in [[Melbourne, Australia]].
