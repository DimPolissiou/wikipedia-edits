Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of [[Christianization of Iberia]] (not to be confused with the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), a core Georgian kingdom of [[Kartli]].{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King [[Mirian III of Iberia|Mirian III]] (326 or 337) and the [[Bir el Qutt inscriptions]] of 430,{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} contemporaneously with the [[Armenian alphabet]].{{sfn|West|2010|p=230|ps=: Archaeological work in the last decade has confirmed that a Georgian alphabet did exist very early in Georgia's history, with the first examples being dated from the '''fifth century''' C.E.}} It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into [[Old Georgian language|Georgian]], by monks in Georgia and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].<ref name=Lig1 /> Professor [[Levan Chilashvili]]'s dating of fragmented ''Asomtavruli'' inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of [[Nekresi]], in Georgia's easternmost province of [[Kakheti]], in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been accepted.{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=19|ps=: footnote 43: \"The date of the supposed grave marker is hopelessly circumstantial ...

According to medieval Armenian sources and a number of scholars, [[Mesrop Mashtots]], generally acknowledged as the creator of the [[Armenian alphabet]], also created the Georgian and [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet]]s.

Consequently, scribal manipulation reflecting post-schism (especially anti-Georgian) attitudes potentially contaminates all MSS copied after that time.

In the early stages of the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in [[cinnabar]] ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] era, when the styles of the [[Byzantine Empire]] influenced [[Kingdom of Georgia]], capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.<ref>\u10d4\u10da\u10d4\u10dc\u10d4 \u10db\u10d0\u10ed\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8, \u10d4\u10dc\u10ea\u10d8\u10d9\u10da\u10dd\u10de\u10d4\u10d3\u10d8\u10d0 \u201e\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d4\u10dc\u10d0\u201c, \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8, 2008, \u10d2\u10d5. 403\u2013404</ref>\n\n<center>[[File:Asomtavruli letter \u10db.png|110px]] [[File:Asomtavruli letter \u10dc (n).png|110px]] [[File:Asomtavruli letter \u10d7 (t).png|110px]]<br/><small>Decorative Asomtavruli capital letters, [[wikt:\u10db|\u10db]] (m), [[wikt:\u10dc|\u10dc]] (n) and [[wikt:\u10d7|\u10d7]] (t), 12\u201313th century.</small></center>\n\nFrom the 11th-century \"limb-flowery\", \"limb-arrowy\" and \"limb-spotty\" decorative forms of Asomtavruli are developed.

Mkhedruli, literally meaning \"[[cavalry]]\" or \"[[military]]\", derives from ''mkhedari'' (\u10db\u10ee\u10d4\u10d3\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8) meaning \"[[Equestrianism|horseman]]\", \"[[knight]]\", \"[[warrior]]\"{{sfn|Nakanishi|1990|p=22}} and \"[[cavalier]]\".{{sfn|Allen|Gugushvili|1937|p=324}}\n\nMkhedruli is bicameral, with capital letters that are called Mkhedruli Mtavruli ({{lang|ka|\u10db\u10ee\u10d4\u10d3\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8}}) or simply Mtavruli ({{lang|ka|\u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8}}; {{IPA-ka|mt\u02b0\u0251vruli}}). Nowadays, Mtavruli is typically used in [[all-caps]] text in titles or to emphasize a word, though in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was occasionally used, as in Latin and Cyrillic scripts, to capitalize proper nouns or the first word of a sentence.<ref name=\"Unicode Mtavruli proposal\" />\n\nMkhedruli first appears in the 10th century. The oldest Mkhedruli inscription is found in [[Ateni Sioni Church]] dating back to 982 AD. The second oldest Mkhedruli-written text is found in the 11th-century royal charters of King [[Bagrat IV of Georgia]]. Mkhedruli was mostly used then in the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for the [[royal charter]]s, historical documents, manuscripts and inscriptions.<ref>\u10d0\u10e2\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e3\u10ea\u10dc\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8 \u10ec\u10d0\u10e0\u10ec\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8, \u10d0\u10d1\u10e0\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, \u10d2\u10d5. 170-1</ref> Mkhedruli was used for non-religious purposes only and represented the \"civil\", \"royal\" and \"secular\" script.{{sfn|Katzner|Miller|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Chambers Encyclopedia|1901|p=165}}\n\nMkhedruli became more and more dominant over the two other scripts, though Khutsuri (Nuskhuri with Asomtavruli) was used until the 19th century. Mkhedruli became the universal writing Georgian system outside of the Church in the 19th century with the establishment and development of printed Georgian fonts.<ref name=\"Putkaradze2006\" />\n\n===Form of Mkhedruli letters===\nMkhedruli inscriptions of the 10th and 11th centuries are characterized in rounding of angular shapes of Nuskhuri letters and making the complete outlines in all of its letters. Mkhedruli letters are written in the four-linear system, similar to Nuskhuri.\nMkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing. It breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets, Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri.

Even when all three are written, they're generally not all the same size, as they are in print, but rather riding on one wide arc like two dimples in it.\n* Rarely, <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10dd</span> (''oni'') is written as a [[right angle]], [[File:Oni (other form).svg|10px]].\n* <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10e0</span> (''rae'') is frequently written with one arc, [[File:Rae (other form).svg|10px]], like a Latin {{angbr|h}}.\n* <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10e2</span> (''t'ari'') often has a small circle with a tail hanging into the bowl, rather than two small circles as in print, or as an O with a straight vertical line intersecting the top.  It may also be rotated a bit clockwise, with the small circles further to the right and not as close to the top.\n* <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10ec</span> (''ts'ili'') is generally written with a round bowl at the bottom, [[File:Ts'ili (other form).svg|12px]].

Traditionally, Asomtavruli was used for chapter or section titles, where Latin script might use bold or italic type.\n\n== Punctuation ==\nIn Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation, various combinations of dots were used as [[word divider]]s and to separate phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of 5th to 10th centuries, these were written as dashes, like \u2212, = and =\u2212. In the 10th century, clusters of one (\u00b7), two (:), three ([[wikt:\u10fb|\u10fb]]) and six (\u10fb\u10fb) dots (later sometimes small circles) were introduced by [[Ephrem Mtsire]] to indicate increasing breaks in the text. One dot indicated a \"minor stop\" (presumably a simple word break), two dots marked or separated \"special words\", three dots for a \"bigger stop\" (such as the [[appositive]] name and title \"the sovereign Alexander\", below, or [[#Gospel of Matthew|the title of the Gospel of Matthew]], above), and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence. Starting in the 11th century, marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use. An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word, and a comma appeared at the end of an interrogative sentence. From the 12th century on, these were replaced with the semicolon (the [[Greek question mark]]). In the 18th century, Patriarch [[Anton I of Georgia]] reformed the system again, with commas, single dots, and double dots used to mark \"complete\", \"incomplete\", and \"final\" sentences, respectively.<ref>[[Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia]], V. 8, p. 231, Tbilisi, 1984</ref> For the most part, Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the [[Latin script]].{{sfn|Gillam|2003|p=252}}\n\n<center>[[File:Alexander II signature.svg|center|180px]]\n<small>Signature of King [[Alexander II of Kakheti]], with the divider {{angbr|\u10fb}}<br>\u10f4\u10da\u10db\u10ec\u10d8\u10e4\u10d4 \u10fb \u10d0\u10da\u10d4\u10e5\u10e1\u10d0\u10dc\u10d3\u10e0\u10d4<br>\"The sovereign Alexander\"</small></center>\n\n== Summary ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Wikipedia puzzle globe on the wall of the Wikimedia Foundation, 2010-10-26.jpg\n| width1    = 250\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = The Georgian letter {{angbr|\u10d5}} is on the [[Logo of Wikipedia|Wikipedia logo]] (lower left).\n| image2    = 0873 - Kaukasus 2014 - Georgien - Batumi (17349857412).jpg\n| width2    = 250\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = The [[Alphabetic Tower]] seen on panorama of Georgia's port city of [[Batumi]].\n}}\nThis table lists the three scripts in parallel columns, including the letters that are now obsolete in all alphabets (shown with a blue background), obsolete in Georgian but still used in other alphabets (green background), or additional letters in languages other than Georgian (pink background).

Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are [[unicase]], their [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s share the same names and alphabetical order, and are written horizontally from [[Writing system#Directionality|left to right]]. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli, once the civilian royal script of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and mostly used for the [[royal charter]]s, is now the standard script for modern Georgian and its related [[Kartvelian languages]], whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only by the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], in ceremonial religious texts and [[Iconography#Christian iconography|iconography]].<ref name=\"addit\"/>\n\nGeorgian scripts are unique in their appearance and their exact origin has never been established; however, in strictly structural terms, their [[alphabetical order]] largely corresponds to the [[Greek alphabet]], with the exception of letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end.{{sfn|Shanidze|2000|p=444}}<ref name=Lig1 /> Originally consisting of 38 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]],{{sfn|Machavariani|2011| p= 329}} Georgian is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are obsolete in that language.

[[Laz language|Laz]] uses the same 33 current Georgian letters as Mingrelian plus that same obsolete letter and a letter borrowed from [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] for a total of 35.

Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of [[Christianization of Iberia]] (not to be confused with the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), a core Georgian kingdom of [[Kartli]].{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King [[Mirian III of Iberia|Mirian III]] (326 or 337) and the [[Bir el Qutt inscriptions]] of 430,{{sfn|Hewitt|1995|p=4}} contemporaneously with the [[Armenian alphabet]].{{sfn|West|2010|p=230|ps=: Archaeological work in the last decade has confirmed that a Georgian alphabet did exist very early in Georgia's history, with the first examples being dated from the '''fifth century''' C.E.}} It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into [[Old Georgian language|Georgian]], by monks in Georgia and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].<ref name=Lig1 /> Professor [[Levan Chilashvili]]'s dating of fragmented ''Asomtavruli'' inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of [[Nekresi]], in Georgia's easternmost province of [[Kakheti]], in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been accepted.{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=19|ps=: footnote 43: \"The date of the supposed grave marker is hopelessly circumstantial ... I cannot support Chilashvili's dubious hypothesis.\"}}\n\nA Georgian tradition first attested in the medieval chronicle ''Lives of the Kings of Kartli'' (ca. 800),<ref name=Lig1 /> assigns a much earlier, pre-Christian origin to the Georgian alphabet, and names King [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia|Pharnavaz I]] (3rd century BC) as its inventor. This account is now considered legendary, and is rejected by scholarly consensus, as no archaeological confirmation has been found.<ref name=Lig1 />{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|p=}}{{sfn|Rapp|2010|p=139}} Rapp considers the tradition to be an attempt by the Georgian Church to rebut the earlier tradition that the alphabet was invented by the Armenian scholar [[Mesrop Mashtots]], and is a Georgian application of an Iranian model in which primordial kings are credited with the creation of basic social institutions.{{sfn|Rapp|2006|p=38}} Georgian linguist [[Tamaz Gamkrelidze]] offers an alternative interpretation of the tradition, in the pre-Christian use of foreign scripts (alloglottography in the [[Aramaic alphabet]]) to write down Georgian texts.{{sfn| Kemertelidze|1999|pp=228-}}\n\nAnother point of contention among scholars is the role played by [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian clerics]] in that process. According to medieval Armenian sources and a number of scholars, [[Mesrop Mashtots]], generally acknowledged as the creator of the [[Armenian alphabet]], also created the Georgian and [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet]]s. This tradition originates in the works of [[Koryun]], a fifth-century historian and biographer of Mashtots,<ref name=\"Mashtots\" /> and has been quoted by [[Donald Rayfield]] and [[James R. Russell]],{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|p=19|ps=: \"The Georgian alphabet seems unlikely to have a pre-Christian origin, for the major archaeological monument of the 1st century 4IX the bilingual Armazi gravestone commemorating Serafua, daughter of the Georgian viceroy of Mtskheta, is inscribed in Greek and Aramaic only.

Significantly, all of the extant MSS containing The Life of Mashtoc* were copied centuries after the split. Consequently, scribal manipulation reflecting post-schism (especially anti-Georgian) attitudes potentially contaminates all MSS copied after that time. It is therefore conceivable, though not yet proven, that valuable information about Georgia transmitted by pre-schism Armenian texts was excised by later, post-schism individuals.\"}} or concede that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must have played a role in the creation of the Georgian script.<ref name=Lig1/>{{sfn|Rapp|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Greppin|1981|pp=449\u2013456}}\n\nAnother controversy regards the main influences at play in the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the [[Greek alphabet]], or by Semitic alphabets such as [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]].{{sfn|Kemertelidze|1999|pp=228-}} Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters.{{sfn|Shanidze|2000|p=444}}<ref name=Lig1 /> Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.{{sfn|Haarmann|2012|p=299}}\n\n== ''Asomtavruli'' ==\n[[File:X \u10e1\u10d0\u10e3\u10d9\u10e3\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10e1\u10dd\u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8.jpg|thumb|Manuscript in Asomtavruli, 10th century.]]\n'''Asomtavruli''' ({{lang-ka|\u10d0\u10e1\u10dd\u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8}}; {{IPA-ka|\u0251s\u0254mt\u02b0\u0251vruli}}) is the oldest Georgian script.

Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] era, when the styles of the [[Byzantine Empire]] influenced [[Kingdom of Georgia]], capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.<ref>\u10d4\u10da\u10d4\u10dc\u10d4 \u10db\u10d0\u10ed\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8, \u10d4\u10dc\u10ea\u10d8\u10d9\u10da\u10dd\u10de\u10d4\u10d3\u10d8\u10d0 \u201e\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d4\u10dc\u10d0\u201c, \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8, 2008, \u10d2\u10d5. 403\u2013404</ref>\n\n<center>[[File:Asomtavruli letter \u10db.png|110px]] [[File:Asomtavruli letter \u10dc (n).png|110px]] [[File:Asomtavruli letter \u10d7 (t).png|110px]]<br/><small>Decorative Asomtavruli capital letters, [[wikt:\u10db|\u10db]] (m), [[wikt:\u10dc|\u10dc]] (n) and [[wikt:\u10d7|\u10d7]] (t), 12\u201313th century.</small></center>\n\nFrom the 11th-century \"limb-flowery\", \"limb-arrowy\" and \"limb-spotty\" decorative forms of Asomtavruli are developed.

Even when all three are written, they're generally not all the same size, as they are in print, but rather riding on one wide arc like two dimples in it.\n* Rarely, <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10dd</span> (''oni'') is written as a [[right angle]], [[File:Oni (other form).svg|10px]].\n* <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10e0</span> (''rae'') is frequently written with one arc, [[File:Rae (other form).svg|10px]], like a Latin {{angbr|h}}.\n* <span style=\"font-size:170%;\">\u10e2</span> (''t'ari'') often has a small circle with a tail hanging into the bowl, rather than two small circles as in print, or as an O with a straight vertical line intersecting the top.

Traditionally, Asomtavruli was used for chapter or section titles, where Latin script might use bold or italic type.\n\n== Punctuation ==\nIn Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation, various combinations of dots were used as [[word divider]]s and to separate phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of 5th to 10th centuries, these were written as dashes, like \u2212, = and =\u2212. In the 10th century, clusters of one (\u00b7), two (:), three ([[wikt:\u10fb|\u10fb]]) and six (\u10fb\u10fb) dots (later sometimes small circles) were introduced by [[Ephrem Mtsire]] to indicate increasing breaks in the text. One dot indicated a \"minor stop\" (presumably a simple word break), two dots marked or separated \"special words\", three dots for a \"bigger stop\" (such as the [[appositive]] name and title \"the sovereign Alexander\", below, or [[#Gospel of Matthew|the title of the Gospel of Matthew]], above), and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence. Starting in the 11th century, marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use. An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word, and a comma appeared at the end of an interrogative sentence. From the 12th century on, these were replaced with the semicolon (the [[Greek question mark]]). In the 18th century, Patriarch [[Anton I of Georgia]] reformed the system again, with commas, single dots, and double dots used to mark \"complete\", \"incomplete\", and \"final\" sentences, respectively.<ref>[[Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia]], V. 8, p. 231, Tbilisi, 1984</ref> For the most part, Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the [[Latin script]].{{sfn|Gillam|2003|p=252}}\n\n<center>[[File:Alexander II signature.svg|center|180px]]\n<small>Signature of King [[Alexander II of Kakheti]], with the divider {{angbr|\u10fb}}<br>\u10f4\u10da\u10db\u10ec\u10d8\u10e4\u10d4 \u10fb \u10d0\u10da\u10d4\u10e5\u10e1\u10d0\u10dc\u10d3\u10e0\u10d4<br>\"The sovereign Alexander\"</small></center>\n\n== Summary ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Wikipedia puzzle globe on the wall of the Wikimedia Foundation, 2010-10-26.jpg\n| width1    = 250\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = The Georgian letter {{angbr|\u10d5}} is on the [[Logo of Wikipedia|Wikipedia logo]] (lower left).\n| image2    = 0873 - Kaukasus 2014 - Georgien - Batumi (17349857412).jpg\n| width2    = 250\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = The [[Alphabetic Tower]] seen on panorama of Georgia's port city of [[Batumi]].\n}}\nThis table lists the three scripts in parallel columns, including the letters that are now obsolete in all alphabets (shown with a blue background), obsolete in Georgian but still used in other alphabets (green background), or additional letters in languages other than Georgian (pink background).
