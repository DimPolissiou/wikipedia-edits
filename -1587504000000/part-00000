These symptoms may include a white or gray film on the body. \n\n==Prevention==\nDisease cures are almost always more expensive and less effective than simple prevention measures.  Often precautions involve maintaining a stable aquarium that is adjusted for the specific species of fish that are kept and not over-crowding a tank or over-feeding the fish.  Common preventive strategies include avoiding the introduction of infected fish, invertebrates or plants by [[Quarantine|quarantining]] new additions before adding them to an established tank, and discarding water from external sources rather than  mixing it with clean water.  Similarly, foods for [[Herbivory|herbivorous fish]] such as [[lettuce]] or [[cucumber]]s should be washed before being placed in the tank.  Containers that do not have [[Filter (water)|water filters]] or [[pump]]s to circulate water can also increase stress to fish.  Other stresses on fish and tanks can include certain chemicals, [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s, and impacts to tank walls causing [[shock wave]]s that can damage fish.\n\n==Treatment==\nIn some cases the causes of an infection or disease will be obvious (such as fin rot), though in other cases it may be due to water conditions, requiring special testing equipment and chemicals to appropriately adjust the water.  Isolating diseased fish can help prevent the spread of infection to healthy fish in the tank.  This also allows the use of chemicals or drugs which may damage the nitrogen cycle, plants or chemical filtration of a properly-functioning tank.  Other alternatives include short baths in a bucket that contains the treated water.  Salt baths can be used as an [[antiseptic]] and [[fungicide]], and will not damage beneficial bacteria, though ordinary table salt may contain additives which can harm fish.  Alternatives include aquarium salt, [[Kosher salt]] or [[rock salt]].  Gradually raising the temperature of the tank may kill certain parasites, though some diseased fish may be harmed and certain species can not tolerate high temperatures.  Aeration is necessary since less oxygen is dissolved in warm water.\n\nThere are a number of effective treatments for many strains of [[bacterial infection]]s. Three of the most common are [[tetracycline]], [[penicillin]] and naladixic acid.

This fine was levied because some products on Amazon.ca were shown with an artificially high \"list price\", making the lower selling price appear to be very attractive, producing an unfair competitive edge over other retailers.

Amazon argued that this was to prevent \"customer confusion\", as these devices do not support the [[Prime Video]] ecosystem. This move was criticized, as commentators believed that it was meant primarily to [[Protectionism|suppress]] the sale of products deemed as competition to [[Amazon Fire TV]] products, given that Amazon itself had deliberately refused to offer software for its own streaming services on these devices, and the action contradicted the implication that Amazon.com was a general online retailer.<ref name=\"nyt-amazonstopselling\">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Stop Selling Apple TV and Chromecast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/business/amazon-to-stop-selling-apple-tv-and-chromecast.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 October 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=\"bloomberg-ccban\">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Ban Sale of Apple, Google Video-Streaming Devices\n|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices|accessdate=1 October 2015|work=Bloomberg News|date=October 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"wired-appletvban\">{{cite news|title=Amazon Is Banning Apple TV and Chromecast.

This move was criticized, as commentators believed that it was meant primarily to [[Protectionism|suppress]] the sale of products deemed as competition to [[Amazon Fire TV]] products, given that Amazon itself had deliberately refused to offer software for its own streaming services on these devices, and the action contradicted the implication that Amazon.com was a general online retailer.<ref name=\"nyt-amazonstopselling\">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Stop Selling Apple TV and Chromecast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/business/amazon-to-stop-selling-apple-tv-and-chromecast.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 October 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=\"bloomberg-ccban\">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Ban Sale of Apple, Google Video-Streaming Devices\n|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices|accessdate=1 October 2015|work=Bloomberg News|date=October 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"wired-appletvban\">{{cite news|title=Amazon Is Banning Apple TV and Chromecast.
