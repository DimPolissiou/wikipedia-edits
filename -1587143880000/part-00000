Later [[Enrique Bunbury]] joined the line-up. Bunbury was originally a bass player but after Juan Valdivia heard him sing a [[David Bowie]] song, Bunbury became the vocalist.\n\nThe band changed their name in 1985 to H\u00e9roes del Silencio. At first they played in public places and made demo recordings but their breakthrough came when they participated in a music contest in [[Salamanca]] and won second place. An [[EMI]] producer, Gustavo Montesano, saw the band in the contest and at a later concert in Sala En Bruto, he signed the band.\n\nTheir first EP, ''[[H\u00e9roe de Leyenda]]'', was released in 1987 and sold 30,000 copies. The following year, the album ''[[El Mar No Cesa]]'' was released, featuring the songs \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/mar-adentro/?modal Mar Adentro]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/agosto/?modal Agosto]\" and \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/el-estanque/?modal El Estanque]\", and sold 100,000 copies. The supporting tour followed in 1989, documented on the limited edition live album ''[[En Directo (EP)|En Directo]]''.\n\nIn 1990 they released ''[[Senderos de Traici\u00f3n]]'', their best-selling album with 2 million copies, including 400,000 copies in the first two weeks in Spain alone. The following year they started the tour ''Senda 91'' and released another live album, ''[[Senda '91]]''. In 1993 the band released the most important CD in their career, ''[[El Esp\u00edritu del Vino]]''. 600,000 copies of this album, which was played throughout America, were sold. They followed this with a tour for ''El Esp\u00edritu del Vino''. In 1993, [[Alan Boguslavsky]] joined the band.\n\nDue to tensions within the band, H\u00e9roes del Silencio took a hiatus and went to [[Benasque]] to take a vacation and heal the rifts within the group. After this break they acquired a new producer, [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Lou Reed]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], etc.) and in 1995 released ''[[Avalancha]]''. ''Avalancha'' was more [[hard rock]] than the previous albums, with songs like \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/avalancha/?modal Avalancha]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/deshacer-el-mundo/?modal Deshacer el Mundo]\" and \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/iberia-sumergida/?modal Iberia Sumergida]\". The album was followed by the Avalancha tour in 1995 and 1996, which produced the live album \"[[Parasiempre|Para siempre]]\".\n\nThe band split in 1996, though this did not stop the release of the album ''[[Rarezas]]'' in 1998.\n\n===Albums and tours===\nIn 1988 H\u00e9roes recorded their first full-length album. ''[[El Mar No Cesa]]'' was a limited edition and all copies (30,000) were sold. The album was more pop-oriented than the band had originally wished, which made them perform live in a slightly more aggressive way so as to show the real potential of the band. A limited live album ''En Directo'' was later released capturing the energy of their concerts. In 1990 they went into the studio once again to work with producer [[Phil Manzanera]] on their second album, ''[[Senderos de Traici\u00f3n]]''.<ref name=allmusic>{{allmusic|class=album|id=r290478 |label=Senderos de Traicion |first=Jon |last= O'Brien |accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 ''Senderos de Traici\u00f3n'' was a successful second release for Heroes, \"combining Celtic guitars [and] metal rhythms.\"<ref name=allmusic/> The songs \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/entre-dos-tierras/?modal Entre Dos Tierras]\" and \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/maldito-duende/?modal Maldito Duende]\" are still among the most popular of the band. The album was recorded in London, including English versions of \"Entre Dos Tierras\" and \"Maldito Duende\". It was decided though to not publish them. The tour for this album was called ''Senda'' like the song of the same name. It took the band to America and to various European countries including Germany and Belgium; winning several gold discs on their way. According to Bunbury, the tour represented the golden times of the band.<ref>{{cite book |title=H\u00e9roes del silencio : Senderos de traici\u00f3n |language=Spanish |first=Nuria |last=Tes\u00f3n |first2=Dar\u00edo |last2=Manrique N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first3=Diego A. |last3=Manrique |author4=H\u00e9roes del Silencio |publisher=Diario El Pa\u00eds |location=Madrid |year=2007 |isbn=9788498158373 |page=21}}</ref> The live album ''[[Senda 91']]'' was produced on this tour.

The singles from the release were \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/nuestros-nombres/?modal Nuestros Nombres]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/flor-de-loto/?modal Flor de Loto]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/los-placeres-de-la-pobreza/?modal Los Placeres De La Pobreza]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/la-sirena-varada/?modal La Sirena Varada]\" and \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/la-herida/?modal La Herida]\" The album features hard rock and has a style similar to rock bands like [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Cult]], [[The Mission (band)|The Mission]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]] and [[Guns N'Roses|Guns N' Roses]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The songs \"Nuestros Nombres\" and \"La Herida\" reached position one in several European charts.{{which|date=March 2011}} Alan Boguslavsky joined the band in the tour named ''[[El Camino Del Exceso]]'', during which they played in countries including Germany, Austria, Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, U.S.A, Chile, Finland and Hungary.

The rest of the songs on the album got in the Top 10 of \"Los 40 Principales\" and on [[MTV]].\n\n\"El Camino Del Exceso\" meant in many ways the loss of compatibility between Bunbury and Valdivia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn 1995 H\u00e9roes met [[Bob Ezrin]], who produced the album ''[[Avalancha]]''. This album was a new commercial success for the H\u00e9roes. Alan Boguslavsky, baptized \"el Azteca de oro\" ({{lang-es|The Golden Aztec}}), entered the band officially, being credited as co-composer of several songs although he did not appear in the promotional photos for the album. The album has a stronger [[Rock music|rock]] style than any others before. Songs like \"Iberia Sumergida\" and \"La Chispa Adecuada\" came into the first position of the lists. The title track, \"Avalancha\", came in the first positions of charts like MTV. The tour was the most extensive one of the band. The final concert of H\u00e9roes del Silencio was meant to take place in Los Angeles but it was canceled because the crowd was angry at the band after rumors of their split.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} H\u00e9roes said goodbye in Spain with the mythical phrase: \"''Nos vemos en la gira del proximo milenio. Hasta Siempre'' [See you on tour in the next millennium. Farewell].\".\n\n==Consecration and separation==\nAt the ''Avalancha'' tour, the band participated in the [[Monsters of Rock]] of Brasil in 1996 as headliners. The concert was not recorded. The H\u00e9roes also got a special in MTV, like Unplugged and Gustock.\n\nThe \"Tour macrogira Avalancha\" from July 1995 to October 1996 led them to give 152 concerts in Europe and America. The coexistence during that time was difficult, and fatigue lead to increased internal conflicts. During this development, Bunbury started his own compositions and recorded new songs, hinting that his future was already far from H\u00e9roes del Silencio. Their last concert was in Los Angeles on 6 October 1996.\n\nBefore concluding the tour, and in a press conference in [[Lima]], Peru, H\u00e9roes del Silencio reported their temporary separation. Apart from its environment, the news was surprising, but eventually came to transcend some of the reasons that had led to such a situation. The musical differences, especially between Juan and Enrique, had led them to a distance, and these differences became personal. The deaths of two persons very close to the group as well influenced the band's spirit: their road manager Martin Druille in 1993, and Enrique's brother, Rafael, in 1994. As remarked by Bunbury, the last months of the tour were an ordeal for him.\n\n===2007 Reunion tour===\n[[File:Heroes del Silencio Sevilla Oct 07 2.jpg|thumb|right|H\u00e9roes playing in Sevilla on October 2007]]\n20 years after their first album, and 11 years after they split up, the band announced a ten-day reunion tour that would take them to [[Guatemala City]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Monterrey]], [[Ciudad de M\u00e9xico]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sevilla]], [[Zaragoza]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].

The album was followed by the Avalancha tour in 1995 and 1996, which produced the live album \"[[Parasiempre|Para siempre]]\".\n\nThe band split in 1996, though this did not stop the release of the album ''[[Rarezas]]'' in 1998.\n\n===Albums and tours===\nIn 1988 H\u00e9roes recorded their first full-length album. ''[[El Mar No Cesa]]'' was a limited edition and all copies (30,000) were sold. The album was more pop-oriented than the band had originally wished, which made them perform live in a slightly more aggressive way so as to show the real potential of the band. A limited live album ''En Directo'' was later released capturing the energy of their concerts. In 1990 they went into the studio once again to work with producer [[Phil Manzanera]] on their second album, ''[[Senderos de Traici\u00f3n]]''.<ref name=allmusic>{{allmusic|class=album|id=r290478 |label=Senderos de Traicion |first=Jon |last= O'Brien |accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 ''Senderos de Traici\u00f3n'' was a successful second release for Heroes, \"combining Celtic guitars [and] metal rhythms.\"<ref name=allmusic/> The songs \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/entre-dos-tierras/?modal Entre Dos Tierras]\" and \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/maldito-duende/?modal Maldito Duende]\" are still among the most popular of the band. The album was recorded in London, including English versions of \"Entre Dos Tierras\" and \"Maldito Duende\". It was decided though to not publish them. The tour for this album was called ''Senda'' like the song of the same name. It took the band to America and to various European countries including Germany and Belgium; winning several gold discs on their way. According to Bunbury, the tour represented the golden times of the band.<ref>{{cite book |title=H\u00e9roes del silencio : Senderos de traici\u00f3n |language=Spanish |first=Nuria |last=Tes\u00f3n |first2=Dar\u00edo |last2=Manrique N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first3=Diego A. |last3=Manrique |author4=H\u00e9roes del Silencio |publisher=Diario El Pa\u00eds |location=Madrid |year=2007 |isbn=9788498158373 |page=21}}</ref> The live album ''[[Senda 91']]'' was produced on this tour.

The singles from the release were \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/nuestros-nombres/?modal Nuestros Nombres]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/flor-de-loto/?modal Flor de Loto]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/los-placeres-de-la-pobreza/?modal Los Placeres De La Pobreza]\", \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/la-sirena-varada/?modal La Sirena Varada]\" and \"[http://heroesdelsilencio.es/letras/la-herida/?modal La Herida]\" The album features hard rock and has a style similar to rock bands like [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Cult]], [[The Mission (band)|The Mission]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]] and [[Guns N'Roses|Guns N' Roses]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The songs \"Nuestros Nombres\" and \"La Herida\" reached position one in several European charts.{{which|date=March 2011}} Alan Boguslavsky joined the band in the tour named ''[[El Camino Del Exceso]]'', during which they played in countries including Germany, Austria, Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, U.S.A, Chile, Finland and Hungary.

The rest of the songs on the album got in the Top 10 of \"Los 40 Principales\" and on [[MTV]].\n\n\"El Camino Del Exceso\" meant in many ways the loss of compatibility between Bunbury and Valdivia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn 1995 H\u00e9roes met [[Bob Ezrin]], who produced the album ''[[Avalancha]]''. This album was a new commercial success for the H\u00e9roes. Alan Boguslavsky, baptized \"el Azteca de oro\" ({{lang-es|The Golden Aztec}}), entered the band officially, being credited as co-composer of several songs although he did not appear in the promotional photos for the album. The album has a stronger [[Rock music|rock]] style than any others before. Songs like \"Iberia Sumergida\" and \"La Chispa Adecuada\" came into the first position of the lists. The title track, \"Avalancha\", came in the first positions of charts like MTV. The tour was the most extensive one of the band. The final concert of H\u00e9roes del Silencio was meant to take place in Los Angeles but it was canceled because the crowd was angry at the band after rumors of their split.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} H\u00e9roes said goodbye in Spain with the mythical phrase: \"''Nos vemos en la gira del proximo milenio. Hasta Siempre'' [See you on tour in the next millennium. Farewell].\".\n\n==Consecration and separation==\nAt the ''Avalancha'' tour, the band participated in the [[Monsters of Rock]] of Brasil in 1996 as headliners. The concert was not recorded. The H\u00e9roes also got a special in MTV, like Unplugged and Gustock.\n\nThe \"Tour macrogira Avalancha\" from July 1995 to October 1996 led them to give 152 concerts in Europe and America. The coexistence during that time was difficult, and fatigue lead to increased internal conflicts. During this development, Bunbury started his own compositions and recorded new songs, hinting that his future was already far from H\u00e9roes del Silencio. Their last concert, was in Los Angeles on 6 October 1996.\n\nBefore concluding the tour, and in a press conference in [[Lima]], Peru, H\u00e9roes del Silencio reported their temporary separation. Apart from its environment, the news was surprising, but eventually came to transcend some of the reasons that had led to such a situation. The musical differences, especially between Juan and Enrique, had led them to a distance, and these differences became personal. The deaths of two persons very close to the group as well influenced the band's spirit: their road manager Martin Druille in 1993, and Enrique's brother, Rafael, in 1994. As remarked by Bunbury, the last months of the tour were an ordeal for him.\n\n===2007 Reunion tour===\n[[File:Heroes del Silencio Sevilla Oct 07 2.jpg|thumb|right|H\u00e9roes playing in Sevilla on October 2007]]\n20 years after their first album, and 11 years after they split up, the band announced a ten-day reunion tour that would take them to [[Guatemala City]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Monterrey]], [[Ciudad de M\u00e9xico]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sevilla]], [[Zaragoza]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].
