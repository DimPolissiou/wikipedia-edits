R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and a protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12(they were probably drunk) ; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret. Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]]. They are waylaid by the magic of [[Old Man Willow]], but rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], who gives them shelter and guides them on their way. They are caught in fog on the Barrow Downs by [[Barrow-wight]]s and are entranced under a spell. Frodo breaks loose from the spell, attacks the barrow-wight and summons Bombadil, who again rescues the hobbits and sets them on their way.\n\nAt the ''Prancing Pony'' inn in the village of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], Frodo receives a delayed letter from Gandalf, and meets a man who calls himself Strider, a [[Ranger of the North]]; his real name is [[Aragorn]]. The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night. The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul. With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell. Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]]. Together they set out from Rivendell. Frodo is armed with [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], Bilbo's Elvish knife; he wears Bilbo's coat of Dwarf mail made of ''[[mithril]]''. The company, seeking a way through the Misty Mountains, tries the Pass of Caradhras, but abandons it in favour of the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|mines of Moria]]. In Moria Frodo is stabbed by an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-spear, but his coat of ''mithril'' armour saves his life. They are led through the mines by Gandalf, until he is killed battling a [[Balrog]]. Aragorn leads them out to [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. There [[Galadriel]] gives Frodo an Elven cloak and a phial carrying the Light of [[E\u00e4rendil]] to aid him on his dangerous quest.\n\nThe Fellowship travel by boat down the Anduin River and reach the hills of Parth Galen. There, Boromir, succumbing to the lure of the Ring, tries to take the ring by force from Frodo. Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.\n\n===''The Two Towers''===\nFrodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature [[Gollum]], who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring. Gollum attacks the hobbits, but Frodo subdues him with Sting. He takes pity on Gollum and spares his life, binding him to a promise to guide them through the dead marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum does. They find the gate impassable, but Gollum says that there is \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allows him to lead them south into [[Ithilien]]. There they meet [[Faramir]], younger brother of Boromir, who takes them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Frodo allows Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". Faramir provisions the hobbits and allows them to go on their way, but warns Frodo to beware of Gollum's treachery.\n\nThe three of them pass near Minas Morgul, where the pull of the Ring becomes almost unbearable. There they began the long climb up the Endless Stair, and at the top enter a tunnel, not knowing it is the home of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Gollum hopes to deliver the hobbits to her and retake the Ring after she kills them. Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel. After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\nSam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo. The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum. They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] as Mount Doom erupts.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire. They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents\u2014both Hobbits and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\u2014have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions [[The Scouring of the Shire|lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders]]. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.<ref group=T>''The Return of the King'', Book VI, VII, and VIII, pp. 315\u2013317 and 360\u2013363</ref> Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to [[Valinor]], the [[Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] where Frodo might find peace.\n\n===\"The Sea-Bell\"===\n\n\"[[The Sea-Bell]]\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' with the sub-title ''Frodos Dream''. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nFrodo did not appear until the third draft of ''A Long-Expected Party'' (the first chapter of ''The Lord of the Rings''), when he was named Bingo, son of Bilbo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', Vol. VI in ''The History of Middle-earth'', p. 28\u201329.</ref> In the fourth draft, he was renamed Bingo Bolger-Baggins, son of Rollo Bolger and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Tolkien did not change the name to Frodo until the third phase of writing, when much of the narrative, as far as the hobbits' arrival in Rivendell, had already taken shape.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 309.</ref> Prior to this, the name \"Frodo\" had been used for the character who eventually became Pippin Took.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 267.</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' the principal character is called Bingo Baggins; the name Frodo is given to another hobbit.

''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and a protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret. Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.\n\nThe hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the [[Old Forest]]. They are waylaid by the magic of [[Old Man Willow]], but rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], who gives them shelter and guides them on their way. They are caught in fog on the Barrow Downs by [[Barrow-wight]]s and are entranced under a spell. Frodo breaks loose from the spell, attacks the barrow-wight and summons Bombadil, who again rescues the hobbits and sets them on their way.\n\nAt the ''Prancing Pony'' inn in the village of [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], Frodo receives a delayed letter from Gandalf, and meets a man who calls himself Strider, a [[Ranger of the North]]; his real name is [[Aragorn]]. The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night. The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.\n\nWhile encamped on a hill, they are attacked by five Nazg\u00fbl. The chief of the Nazg\u00fbl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul. With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, [[Glorfindel]], Frodo is able to evade the Nazg\u00fbl and reach Rivendell. Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.\n\nThe [[Council of Elrond]] meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the [[Ring-bearer]]. A [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of nine companions]] is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elf]] [[Legolas]], and [[Boromir]], a man of [[Gondor]]. Together they set out from Rivendell. Frodo is armed with [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], Bilbo's Elvish knife; he wears Bilbo's coat of Dwarf mail made of ''[[mithril]]''. The company, seeking a way through the Misty Mountains, tries the Pass of Caradhras, but abandons it in favour of the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|mines of Moria]]. In Moria Frodo is stabbed by an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]]-spear, but his coat of ''mithril'' armour saves his life. They are led through the mines by Gandalf, until he is killed battling a [[Balrog]]. Aragorn leads them out to [[Lothl\u00f3rien]]. There [[Galadriel]] gives Frodo an Elven cloak and a phial carrying the Light of [[E\u00e4rendil]] to aid him on his dangerous quest.\n\nThe Fellowship travel by boat down the Anduin River and reach the hills of Parth Galen. There, Boromir, succumbing to the lure of the Ring, tries to take the ring by force from Frodo. Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.\n\n===''The Two Towers''===\nFrodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature [[Gollum]], who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring. Gollum attacks the hobbits, but Frodo subdues him with Sting. He takes pity on Gollum and spares his life, binding him to a promise to guide them through the dead marshes to the Black Gate, which Gollum does. They find the gate impassable, but Gollum says that there is \"another way\" into Mordor, and Frodo, over Sam's objections, allows him to lead them south into [[Ithilien]]. There they meet [[Faramir]], younger brother of Boromir, who takes them to Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Frodo allows Gollum to be captured by Faramir, saving Gollum's life but leaving him feeling betrayed by his \"master\". Faramir provisions the hobbits and allows them to go on their way, but warns Frodo to beware of Gollum's treachery.\n\nThe three of them pass near Minas Morgul, where the pull of the Ring becomes almost unbearable. There they began the long climb up the Endless Stair, and at the top enter a tunnel, not knowing it is the home of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Gollum hopes to deliver the hobbits to her and retake the Ring after she kills them. Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel. After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\nSam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo. The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum. They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] as Mount Doom erupts.\n\nAfter reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire. They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents\u2014both Hobbits and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\u2014have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions [[The Scouring of the Shire|lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders]]. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.<ref group=T>''The Return of the King'', Book VI, VII, and VIII, pp. 315\u2013317 and 360\u2013363</ref> Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to [[Valinor]], the [[Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] where Frodo might find peace.\n\n===\"The Sea-Bell\"===\n\n\"[[The Sea-Bell]]\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' with the sub-title ''Frodos Dream''. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic [[narrative poem]] represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\nFrodo did not appear until the third draft of ''A Long-Expected Party'' (the first chapter of ''The Lord of the Rings''), when he was named Bingo, son of Bilbo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', Vol. VI in ''The History of Middle-earth'', p. 28\u201329.</ref> In the fourth draft, he was renamed Bingo Bolger-Baggins, son of Rollo Bolger and Primula Brandybuck.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Tolkien did not change the name to Frodo until the third phase of writing, when much of the narrative, as far as the hobbits' arrival in Rivendell, had already taken shape.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 309.</ref> Prior to this, the name \"Frodo\" had been used for the character who eventually became Pippin Took.<ref group=T>''The Return of the Shadow'', p. 267.</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' the principal character is called Bingo Baggins; the name Frodo is given to another hobbit.

Kocher]] discusses the role of [[Divine providence|providence]], in the form of the intentions of the angel-like [[Valar]] or of the creator [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], in Bilbo's finding of the Ring and Frodo's bearing of it; as Gandalf says, Frodo was \"meant\" to have it, though it remains his choice to co-operate with this purpose.{{sfn|Kocher|1974|p=37}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[File:BakshiFrodo.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Frodo in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'']]\n[[File:Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins.png|right|thumb|[[Elijah Wood]] as Frodo Baggins in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\n\nIn [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|animated version]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Frodo was voiced by [[Christopher Guard]].\n\nIn the 1980 [[Rankin/Bass]] animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', made for television, the character was voiced by [[Orson Bean]], who had previously played Bilbo in the same company's adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''.\n\nIn the 1981 [[BBC]] radio [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|serial of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], Frodo is played by [[Ian Holm]], who later played Bilbo in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film adaptation]] of ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nIn the 1993 television [[miniseries]] ''[[Hobitit]]'' by Finnish broadcaster [[Yle]], Frodo is played by Taneli M\u00e4kel\u00e4.\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy (2001\u20132003) directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Frodo is played by American actor [[Elijah Wood]].

Selected 7th overall in the [[1998 NFL draft]], Turley played five seasons for the [[New Orleans Saints]] and a year with the [[St. Louis Rams]] before a serious back injury sidelined him for the 2004 and 2005 seasons.  He returned to football in 2006 as a member of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], where he spent the last two years of his career before announcing his retirement in December 2007.  Turley's high level of play earned him [[All-Pro]] honors for the 2000 season and a [[Pro Bowl]] invite following the 2001 season.  His career is best remembered by many for a 2001 incident in which he ripped off an opposing player's helmet and tossed it downfield, playing a key factor in his team losing the game but also earning the respect of many Saints fans for his defense of the quarterback.  Turley played college football at [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]].\n\nFollowing his retirement from football, Turley set out on a music career that included the release of several albums and the launch of his own record label.

Selected 7th overall in the [[1998 NFL draft]], Turley played five seasons for the [[New Orleans Saints]] and a year with the [[St. Louis Rams]] before a serious back injury sidelined him for the 2004 and 2005 seasons.  He returned to football in 2006 as a member of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], where he spent the last two years of his career before announcing his retirement in December 2007.  Turley's high level of play earned him [[All-Pro]] honors for the 2000 season and a [[Pro Bowl]] invite following the 2001 season.  His career is best remembered by many for a 2001 incident in which he ripped off an opposing player's helmet and tossed it downfield, playing a key factor in his team losing the game but also earning the respect of many Saints fans for his defense of the quarterback.  Turley played college football at [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]].\n\nFollowing his retirement from football, Turley set out on a music career that included the release of several albums and the launch of his own record label.  Playing his \"power country\" style of music, Turley opened for a number of well-known musical acts, including in 2010 when he went on tour with [[Hank Williams III]].  Turley has also been outspoken and involved in a number of player health issues post-retirement, particularly in regards to the neurological problems resulting from his football career ([[Early-onset Alzheimer's disease|early onset Alzheimer's]], [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE symptomatic]], [[seizures]], [[vertigo]]) and his use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as treatment.
