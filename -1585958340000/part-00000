The name \"Malbim\" was derived from the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] initials of his name. He used this acronym as his surname in all his published works, and became known by it in common usage.\n\n==Biography==\nMalbim was born in [[Volochysk]], [[Volhynia]] to Yehiel Michel Wisser. His father educated him in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the [[Talmud]]. After being orphaned as a child, Me\u00efr was cared for and educated by his stepfather, Rabbi Leib of Volochysk.\n\nAt the age of 13, he went to study in [[Warsaw]] where he became known as \"the [[iluy]] from Volhynia.\" He showed talent from his early childhood, and his works indicate that he had a considerable knowledge of secular sciences and history. From 1838 to 1845 he served as rabbi of [[Wrze\u015bnia|Wreschen]]. In the latter year he was called to the rabbinate of [[K\u0119pno|Kempen]], where he remained until 1859. He was thereafter also known as ''der Kempener Magid''.\n\nIn 1859, Malbim became [[chief rabbi]] of [[Bucharest]], Romania. He had disagreements with the upper class and educated Jews there, some of them Austrian citizens (called in Romanian ''sudi\u0163i''), led by the noted Dr. [[Iuliu Barasch]]. They wanted to introduce changes in the spirit of modern European life into the life of the local Jewry, as was done in some Reform congregations. Malbim defended the traditional style of [[Orthodox Judaism]], which demanded strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law and tradition]]. He rejected almost all suggestions to edit the [[Siddur]], give up beards or make other changes in exterior appearance, or to make other changes in observance.\n\nMalbim opposed construction of the big [[Templul Coral|Choral Temple]], to be equipped with a choir and organ, similar to the [[Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel|Great Synagogue of Leopoldstadt]] in [[Vienna]]. He thought this was too Christian in style. In 1864 the Choral Temple became the main neo-orthodox synagogue in Romania. He also condemned the founding (before he arrived) of the first two elementary schools in Bucharest for Jewish children to offer a general knowledge curriculum. In this period Romanian officials encouraged such efforts to integrate the Jews into mainstream Romanian life.\n\nMalbim's insistence on adhering to the halakha resulted in portions of the religious personnel ([[Shochet|shochtim]], [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]]im) to become hostile to him. By their frequent complaints, his opponents almost succeeded in having him sent to prison.  Malbim was freed through the intervention of Sir [[Moses Montefiore]], but it was upon the condition that he leave Romania.\n[[File:Malbim.jpg|thumb|The Malbim]]\n\nMalbim went to [[Constantinople]] and complained to the [[Turkey|Turkish government]], but obtained no satisfaction. After staying six months in Paris, he went to [[\u0141\u0119czyca|Lunshitz]], in Russian Poland, as successor to his deceased father-in-law, Hayyim Auerbach (1866). Shortly afterwards he became rabbi at [[Kherson]], and thence was called to the rabbinate of [[Mogilev]], on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] (1870). There, too, he was a staunch supporter of Judaism and was  resented by the richer Jews; they denounced him as a political criminal, and the governor of Moghilev forced him to leave the town.\n\nMalbim went to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] as chief rabbi of the Polish community, but he continued to have conflict with [[Reform Jews]]. Malbim visited [[Vilna]] in 1879, where the community would have appointed him rabbi, but the governor of [[Vilna]] opposed the election. He did not want to sanction the appointment of a rabbi who had been expelled from Moghilev as a political criminal. Malbim declined an offer to be chief rabbi of the Orthodox in New York City.<ref>[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayikra/geller.html The Malbim: Leadership and Challenge as Reflected in his Introduction to Vayikra and His Torah Commentary \"Hatorah Vehamitzvah\"], Study Sheet on the Weekly Torah Portion (No. 124. Parashat Vayikra 5756, 1996), from the Office of the Campus Rabbi of [[Bar-Ilan University]]</ref> In September 1879, Malbim was traveling to [[Kremenchuk]], where he had been called as rabbi, when he fell sick. He died on Rosh HaShanah, 1 Tishrei 5640 at [[Kiev]].\n\n== Methodology and style ==\n{{See also|Oral Torah #In rabbinic literature and commentary}}\nMalbim's fame and popularity rest upon his novel commentary to the Bible. His first published commentary was on [[Book of Esther|Megillat Esther]] (1845), followed by his commentary on most of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] from then until 1876.  His commentary on the Bible is based most notably upon his  principle that there are no true synonyms in the Tanakh; apparent stylistic repetitions are not that, but rather each introduces a distinct idea. His approach is described as follows:\n\n:\"Advancing a project initiated in [[Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg|Ya\u2018akov Mecklenberg\u2019s]] Pentateuch commentary, Malbim formulates 613 grammatical principles to justify rabbinic halakhic exegesis in ''[[Sifra]]'' and elsewhere. To demonstrate the sanctity of scripture, Malbim devised a unique [[hermeneutic]] that he ambitiously applied to the entire Bible, resulting in one of the monumental Jewish scholarly achievements of the era: a wide-ranging, comprehensive commentary .... that infuses traditional Hebrew linguistic, philosophical, and mystical learning with contemporary concepts from science, psychology, epistemology, logic, and metaphysics.\"<ref>[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Meir_Leib_ben_Yehiel_Mikhael Me\u2019ir Leib ben Ye\u1e25i\u2019el Mikha\u2019el] by Prof. Mordechai Cohen of [[Yeshiva University]]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* \"''Artzoth haChayim''\", commentary and novellae on the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (section Orah Hayim, Breslau, 1837);\n* \"''Artzoth haShalom''\", collection of sermons (Krotoschin, 1839);\n* \"''HaTorah vehaMitzva''\", analytical and innovative commentary on the Pentateuch and the [[midrash halakha]] (Warsaw, 1874&ndash;80), including the linguistic guide Ayelet ha-Shachar on differences between similar terms in Hebrew;\n* \"''Mikra'ei Kodesh''\", commentary on the Prophets and Hagiographa (ib. 1874; this commentary is in parallel, on the words and on the sense; Malbim always endeavored to explain the different meanings of synonyms);\n* \"''Mashal uMelitza''\", dramatic [[philippic]], in verse, against hypocrisy (Paris, 1867).\n* \"''Eretz Hemdah''\", Commentary on the Bible according to the Midrash.

After being orphaned as a child, Me\u00efr was cared for and educated by his stepfather, Rabbi Leib of Volochysk.\n\nAt the age of 13, he went to study in [[Warsaw]]. He was known there as \"the [[iluy]] from Volhynia.\" He showed talent from his early childhood, and his works indicate that he had a considerable knowledge of secular sciences and history. From 1838 to 1845 he served as rabbi of [[Wrze\u015bnia|Wreschen]]. In the latter year he was called to the rabbinate of [[K\u0119pno|Kempen]], where he remained until 1859. He was thereafter also known as ''der Kempener Magid''.\n\nIn 1859, Malbim became [[chief rabbi]] of [[Bucharest]], Romania. He had disagreements with the upper class and educated Jews there, some of them Austrian citizens (called in Romanian ''sudi\u0163i''), led by the noted Dr. [[Iuliu Barasch]]. They wanted to introduce changes in the spirit of modern European life into the life of the local Jewry, as was done in some Reform congregations. Malbim defended the traditional style of [[Orthodox Judaism]], which demanded strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law and tradition]]. He rejected almost all suggestions to edit the [[Siddur]], give up beards or make other changes in exterior appearance, or to make other changes in observance.\n\nMalbim opposed construction of the big [[Templul Coral|Choral Temple]], to be equipped with a choir and organ, similar to the [[Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel|Great Synagogue of Leopoldstadt]] in [[Vienna]]. He thought this was too Christian in style. In 1864 the Choral Temple became the main neo-orthodox synagogue in Romania. He also condemned the founding (before he arrived) of the first two elementary schools in Bucharest for Jewish children to offer a general knowledge curriculum. In this period Romanian officials encouraged such efforts to integrate the Jews into mainstream Romanian life.\n\nMalbim's insistence on adhering to the halakha resulted in portions of the religious personnel ([[Shochet|shochtim]], [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]]im) to become hostile to him. By their frequent complaints, his opponents almost succeeded in having him sent to prison.  Malbim was freed through the intervention of Sir [[Moses Montefiore]], but it was upon the condition that he leave Romania.\n[[File:Malbim.jpg|thumb|The Malbim]]\n\nMalbim went to [[Constantinople]] and complained to the [[Turkey|Turkish government]], but obtained no satisfaction. After staying six months in Paris, he went to [[\u0141\u0119czyca|Lunshitz]], in Russian Poland, as successor to his deceased father-in-law, Hayyim Auerbach (1866). Shortly afterwards he became rabbi at [[Kherson]], and thence was called to the rabbinate of [[Mogilev]], on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] (1870). There, too, he was a staunch supporter of Judaism and was  resented by the richer Jews; they denounced him as a political criminal, and the governor of Moghilev forced him to leave the town.\n\nMalbim went to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] as chief rabbi of the Polish community, but he continued to have conflict with [[Reform Jews]]. Malbim visited [[Vilna]] in 1879, where the community would have appointed him rabbi, but the governor of [[Vilna]] opposed the election. He did not want to sanction the appointment of a rabbi who had been expelled from Moghilev as a political criminal. Malbim declined an offer to be chief rabbi of the Orthodox in New York City.<ref>[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayikra/geller.html The Malbim: Leadership and Challenge as Reflected in his Introduction to Vayikra and His Torah Commentary \"Hatorah Vehamitzvah\"], Study Sheet on the Weekly Torah Portion (No. 124. Parashat Vayikra 5756, 1996), from the Office of the Campus Rabbi of [[Bar-Ilan University]]</ref> In September 1879, Malbim was traveling to [[Kremenchuk]], where he had been called as rabbi, when he fell sick. He died on Rosh HaShanah, 1 Tishrei 5640 at [[Kiev]].\n\n== Methodology and style ==\n{{See also|Oral Torah #In rabbinic literature and commentary}}\nMalbim's fame and popularity rest upon his novel commentary to the Bible. His first published commentary was on [[Book of Esther|Megillat Esther]] (1845), followed by his commentary on most of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] from then until 1876.  His commentary on the Bible is based most notably upon his  principle that there are no true synonyms in the Tanakh; apparent stylistic repetitions are not that, but rather each introduces a distinct idea. His approach is described as follows:\n\n:\"Advancing a project initiated in [[Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg|Ya\u2018akov Mecklenberg\u2019s]] Pentateuch commentary, Malbim formulates 613 grammatical principles to justify rabbinic halakhic exegesis in ''[[Sifra]]'' and elsewhere. To demonstrate the sanctity of scripture, Malbim devised a unique [[hermeneutic]] that he ambitiously applied to the entire Bible, resulting in one of the monumental Jewish scholarly achievements of the era: a wide-ranging, comprehensive commentary .... that infuses traditional Hebrew linguistic, philosophical, and mystical learning with contemporary concepts from science, psychology, epistemology, logic, and metaphysics.\"<ref>[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Meir_Leib_ben_Yehiel_Mikhael Me\u2019ir Leib ben Ye\u1e25i\u2019el Mikha\u2019el] by Prof. Mordechai Cohen of [[Yeshiva University]]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* \"''Artzoth haChayim''\", commentary and novellae on the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (section Orah Hayim, Breslau, 1837);\n* \"''Artzoth haShalom''\", collection of sermons (Krotoschin, 1839);\n* \"''HaTorah vehaMitzva''\", analytical and innovative commentary on the Pentateuch and the [[midrash halakha]] (Warsaw, 1874&ndash;80), including the linguistic guide Ayelet ha-Shachar on differences between similar terms in Hebrew;\n* \"''Mikra'ei Kodesh''\", commentary on the Prophets and Hagiographa (ib. 1874; this commentary is in parallel, on the words and on the sense; Malbim always endeavored to explain the different meanings of synonyms);\n* \"''Mashal uMelitza''\", dramatic [[philippic]], in verse, against hypocrisy (Paris, 1867).\n* \"''Eretz Hemdah''\", Commentary on the Bible according to the Midrash.

Although its location remains uncertain, the majority of academic conjectures place it on the south bank of the Yangtze River, southwest of present-day [[Wuhan]] and northeast of Baqiu (present-day [[Yueyang]], [[Hunan]]).\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of the Han dynasty}}\n\nBy the early third century, the Han dynasty, which had ruled China for almost four centuries (albeit with a 16-year [[Wang Mang|interruption]], dividing the dynasty into its Western and Eastern periods), was crumbling. [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] had been a political figurehead since 189, with no control over the actions of the various warlords controlling their respective territories. One of the most powerful warlords in China was Cao Cao, who, by 207, had [[Cao Cao's unification of northern China|unified northern China]] and retained total control of the [[North China Plain]]. He then completed [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain|a successful campaign]] against the [[Wuhuan]] in the winter of the same year, thus securing his northern frontier. Upon his return in 208, he was appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]], a position that granted him absolute authority over the entire imperial government {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1969|pp=253, 465 ''6n''}}. Shortly afterwards, in the autumn of 208, his army began a southern campaign ({{Harvcolnb|Eikenberry|1994}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|2003}}).\n\nThe Yangtze River in the area of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] (covering present-day [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]] provinces) was key to the success of this strategy. If Cao Cao was to have any hope of reuniting the sundered Han empire, he had to achieve naval control of the middle Yangtze and command the strategic naval base at [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]] as a means of access to the southern region {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2003}}. Two warlords controlled the regions of the Yangtze that were key to Cao Cao's success: [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of Jing Province, controlled the area west of the mouth of the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]] (roughly encompassing the area around the city of [[Hankou District|Xiakou]] and all territory south of that region), and Sun Quan, who controlled the river east of the Han and the southeastern territories abutting it {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=773}}. A third ally, Liu Bei, was living in refuge with Liu Biao at the garrison in [[Fancheng District|Fancheng]] (in present-day [[Xiangyang]]), having fled from the northeast to Jing Province following a failed plot to assassinate Cao Cao and restore power to the imperial dynasty ({{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|2007|p=480}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|1969|p=258}}).\n\nThe initial stages of the campaign were an unqualified success for Cao Cao, as the command of Jing Province had been substantially weakened and the Jing armies exhausted by conflict with Sun Quan to the south {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=486}}. Factions had arisen supporting either of Liu Biao's two sons in a struggle for succession. The younger son prevailed, and Liu Biao's dispossessed eldest son, [[Liu Qi (Liu Biao's son)|Liu Qi]], departed to assume a [[Commandery (China)|commandery]], Jiangxia (present-day eastern Hubei) {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=241}}. Liu Biao died of illness only a few weeks later, while Cao Cao was advancing from the north and, under these circumstances, Liu Biao's younger son and successor, [[Liu Cong (Han dynasty)|Liu Cong]], quickly surrendered. Cao Cao thus captured a sizeable fleet and secured the naval base at Jiangling. This provided him with a key strategic military depot and forward base to harbour his ships {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=246, 250, 255}}.\n\nWhen Jing Province fell, Liu Bei quickly fled south, accompanied by a refugee population of civilians and soldiers. This disorganised exodus was pursued by Cao Cao's elite cavalry, and was surrounded and decisively beaten at the [[Battle of Changban]] (near present-day [[Dangyang]], Hubei). Liu Bei escaped, however, and fled further east to Xiakou, where he liaised with Sun Quan's emissary [[Lu Su]]. At this point historical accounts are inconsistent; Lu Su may have successfully encouraged Liu Bei to move even further east, to Fankou (\u6a0a\u53e3; around present-day [[Ezhou]], Hubei).<ref name=\"fankou\">[[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' repeatedly asserts that Liu Bei was at Xiakou. Other historical accounts support this version as well. [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms|Annotations]] to the text of the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'' made nearly two centuries later by [[Pei Songzhi]] support the Fankou version, thus Xiakou appears in the main text and Fankou in the annotations. This discrepancy is later reflected in contradictory passages in the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' by [[Sima Guang]] (and its English translation, {{Harvcoltxt|de Crespigny|1990|p=248}}), which has Liu Bei \"quartered at Fankou\" at the same time as Zhou Yu is requesting to send troops to Xiakou, and Liu Bei \"waits anxiously\" in Xiakou for the reinforcements. For a detailed discussion, see {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006|pp=231\u201334}}.</ref> In either case, Liu Bei was later joined by Liu Qi and levies from Jiangxia {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=255}}. Liu Bei's main advisor, [[Zhuge Liang]], was sent to Chaisang (\u67f4\u6851; in present-day [[Jiujiang]], [[Jiangxi]]) to negotiate forming a mutual front against Cao Cao with Sun Quan {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1969|p=263}}.\n\nBy the time Zhuge Liang arrived, Cao Cao had already sent Sun Quan a letter boasting of commanding 800,000 men and hinting that he wanted Sun to surrender.<ref>(\u6c5f\u8868\u50b3\u8f09\u66f9\u516c\u8207\u6b0a\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8fd1\u8005\u5949\u8fad\u4f10\u7f6a\uff0c\u65c4\u9ebe\u5357\u6307\uff0c\u5289\u742e\u675f\u624b\u3002\u4eca\u6cbb\u6c34\u8ecd\u516b\u5341\u842c\u8846\uff0c\u65b9\u8207\u5c07\u8ecd\u6703\u7375\u65bc\u5433\u3002\u300d\u6b0a\u5f97\u66f8\u4ee5\u793a\u7fa3\u81e3\uff0c\u83ab\u4e0d\u56ae\u9707\u5931\u8272\u3002) ''Jiang Biao Zhuan'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 47.</ref> The faction led by Sun Quan's Chief Clerk, [[Zhang Zhao]], advocated surrender, citing Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical advantage. However, on separate occasions, Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Quan's chief commander, Zhou Yu, all presented arguments to persuade Sun Quan to agree to the alliance against the northerners. Sun Quan finally decided upon war, chopping off a corner of his desk during an assembly and stating: \"Anyone who still dares argue for surrender will be [treated] the same as this desk.\"<ref>(\u6c5f\u8868\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u6b0a\u62d4\u5200\u65ab\u524d\u594f\u6848\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8af8\u5c07\u540f\u6562\u5fa9\u6709\u8a00\u7576\u8fce\u64cd\u8005\uff0c\u8207\u6b64\u6848\u540c\uff01\u300d) ''Jiang Biao Zhuan'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 54.</ref> He then assigned Zhou Yu, [[Cheng Pu]], and Lu Su with 30,000 men to aid Liu Bei against Cao Cao {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1996}}.\n\nAlthough Cao Cao had boasted command of 800,000 men, Zhou Yu estimated Cao Cao's actual troop strength to be closer to 230,000. Furthermore, this total included 80,000 [[impressment|impressed]] troops from the armies of the recently deceased Liu Biao, so the loyalty and morale of a large number of Cao Cao's force was uncertain {{Harvcol|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}. With the 20,000 soldiers that Liu Bei had gathered, the alliance consisted of approximately 50,000 marines who were trained and prepared for battle {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=252, 255}}.\n\n==Battle==\n{{See also|Red Cliffs order of battle}}\n[[File:Battle of Red Cliffs 208 extended map-en.svg|thumb|400px|Battle of Red Cliffs, and Cao Cao's retreat (also shown: [[Battle of Changban]]).

Plagued by disease and low morale due to the series of forced marches they had undertaken on the prolonged southern campaign {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2003}}, Cao Cao's men could not gain an advantage in the small skirmish which ensued, so Cao Cao retreated to Wulin (north of the Yangtze River) and the allies pulled back to the south {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=257}}.\n\nCao Cao had chained his ships from stem to stern, possibly aiming to reduce seasickness in his navy, which was composed mostly of northerners who were not used to living on ships. Observing this, divisional commander [[Huang Gai]] sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron<ref>The number of vessels in the squadron is unclear. As de Crespigny observes, \"Firstly, the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'' states that the number of vessels in Huang Gai's squadron was 'several tens,' but the parallel passage in ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''...&nbsp;allocates Huang Gai only ten ships\" {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=265}}.</ref> of [[capital ship]]s described as ''mengchong doujian'' (\u8499\u885d\u9b25\u8266).<ref name=\"mengchong\">The exact nature of these vessels is unclear. {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006|p=218}} refers to them as \"leather-covered assault warships,\" but the reference is parenthetical, as this issue is peripheral to the topic of Zhang's paper. In a lengthier discussion, {{Harvcoltxt|de Crespigny|1990|pp=266\u201368}} separates the two terms, describing ''[[mengchong]]'' as \"...&nbsp;covered with some form of protective material&nbsp;... used to break the enemy line of battle and perhaps to damage their ships and men with a ram or by projectiles\" and ''doujian'' as \"...&nbsp;fighting platforms for spearmen and archers to engage in close combat&nbsp;...\" {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=268}}. He concludes that ''mengchong doujian'' is a \"general description for vessels of war\" {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=265}}.</ref> The ships had been converted into [[fire ship]]s by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil. As Huang Gai's \"defecting\" squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze. A large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280|pp=54, 1262\u201363}}.\n\nFollowing the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault. The northern army was thrown into confusion and was utterly defeated. Seeing the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before withdrawing {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280}}.\n\nCao Cao's army attempted a retreat along <!-- NOTE: do not wikilink Huarong; modern Huarong is far south of ancient Huarong -->Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of [[Dongting Lake]]. Heavy rains had made the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road to allow the horsemen to cross. Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort. The allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery (\u5357\u90e1; present-day western Hubei); combined with famine and disease, this decimated Cao Cao's remaining forces. Cao Cao then retreated north to his home base of [[Ye (ancient China)|Ye]] (in present-day [[Handan]], [[Hebei]]), leaving [[Cao Ren]] and [[Xu Huang]] to guard Jiangling, [[Yue Jin]] stationed in [[Xiangzhou District, Xiangyang|Xiangyang]], and [[Man Chong]] in Dangyang {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280}}.\n\nThe allied counterattack might have vanquished Cao Cao and his forces entirely. However, the crossing of the Yangtze River dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries. To restore order, a detachment led by Sun Quan's general [[Gan Ning]] established a bridgehead in [[Yichang|Yiling]] to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented further catastrophe ({{Harvcolnb|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|2007|p=239}}).\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Mengchong.png|thumb|One type of ship used in the battle \u2013 the ''[[mengchong]]'' (\u8499\u885d): leather-covered assault warship designed to break enemy lines.]]\n\nA combination of Cao Cao's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhou Yu had previously observed that Cao Cao's generals and soldiers were mostly cavalry and infantry, and few had any experience in naval warfare. Cao Cao also had little support among the people of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]], and thus lacked a secure forward base of operations {{Harvcol|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}. Despite the strategic acumen Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, in this case he had simply assumed that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy. Cao's first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy: with only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao's troops were ravaged by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water<!-- many sailors couldn't swim, it's not important unless your ship sinks: and many of his crew could not even swim to save themselves-->. Tropical diseases, to which the southerners were largely immune, were also rampant in Cao Cao's camps. Although numerous, Cao Cao's men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: \"Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth\" ([[#Reference-Military Documents-1979|Military Documents 1979:193]]).\n\nA key advisor, [[Jia Xu]], had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overtaxed armies be given time to rest and replenish before engaging the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded the advice {{Harvcol|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}. Cao Cao's own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies utilised by his enemy during the battle: \"...&nbsp;it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated. It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself.\" {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280|p=54:1265}}.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n[[File:Western Han soldiers 2.jpg|thumb|Han-era painted ceramic statues of a Chinese cavalryman and ten infantrymen with armor, shields, and missing weapons]]\nBy the end of 209, the post Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu. The borders of the land under Cao Cao's control contracted about {{convert|160|km|mi}}, to the area around [[Xiangzhou District, Xiangyang|Xiangyang]] {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=291}}. Liu Bei gained territory by taking over the four commanderies (Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang) south of the Yangtze River. Sun Quan's troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei's in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan's strength in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=291\u201392, 197}}. Liu Bei also occupied Jing Province that Cao Cao had recently lost\u2014a strategic and naturally fortified area on the Yangtze River that Sun Quan claimed for himself. The control of Jing Province provided Liu Bei with virtually unlimited access to the passage into [[Yi Province]] (covering present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) and important waterways into [[Wu (region)|Wu]] (southeastern China) and dominion of the southern Yangtze River. Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he had at Jiangling, nor would a similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals present itself again {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}}. The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing Province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of southern China from the northern heartland of the [[Yellow River]] valley and foreshadowed a north-south axis of hostility that would continue for centuries {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=260}}.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Battle of Red Cliffs 208 map-en.svg|thumb|400px|&nbsp;Three possible locations of the Battle of Red Cliffs. A fourth possibility is an undefined locale in Jiayu County, downriver (northeast) of the Chibi City location.]]\nThe precise location of the Red Cliffs battlefield has long been the subject of both popular and academic debates, but has never been conclusively established.<ref>This discussion is largely drawn from {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006}}.</ref> Scholarly debates have continued for at least 1,350 years {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=215}}, and a number of arguments in favour of alternative sites have been put forward. There are clear grounds for rejecting at least some of these proposals, but four alternative locations are still advocated. According to {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006}}, many of the current debates stem from the fact that the course and length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=225}}. The modern-day debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries. For example, although modern Huarong city is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the 3rd century the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze ({{Harvcolnb|Zhang|2006|p=229}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|1990|p=256 ''78n''}}). Moreover, one candidate site, Puqi (\u84b2\u573b), was renamed \"[[Chibi City]]\" (\u8d64\u58c1\u5e02) in 1998 in a direct attempt to tie this location to the historical battlefield.<ref>See [http://www.chibi.com.cn/col2080/col6057/ http://www.chibi.com.cn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705095517/http://www.chibi.com.cn/col2080/col6057/ |date=2007-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nHistorical records state that Cao Cao's forces retreated north across the Yangtze after the initial engagement at Red Cliffs, unequivocally placing the battle site on the south bank of the Yangtze. For this reason, a number of sites on the north bank have been discounted by historians and geographers. Historical accounts also establish east and west boundaries for a stretch of the Yangtze which encompasses all possible sites for the battlefield. The allied forces travelled upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou. Since the Yangtze flows roughly eastward towards the ocean (with northeast and southeast [[meander]]s), Red Cliffs must at least be west of Fankou, which is farther downstream. The westernmost boundary is also clear, since Cao Cao's eastern advance from Jiangling included passing Baqiu (present-day [[Yueyang]], [[Hunan]]) on the shore of [[Dongting Lake]]. The battle must also have been downstream (northeast) of that location ({{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|1990|pp=256\u201357}}; {{Harvcolnb|Zhang|2006|p=217}}).\n\n[[File:\u4e1c\u5761\u8d64\u58c1\u5efa\u7b51\u7fa4.JPG|thumb|250px|Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs]]\nOne popular candidate for the battle site is Chibi Hill in [[Huangzhou]], sometimes referred to as \"[[Su Dongpo]]'s Red Cliffs\" or the \"Literary Red Cliffs\" (\u6587\u8d64\u58c1). Support for this conjecture arises largely due to the famous 11th-century poem \"[[First Ode on the Red Cliffs|First Rhapsody on the Red Cliffs]]\", which equates the Huangzhou Hill with the battlefield location. Excluding [[Tone (linguistics)|tone marks]], the [[pinyin]] romanization of this cliff's name is \"Chibi\", the same as the pinyin for Red Cliffs. However, the Chinese characters are completely different (\u8d64\u9f3b) as is their meaning (\"Red Nose Hill\"). This site is also on the north bank of the Yangtze, and is directly across from Fankou rather than upstream from it {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|pp=215}}. Moreover, if the allied Sun-Liu forces left from Xiakou rather than Fankou, as the oldest historical sources suggest,<ref name=\"fankou\"/> then the hill in Huangzhou would have been ''downstream'' from the point of departure, a possibility which cannot be reconciled with historical sources.\n\nPuqi, now named Chibi City, is perhaps the most widely accepted candidate. To differentiate from Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs, the site is also referred to as the \"Military Red Cliffs\" (\u6b66\u8d64\u58c1). It is directly across the Yangtze from Wulin. This argument was first proposed in the early Tang dynasty {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=217}}. There are also characters engraved in the cliffs (see image at the top of this page) suggesting that this is the site of the battle. The origin of the engraving can be dated to between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, making it at least 1,000 years old {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|pp=219, 228}}.\n\nSome sources mention the south banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County (\u5609\u9c7c\u53bf) in the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Xianning]] in [[Hubei]] province as a possible location. This would place the battlefield downstream from Puqi (Chibi City), a view that is supported by scholars of [[History of China|Chinese history]] such as [[Rafe de Crespigny]], [[Wang Li (scholar)|Wang Li]] and [[Zhu Dongrun]], following the [[Qing dynasty]] historical document ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=256}}.\n\nAnother candidate is [[Wuhan]], which straddles the Yangtze at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers. It is east of both Wulin (and Chibi City across the river) and Jiayu. This metropolis was incorporated by joining three cities. There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers, southwest of the former [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] city, which is now part of Wuhan {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=256 ''n 78''}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006|pp=215, 223}} asserts that the Chibi battlefield was one of a set of hills in Wuchang that were levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material.<ref>C.P. Fitzgerald described the location in 1926: \"But there was the&nbsp;... two rivers, the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han]] and the&nbsp;... Yangtze, across them, respectively, [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and Wuchang&nbsp;... The confluence of the Han&nbsp;... and the Yangtze&nbsp;... made Wuhan&nbsp;... a key strategic centre. Hanyang is backed by a long, low hill, called Tortoise Mountain, which faces the hill on the eastern slope of which Wuchang is built. The two hills narrow the Yangtze at this point by perhaps as much as a third of its width above and below them. The passage is dominated by a high bluff, called Chi Bi, \"The Red Cliff,\" the scene of a famous naval battle in the fourth [sic] century. It is at this point that the great bridge, carrying railway and road, has been constructed in the fledgling years of the [[People's Republic of China]] {{Harvcol|Fitzgerald|1985|pp=90, 92\u201393}}.</ref> Citing several historical-geographical studies, {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006}} shows that earlier accounts place the battlefield in Wuchang. Sheng Hongzhi's 5th-century ''Jingzhou ji'' in particular places the Chibi battlefield a distance of 160&nbsp;[[Li (unit)|li]] (approximately {{convert|80|km|mi}}) downstream from Wulin, but since the Paizhou and Luxikou meanders increased the length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuchang by 100&nbsp;[[Li (unit)|li]] (approximately {{convert|50|km|mi}}; ''see map'') some time in the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=225}}, later works do not regard Wuchang as a possible site.\n\n==Fictionalised account==\n[[File:Battle of Red Cliffs Peking Opera 4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Cao Cao]] surrounded by his generals. From a [[Peking opera]] performance by [[Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company]] on January 17, 2015, in [[Tianchan Theatre]], [[Shanghai]], China.]]\nThe romantic tradition that originated with the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' differs from historical accounts in many details. For example, Cao Cao's army strength was exaggerated to over 830,000 men. This may be attributed to the ethos of later times, particularly of the Southern [[Song dynasty]] {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=483}}. The state of Shu Han, in particular, was viewed by later literati as the \"legitimate\" successor to the Han dynasty, so fictionalised accounts assign greater prominence than the historical records warrant to the roles of [[Liu Bei]], [[Zhuge Liang]] and other heroes from Shu. This is generally accomplished by minimising the importance of Eastern Wu commanders and advisors such as Zhou Yu and Lu Su {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=xi}}. While historical accounts describe Lu Su as a sensible advisor and Zhou Yu as an eminent military leader and \"generous, sensible and courageous\" man, ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' depicts Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as cruel and cynical {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=300, 305\u201306 ''29n''}}. Both are depicted as being inferior to Zhuge Liang in every respect {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=264}}.\n\nThe romances added wholly fictional and fantastical elements to the historical accounts and these were repeated in popular plays and operas. Examples from the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' include Zhuge Liang [[List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Zhuge Liang prays for the eastern wind|pretending to use magic to call forth favourable winds]] (that he had in fact predicted by astronomical observation) for the fire ship attack, his strategy of \"[[List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Borrowing arrows with straw boats|using straw boats to borrow arrows]]\", and [[List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Guan Yu releases Cao Cao at Huarong Trail|Guan Yu capturing and releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Trail]]. The fictionalised accounts also name Zhuge Liang as a military commander in the combined forces, which is historically inaccurate {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=260\u201364}}.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nPresent-day [[Chibi City]] in [[Hubei]] province was formerly named Puqi. In 1998, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Chinese State Council]] approved the renaming of the city in celebration of the battle at Red Cliffs. Cultural festivals held by the city have dramatically increased tourism. ([[#Reference-Xinhua-1997|Xinhua 1997]]).

Liu Bei and Sun Quan frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the [[Yangtze River]] and reunite the territory of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]].\n\nThe allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of [[Shu Han]] and [[Eastern Wu]].{{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=273}} The battle has been called [[Largest naval battle in history|the largest naval battle in history]] in terms of numbers involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militaryhistory.norwich.edu/largest-naval-sea-battles-in-military-history/|title=The Largest Naval Sea Battles in Military History|work=norwich.edu|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> Descriptions of the battle differ widely and the site of the battle is fiercely debated {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=256 ''78n''}}. Although its location remains uncertain, the majority of academic conjectures place it on the south bank of the Yangtze River, southwest of present-day [[Wuhan]] and northeast of Baqiu (present-day [[Yueyang]], [[Hunan]]).\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of the Han dynasty}}\n\nBy the early third century, the Han dynasty, which had ruled China for almost four centuries (albeit with a 16-year [[Wang Mang|interruption]], dividing the dynasty into its Western and Eastern periods), was crumbling. [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] had been a political figurehead since 189, with no control over the actions of the various warlords controlling their respective territories. One of the most powerful warlords in China was Cao Cao, who, by 207, had [[Cao Cao's unification of northern China|unified northern China]] and retained total control of the [[North China Plain]]. He then completed [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain|a successful campaign]] against the [[Wuhuan]] in the winter of the same year, thus securing his northern frontier. Upon his return in 208, he was appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]], a position that granted him absolute authority over the entire imperial government {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1969|pp=253, 465 ''6n''}}. Shortly afterwards, in the autumn of 208, his army began a southern campaign ({{Harvcolnb|Eikenberry|1994}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|2003}}).\n\nThe Yangtze River in the area of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] (covering present-day [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]] provinces) was key to the success of this strategy. If Cao Cao was to have any hope of reuniting the sundered Han empire, he had to achieve naval control of the middle Yangtze and command the strategic naval base at [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]] as a means of access to the southern region {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2003}}. Two warlords controlled the regions of the Yangtze that were key to Cao Cao's success: [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of Jing Province, controlled the area west of the mouth of the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]] (roughly encompassing the area around the city of [[Hankou District|Xiakou]] and all territory south of that region), and Sun Quan, who controlled the river east of the Han and the southeastern territories abutting it {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=773}}. A third ally, Liu Bei, was living in refuge with Liu Biao at the garrison in [[Fancheng District|Fancheng]] (in present-day [[Xiangyang]]), having fled from the northeast to Jing Province following a failed plot to assassinate Cao Cao and restore power to the imperial dynasty ({{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|2007|p=480}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|1969|p=258}}).\n\nThe initial stages of the campaign were an unqualified success for Cao Cao, as the command of Jing Province had been substantially weakened and the Jing armies exhausted by conflict with Sun Quan to the south {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=486}}. Factions had arisen supporting either of Liu Biao's two sons in a struggle for succession. The younger son prevailed, and Liu Biao's dispossessed eldest son, [[Liu Qi (Liu Biao's son)|Liu Qi]], departed to assume a [[Commandery (China)|commandery]], Jiangxia (present-day eastern Hubei) {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=241}}. Liu Biao died of illness only a few weeks later, while Cao Cao was advancing from the north and, under these circumstances, Liu Biao's younger son and successor, [[Liu Cong (Han dynasty)|Liu Cong]], quickly surrendered. Cao Cao thus captured a sizeable fleet and secured the naval base at Jiangling. This provided him with a key strategic military depot and forward base to harbour his ships {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=246, 250, 255}}.\n\nWhen Jing Province fell, Liu Bei quickly fled south, accompanied by a refugee population of civilians and soldiers. This disorganised exodus was pursued by Cao Cao's elite cavalry, and was surrounded and decisively beaten at the [[Battle of Changban]] (near present-day [[Dangyang]], Hubei). Liu Bei escaped, however, and fled further east to Xiakou, where he liaised with Sun Quan's emissary [[Lu Su]]. At this point historical accounts are inconsistent; Lu Su may have successfully encouraged Liu Bei to move even further east, to Fankou (\u6a0a\u53e3; around present-day [[Ezhou]], Hubei).<ref name=\"fankou\">[[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' repeatedly asserts that Liu Bei was at Xiakou. Other historical accounts support this version as well. [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms|Annotations]] to the text of the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'' made nearly two centuries later by [[Pei Songzhi]] support the Fankou version, thus Xiakou appears in the main text and Fankou in the annotations. This discrepancy is later reflected in contradictory passages in the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' by [[Sima Guang]] (and its English translation, {{Harvcoltxt|de Crespigny|1990|p=248}}), which has Liu Bei \"quartered at Fankou\" at the same time as Zhou Yu is requesting to send troops to Xiakou, and Liu Bei \"waits anxiously\" in Xiakou for the reinforcements. For a detailed discussion, see {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006|pp=231\u201334}}.</ref> In either case, Liu Bei was later joined by Liu Qi and levies from Jiangxia {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=255}}. Liu Bei's main advisor, [[Zhuge Liang]], was sent to Chaisang (\u67f4\u6851; in present-day [[Jiujiang]], [[Jiangxi]]) to negotiate forming a mutual front against Cao Cao with Sun Quan {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1969|p=263}}.\n\nBy the time Zhuge Liang arrived, Cao Cao had already sent Sun Quan a letter boasting of commanding 800,000 men and hinting that he wanted Sun to surrender.<ref>(\u6c5f\u8868\u50b3\u8f09\u66f9\u516c\u8207\u6b0a\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8fd1\u8005\u5949\u8fad\u4f10\u7f6a\uff0c\u65c4\u9ebe\u5357\u6307\uff0c\u5289\u742e\u675f\u624b\u3002\u4eca\u6cbb\u6c34\u8ecd\u516b\u5341\u842c\u8846\uff0c\u65b9\u8207\u5c07\u8ecd\u6703\u7375\u65bc\u5433\u3002\u300d\u6b0a\u5f97\u66f8\u4ee5\u793a\u7fa3\u81e3\uff0c\u83ab\u4e0d\u56ae\u9707\u5931\u8272\u3002) ''Jiang Biao Zhuan'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 47.</ref> The faction led by Sun Quan's Chief Clerk, [[Zhang Zhao]], advocated surrender, citing Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical advantage. However, on separate occasions, Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Quan's chief commander, Zhou Yu, all presented arguments to persuade Sun Quan to agree to the alliance against the northerners. Sun Quan finally decided upon war, chopping off a corner of his desk during an assembly and stating: \"Anyone who still dares argue for surrender will be [treated] the same as this desk.\"<ref>(\u6c5f\u8868\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u6b0a\u62d4\u5200\u65ab\u524d\u594f\u6848\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8af8\u5c07\u540f\u6562\u5fa9\u6709\u8a00\u7576\u8fce\u64cd\u8005\uff0c\u8207\u6b64\u6848\u540c\uff01\u300d) ''Jiang Biao Zhuan'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 54.</ref> He then assigned Zhou Yu, [[Cheng Pu]], and Lu Su with 30,000 men to aid Liu Bei against Cao Cao {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1996}}.\n\nAlthough Cao Cao had boasted command of 800,000 men, Zhou Yu estimated Cao Cao's actual troop strength to be closer to 230,000. Furthermore, this total included 80,000 [[impressment|impressed]] troops from the armies of the recently deceased Liu Biao, so the loyalty and morale of a large number of Cao Cao's force was uncertain {{Harvcol|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}. With the 20,000 soldiers that Liu Bei had gathered, the alliance consisted of approximately 50,000 marines who were trained and prepared for battle {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=252, 255}}.\n\n==Battle==\n{{See also|Red Cliffs order of battle}}\n[[File:Battle of Red Cliffs 208 extended map-en.svg|thumb|400px|Battle of Red Cliffs, and Cao Cao's retreat (also shown: [[Battle of Changban]]).

Plagued by disease and low morale due to the series of forced marches they had undertaken on the prolonged southern campaign {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2003}}, Cao Cao's men could not gain an advantage in the small skirmish which ensued, so Cao Cao retreated to Wulin (north of the Yangtze River) and the allies pulled back to the south {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=257}}.\n\nCao Cao had chained his ships from stem to stern, possibly aiming to reduce seasickness in his navy, which was composed mostly of northerners who were not used to living on ships. Observing this, divisional commander [[Huang Gai]] sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron<ref>The number of vessels in the squadron is unclear. As de Crespigny observes, \"Firstly, the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'' states that the number of vessels in Huang Gai's squadron was 'several tens,' but the parallel passage in ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''...&nbsp;allocates Huang Gai only ten ships\" {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=265}}.</ref> of [[capital ship]]s described as ''mengchong doujian'' (\u8499\u885d\u9b25\u8266).<ref name=\"mengchong\">The exact nature of these vessels is unclear. {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006|p=218}} refers to them as \"leather-covered assault warships,\" but the reference is parenthetical, as this issue is peripheral to the topic of Zhang's paper. In a lengthier discussion, {{Harvcoltxt|de Crespigny|1990|pp=266\u201368}} separates the two terms, describing ''[[mengchong]]'' as \"...&nbsp;covered with some form of protective material&nbsp;... used to break the enemy line of battle and perhaps to damage their ships and men with a ram or by projectiles\" and ''doujian'' as \"...&nbsp;fighting platforms for spearmen and archers to engage in close combat&nbsp;...\" {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=268}}. He concludes that ''mengchong doujian'' is a \"general description for vessels of war\" {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=265}}.</ref> The ships had been converted into [[fire ship]]s by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil. As Huang Gai's \"defecting\" squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze. A large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280|pp=54, 1262\u201363}}.\n\nFollowing the initial shock, Zhou Yu and the allies led a lightly armed force to capitalise on the assault. The northern army was thrown into confusion and was utterly defeated. Seeing the situation was hopeless, Cao Cao then issued a general order of retreat and destroyed a number of his remaining ships before withdrawing {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280}}.\n\nCao Cao's army attempted a retreat along <!-- NOTE: do not wikilink Huarong; modern Huarong is far south of ancient Huarong -->Huarong Road, including a long stretch passing through marshlands north of [[Dongting Lake]]. Heavy rains had made the road so treacherous that many of the sick soldiers had to carry bundles of grass on their backs and use them to fill the road to allow the horsemen to cross. Many of these soldiers drowned in the mud or were trampled to death in the effort. The allies, led by Zhou Yu and Liu Bei, gave chase over land and water until they reached Nan Commandery (\u5357\u90e1; present-day western Hubei); combined with famine and disease, this decimated Cao Cao's remaining forces. Cao Cao then retreated north to his home base of [[Ye (ancient China)|Ye]] (in present-day [[Handan]], [[Hebei]]), leaving [[Cao Ren]] and [[Xu Huang]] to guard Jiangling, [[Yue Jin]] stationed in [[Xiangzhou District, Xiangyang|Xiangyang]], and [[Man Chong]] in Dangyang {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280}}.\n\nThe allied counterattack might have vanquished Cao Cao and his forces entirely. However, the crossing of the Yangtze River dissolved into chaos as the allied armies converged on the riverbank and fought over the limited number of ferries. To restore order, a detachment led by Sun Quan's general [[Gan Ning]] established a bridgehead in [[Yichang|Yiling]] to the north, and only a staunch rearguard action by Cao Ren prevented further catastrophe ({{Harvcolnb|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|2007|p=239}}).\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Mengchong.png|thumb|One type of ship used in the battle \u2013 the ''[[mengchong]]'' (\u8499\u885d): leather-covered assault warship designed to break enemy lines.]]\n\nA combination of Cao Cao's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhou Yu had previously observed that Cao Cao's generals and soldiers were mostly cavalry and infantry, and few had any experience in naval warfare. Cao Cao also had little support among the people of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]], and thus lacked a secure forward base of operations {{Harvcol|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}. Despite the strategic acumen Cao Cao had displayed in earlier campaigns and battles, in this case he had simply assumed that numerical superiority would eventually defeat the Sun and Liu navy. Cao's first tactical mistake was converting his massive army of infantry and cavalry into a marine corps and navy: with only a few days of drills before the battle, Cao Cao's troops were ravaged by sea-sickness and lack of experience on water<!-- many sailors couldn't swim, it's not important unless your ship sinks: and many of his crew could not even swim to save themselves-->. Tropical diseases, to which the southerners were largely immune, were also rampant in Cao Cao's camps. Although numerous, Cao Cao's men were already exhausted by the unfamiliar environment and the extended southern campaign, as Zhuge Liang observed: \"Even a powerful arrow at the end of its flight cannot penetrate a silk cloth\" ([[#Reference-Military Documents-1979|Military Documents 1979:193]]).\n\nA key advisor, [[Jia Xu]], had recommended after the surrender of Liu Cong that the overtaxed armies be given time to rest and replenish before engaging the armies of Sun Quan and Liu Bei, but Cao Cao disregarded the advice {{Harvcol|Eikenberry|1994|p=60}}. Cao Cao's own thoughts regarding his failure at Red Cliffs suggest that he held his own actions and misfortunes responsible for the defeat, rather than the strategies utilised by his enemy during the battle: \"...&nbsp;it was only because of the sickness that I burnt my ships and retreated. It is out of all reason for Zhou Yu to take the credit for himself.\" {{Harvcol|Chen|c. 280|p=54:1265}}.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n[[File:Western Han soldiers 2.jpg|thumb|Han-era painted ceramic statues of a Chinese cavalryman and ten infantrymen with armor, shields, and missing weapons]]\nBy the end of 209, the post Cao Cao had established at Jiangling fell to Zhou Yu. The borders of the land under Cao Cao's control contracted about {{convert|160|km|mi}}, to the area around [[Xiangzhou District, Xiangyang|Xiangyang]] {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=291}}. Liu Bei gained territory by taking over the four commanderies (Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang) south of the Yangtze River. Sun Quan's troops had suffered far greater casualties than Liu Bei's in the extended conflict against Cao Ren following the Battle of Red Cliffs and the death of Zhou Yu in 210 resulted in a drastic weakening of Sun Quan's strength in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=291\u201392, 197}}. Liu Bei also occupied Jing Province that Cao Cao had recently lost\u2014a strategic and naturally fortified area on the Yangtze River that Sun Quan claimed for himself. The control of Jing Province provided Liu Bei with virtually unlimited access to the passage into [[Yi Province]] (covering present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) and important waterways into [[Wu (region)|Wu]] (southeastern China) and dominion of the southern Yangtze River. Never again would Cao Cao command so large a fleet as he had at Jiangling, nor would a similar opportunity to destroy his southern rivals present itself again {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}}. The Battle of Red Cliffs and the capture of Jing Province by Liu Bei confirmed the separation of southern China from the northern heartland of the [[Yellow River]] valley and foreshadowed a north-south axis of hostility that would continue for centuries {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=260}}.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Battle of Red Cliffs 208 map-en.svg|thumb|400px|&nbsp;Three possible locations of the Battle of Red Cliffs. A fourth possibility is an undefined locale in Jiayu County, downriver (northeast) of the Chibi City location.]]\nThe precise location of the Red Cliffs battlefield has long been the subject of both popular and academic debates, but has never been conclusively established.<ref>This discussion is largely drawn from {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006}}.</ref> Scholarly debates have continued for at least 1,350 years {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=215}}, and a number of arguments in favour of alternative sites have been put forward. There are clear grounds for rejecting at least some of these proposals, but four alternative locations are still advocated. According to {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006}}, many of the current debates stem from the fact that the course and length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuhan has changed since the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=225}}. The modern-day debate is also complicated by the fact that the names of some of the key locations have changed over the following centuries. For example, although modern Huarong city is located in Hunan, south of the Yangtze, in the 3rd century the city of that name was due east of Jiangling, considerably north of the Yangtze ({{Harvcolnb|Zhang|2006|p=229}}; {{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|1990|p=256 ''78n''}}). Moreover, one candidate site, Puqi (\u84b2\u573b), was renamed \"[[Chibi City]]\" (\u8d64\u58c1\u5e02) in 1998 in a direct attempt to tie this location to the historical battlefield.<ref>See [http://www.chibi.com.cn/col2080/col6057/ http://www.chibi.com.cn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705095517/http://www.chibi.com.cn/col2080/col6057/ |date=2007-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nHistorical records state that Cao Cao's forces retreated north across the Yangtze after the initial engagement at Red Cliffs, unequivocally placing the battle site on the south bank of the Yangtze. For this reason, a number of sites on the north bank have been discounted by historians and geographers. Historical accounts also establish east and west boundaries for a stretch of the Yangtze which encompasses all possible sites for the battlefield. The allied forces travelled upstream from either Fankou or Xiakou. Since the Yangtze flows roughly eastward towards the ocean (with northeast and southeast [[meander]]s), Red Cliffs must at least be west of Fankou, which is farther downstream. The westernmost boundary is also clear, since Cao Cao's eastern advance from Jiangling included passing Baqiu (present-day [[Yueyang]], [[Hunan]]) on the shore of [[Dongting Lake]]. The battle must also have been downstream (northeast) of that location ({{Harvcolnb|de Crespigny|1990|pp=256\u201357}}; {{Harvcolnb|Zhang|2006|p=217}}).\n\n[[File:\u4e1c\u5761\u8d64\u58c1\u5efa\u7b51\u7fa4.JPG|thumb|250px|Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs]]\nOne popular candidate for the battle site is Chibi Hill in [[Huangzhou]], sometimes referred to as \"[[Su Dongpo]]'s Red Cliffs\" or the \"Literary Red Cliffs\" (\u6587\u8d64\u58c1). Support for this conjecture arises largely due to the famous 11th-century poem \"[[First Ode on the Red Cliffs|First Rhapsody on the Red Cliffs]]\", which equates the Huangzhou Hill with the battlefield location. Excluding [[Tone (linguistics)|tone marks]], the [[pinyin]] romanization of this cliff's name is \"Chibi\", the same as the pinyin for Red Cliffs. However, the Chinese characters are completely different (\u8d64\u9f3b) as is their meaning (\"Red Nose Hill\"). This site is also on the north bank of the Yangtze, and is directly across from Fankou rather than upstream from it {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|pp=215}}. Moreover, if the allied Sun-Liu forces left from Xiakou rather than Fankou, as the oldest historical sources suggest,<ref name=\"fankou\"/> then the hill in Huangzhou would have been ''downstream'' from the point of departure, a possibility which cannot be reconciled with historical sources.\n\nPuqi, now named Chibi City, is perhaps the most widely accepted candidate. To differentiate from Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs, the site is also referred to as the \"Military Red Cliffs\" (\u6b66\u8d64\u58c1). It is directly across the Yangtze from Wulin. This argument was first proposed in the early Tang dynasty {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=217}}. There are also characters engraved in the cliffs (see image at the top of this page) suggesting that this is the site of the battle. The origin of the engraving can be dated to between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, making it at least 1,000 years old {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|pp=219, 228}}.\n\nSome sources mention the south banks of the Yangtze in Jiayu County (\u5609\u9c7c\u53bf) in the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Xianning]] in [[Hubei]] province as a possible location. This would place the battlefield downstream from Puqi (Chibi City), a view that is supported by scholars of [[History of China|Chinese history]] such as [[Rafe de Crespigny]], [[Wang Li (scholar)|Wang Li]] and [[Zhu Dongrun]], following the [[Qing dynasty]] historical document ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=256}}.\n\nAnother candidate is [[Wuhan]], which straddles the Yangtze at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers. It is east of both Wulin (and Chibi City across the river) and Jiayu. This metropolis was incorporated by joining three cities. There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers, southwest of the former [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] city, which is now part of Wuhan {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=256 ''n 78''}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006|pp=215, 223}} asserts that the Chibi battlefield was one of a set of hills in Wuchang that were levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material.<ref>C.P. Fitzgerald described the location in 1926: \"But there was the&nbsp;... two rivers, the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han]] and the&nbsp;... Yangtze, across them, respectively, [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and Wuchang&nbsp;... The confluence of the Han&nbsp;... and the Yangtze&nbsp;... made Wuhan&nbsp;... a key strategic centre. Hanyang is backed by a long, low hill, called Tortoise Mountain, which faces the hill on the eastern slope of which Wuchang is built. The two hills narrow the Yangtze at this point by perhaps as much as a third of its width above and below them. The passage is dominated by a high bluff, called Chi Bi, \"The Red Cliff,\" the scene of a famous naval battle in the fourth [sic] century. It is at this point that the great bridge, carrying railway and road, has been constructed in the fledgling years of the [[People's Republic of China]] {{Harvcol|Fitzgerald|1985|pp=90, 92\u201393}}.</ref> Citing several historical-geographical studies, {{Harvcoltxt|Zhang|2006}} shows that earlier accounts place the battlefield in Wuchang. Sheng Hongzhi's 5th-century ''Jingzhou ji'' in particular places the Chibi battlefield a distance of 160&nbsp;[[Li (unit)|li]] (approximately {{convert|80|km|mi}}) downstream from Wulin, but since the Paizhou and Luxikou meanders increased the length of the Yangtze River between Wuli and Wuchang by 100&nbsp;[[Li (unit)|li]] (approximately {{convert|50|km|mi}}; ''see map'') some time in the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties {{Harvcol|Zhang|2006|p=225}}, later works do not regard Wuchang as a possible site.\n\n==Fictionalised account==\n[[File:Battle of Red Cliffs Peking Opera 4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Cao Cao]] surrounded by his generals. From a [[Peking opera]] performance by [[Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company]] on January 17, 2015, in [[Tianchan Theatre]], [[Shanghai]], China.]]\nThe romantic tradition that originated with the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' differs from historical accounts in many details. For example, Cao Cao's army strength was exaggerated to over 830,000 men. This may be attributed to the ethos of later times, particularly of the Southern [[Song dynasty]] {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|2007|p=483}}. The state of Shu Han, in particular, was viewed by later literati as the \"legitimate\" successor to the Han dynasty, so fictionalised accounts assign greater prominence than the historical records warrant to the roles of [[Liu Bei]], [[Zhuge Liang]] and other heroes from Shu. This is generally accomplished by minimising the importance of Eastern Wu commanders and advisors such as Zhou Yu and Lu Su {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=xi}}. While historical accounts describe Lu Su as a sensible advisor and Zhou Yu as an eminent military leader and \"generous, sensible and courageous\" man, ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' depicts Lu Su as unremarkable and Zhou Yu as cruel and cynical {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=300, 305\u201306 ''29n''}}. Both are depicted as being inferior to Zhuge Liang in every respect {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|p=264}}.\n\nThe romances added wholly fictional and fantastical elements to the historical accounts and these were repeated in popular plays and operas. Examples from the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' include Zhuge Liang [[List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Zhuge Liang prays for the eastern wind|pretending to use magic to call forth favourable winds]] (that he had in fact predicted by astronomical observation) for the fire ship attack, his strategy of \"[[List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Borrowing arrows with straw boats|using straw boats to borrow arrows]]\", and [[List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Guan Yu releases Cao Cao at Huarong Trail|Guan Yu capturing and releasing Cao Cao at Huarong Trail]]. The fictionalised accounts also name Zhuge Liang as a military commander in the combined forces, which is historically inaccurate {{Harvcol|de Crespigny|1990|pp=260\u201364}}.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nPresent-day [[Chibi City]] in [[Hubei]] province was formerly named Puqi. In 1998, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Chinese State Council]] approved the renaming of the city in celebration of the battle at Red Cliffs. Cultural festivals held by the city have dramatically increased tourism. ([[#Reference-Xinhua-1997|Xinhua 1997]]). In 1983, a statue of prominent [[Song dynasty]] poet, [[Su Shi]], was erected at the Huangzhou site of 'Su Dongpo's Red Cliffs' in tribute to his writings regarding Red Cliff ([[#Reference-Xinhua-1983|Xinhua 1983]]).\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Su Shi-Former Ode on the Red Cliff.jpg|''[[Former Ode on the Red Cliffs]]'', A famous poem by [[Su Shi]] written during the [[Song dynasty]] \u2013 [[National Palace Museum]]\n</gallery>\n\nVideo games based on the Three Kingdoms era (such as [[Koei]]'s ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' series, ''[[Sangokushi Koumeiden]]'', ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'', ''[[Kessen II]]'' and ''[[Total War: Three Kingdoms]]'') have scenarios that include the battle. Other games utilise the Battle of Red Cliffs as their central focus. These include titles popular in Asia, such as the original Japanese version of ''[[Warriors of Fate]]'' and ''[[Dragon Throne: Battle of Red Cliffs]]''.\n\nA 2008 film titled ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'',<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.monkeypeaches.com/battleofredcliff.html| title= The Battle of Red Cliff (Chi Bi) \u2013 MonkeyPeaches| accessdate= 2007-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071201050550/http://www.monkeypeaches.com/battleofredcliff.html| archivedate= 1 December 2007| url-status= dead}}</ref> directed by [[John Woo]], showcased the Red Cliff legacy and was a massive box-office success in China.\n\n''Battle at the Red Cliffs'' is one of the 10 volumes in an illustrated rendition of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by a Singapore publishing company, [[Asiapac Books]], in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacbooks.com/product.asp?pid%3D768 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620032522/http://www.asiapacbooks.com/product.asp?pid=768 |archivedate=2008-06-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Battle of Red Cliffs}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{wikicite|id=Xinhua-1983|reference=\"11th century writer's statue erected in Hubei province\".
