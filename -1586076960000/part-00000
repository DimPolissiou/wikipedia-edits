{"title_page": "Offline editing", "text_new": "{{short description|Post production film process}}\n{{unreferenced|date=May 2008}}\n'''Offline editing''' is part of the [[post-production]] [[process]] of [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] in which raw [[footage]] is copied and the copy only is then edited, thereby not affecting the camera original [[film stock]] or [[video tape]].  Once the project has been completely offline [[video editing|edited]], the original media will be assembled in the online editing stage.\n\nThe term [[offline]] originated in the computing and telecommunications industries, meaning \"''not under the direct control of another device''\" ([[automation]]).\n\nModern offline [[video editing]] is conducted in a [[non-linear editing]] (NLE) suite.  The digital revolution has made the offline editing [[workflow]] process immeasurably quicker, as practitioners moved from time-consuming ([[video tape]] to tape) [[linear video editing]] online editing suites, to computer hardware and [[video editing software]] such as [[Adobe Premiere]], [[Final Cut Pro]], [[Avid Technology|Avid]], [[Sony Vegas]], [[Lightworks]] and [[VideoPad]].  Typically, all the original footage (often tens or hundreds of hours) is [[Digitization|digitized]] into the suite at a low resolution. The editor and director are then free to work with all the options to create the final cut. Therefore the offline editing stage is the creative storytelling stage that defines the structure, mood, pacing and story of the final show. Many versions and revisions are done at this stage until the edit gets to a stage know as [[picture lock]]. This is when it then moves onto the following stages of [[Post-production|post production]] know as [[Online editing (video production)|online editing]], [[Color grading|colour grading]] and audio mixing.\n\n== History ==\n\n===From film to tape===\n[[Film editing]] used an offline approach almost from the beginning. Film editors worked with a [[workprint]] of the original film negative to protect the negative from handling damage. When two-inch [[quadraplex]] [[video tape]] recording was first introduced by [[Ampex]] in 1956, it could not be physically cut and spliced as simply and cleanly as film negatives could be. One error-prone method option was to cut the tape with a razor blade. Since there was no visible frame line on the {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} tape, a special [[ferrofluid]] developing solution was applied to the tape, allowing the editor to view the recorded control track pulse under a [[microscope]], and thus determine where one frame ended and the next began. This process was not always exact, and if imperfectly performed would lead to picture breakup when the cut was played. Generally this process was used to assemble scenes together, not for creative editing.\n\nThe second option for video editing was to use two tape machines, one playing back the original tapes, and the other recording that playback. The original tapes were '''pre rolled''', manually cued to a few seconds prior to the start of a shot on the player, while the recorder was set to record. Each machine was rolled forward simultaneously, and a punch in recording, similar to [[punch in / out]] of early audio [[multitrack recording]]s was made at the appropriate moment. Beyond not being very precise, recorders of this era cost much more than a house, making this process an expensive use of the machines. This technique of re-recording from [[Communication source|source]] to [[edit master]] came to be known as [[linear video editing]].\n\nThis was the way things were for television shows shot on tape for the first 15 years. Even such fast-paced shows as ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' continued to use the razor blade technique.\n\n===New technological developments===\n\nThree developments of the late sixties and early seventies revolutionized video editing, and made it possible for television to have its own version of the film workprint/conform process.\n\n====Time code====\nThe first was the invention of [[time code]]. Whereas film negative had numbers printed optically along the side of the film, so that every frame could be identified exactly, video tape had no such system. Only video, audio, and a control pulse were recorded. Early attempts to rectify this were primitive to say the least. An announcer reciting the seconds was recorded onto an audio channel on the tape. Time code introduced frame precision, by recording a machine readable signal on an audio channel. A time code reader device translated this signal into hours, minutes, seconds and frames, originally displayed on a [[Nixie tube]] display, and later with [[LED]] readouts.  This innovation made it possible for the editor to note the exact frames at which to make a cut, and thus be much more precise. He could create a paper edit by writing down the numbers of the first and last frames of each shot, and then arrange them in order on paper prior to the actual edit session with the expensive VTRs.\n\n====Cheaper video recorders====\n\nAlthough video technology had the potential to be cheaper since it doesn't have the costs of film stock and have to go through the development process respectively, the quality of early video recording technology in the 1950s and even into the mid 1960s was often far too low to be taken seriously against the aesthetical look, familiarity and relative ease of editing of [[16mm]] and [[35mm movie film|35mm]] film stock \u2013 which many television cinematographers used well up until the late 1980s in documentaries, dramas etc. before video technology caught up to being 'acceptable' as television cameras and camcorders eventually displaced film stock for regular television use as they became lighter and more practical to take with them. Because early video cameras were so large and so expensive, it wasn't until 1984 with the JVC VHS-C camcorder that consumers had access to video tape technology.\n\nProfessionally, early video cameras were designated mostly for studio use, as up until the mid-1980s, when the camera unit and recorder unit merged as a camcorder (CAMera-reCORDER) as their bulky size made them far too big and bulky to be used outside against the smaller and more practical film camera.\n\nFor example, British sitcom Only Fools and Horses used videotape for internal scenes, but used film stock for external scenes for lighting reasons \u2013 it was difficult with tube sensors to get a stable, quality image without them needing a lot of lighting.\n\nThe second development was cheaper [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]]. Though not suitable for broadcast use directly, these provided a way to make a copy of the master, with its time code visibly inserted into a small box or 'time code window' in the picture. This tape could then be played in an office or at home on a video recorder costing only as much as a used car. The editor would note down the numbers of the shots and decide the order. They might simply write them in a list, or they might dub from one of these small machines to another to create a [[rough cut]] edit, and note the necessary frame numbers by watching this tape.\n\n====Exact editing====\nThough both of these developments helped greatly, effectively creating the offline editing method, they didn't solve the problem of precisely controlling the video recorder for frame accurate editing. That required precise control of the tape transport mechanism, using a dedicated edit controller that could read the time code and perform an edit exactly on cue.\n\nThat innovation came about as a result of research conducted by [[CMX Systems|CMX]], a joint venture of the [[CBS]] and [[Memorex]] corporations. The intent was to create a much less haphazard method of editing video directly that had all of the creative control of traditional film editing. The result, the [[CMX 600]], accomplished this goal with a two part process. Camera master tapes were dubbed as [[black and white]] [[analog video]] to very large computer memory discs. The editor could access any shot exactly, and quickly edit a precise black and white, low quality version of the program. More importantly, re-editing was trivial, as no cuts were actually performed. The shots were simply accessed and played in sequence from the disc in real time. The computer kept track of all the numbers in this offline stage of the process, and when the editor was satisfied, output them as an [[Edit decision list]] (EDL). This EDL was used in the final stage of the process, the online edit. To make it work, special computer to [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) edit interfaces had to be developed, called [[I-Squared]]s. Under the control of a computer reading back the EDL and [[communications protocol]]s, these I-Squareds took control and shuttled the broadcast quality VTRs exactly to the points necessary to record and edit master with exact edits from the source tapes.\n\nThough recording to computer disc pack and this first attempt at [[non-linear editing]] on video was abandoned as too expensive, the rest of the hardware was recycled into the offline/online edit process that remained dominant in television production for the next 20 years or more.\n\nAlthough tape formats changed from open reels to [[videocassette]]s (VCR), and all the equipment rapidly became much cheaper, the basics of the process remained the same. An editor would offline on a less expensive, low quality format, before entering the online editing suite with an EDL and master source tapes, to finish the broadcast quality version of the [[television show]].\nEven after the transition to digital the concept is the same, with low resolution proxy files streaming from central media storage during editing and the full quality video only getting brought up from deep storage once the clip is committed and rendered.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Direct to disk recording]]\n*[[DTE (Direct To Edit)]]\n*[[Non-destructive editing]]\n*[[Tapeless camcorder]]\n*[[Video server]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Film Editing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Offline Editing}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:History of television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Post production film process}}\n{{unreferenced|date=May 2008}}\n'''Offline editing''' is part of the [[post-production]] [[process]] of [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] in which raw [[footage]] is copied and the copy only is then edited, thereby not affecting the camera original [[film stock]] or [[video tape]].
