And it is fair to say that the Government and the Municipality have already bravely tackled the problem and that a town-plan ambitious enough to turn Nairobi into a thing of beauty has been slowly worked out, and much has already been done.

It also angered the [[Kikuyu people]], who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of [[World War II]], this friction developed into the [[Mau Mau]] rebellion. [[Jomo Kenyatta]], Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n===Post Independence===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and [[Water scarcity|water shortages]] were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zicht op Nairobi met op de voorgrond het stadspark met tribune TMnr 20014416.jpg|thumb|Nairobi in 1973]]\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.<ref>[http://kicc.co.ke/about/ourhistory \"Our History\"], The Kenyatta International Convention Centre.</ref>\n\nThree years prior in 1972, the [[World Bank]] approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29&nbsp;million (US$111.8&nbsp;million in 2013 dollars).<ref name=\"nairobiairport\">{{cite web | title=Nairobi Airport Project | url=http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P001235/nairobi-airport-project?lang=en | publisher=The World Bank | accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> On 14 March 1978, construction of the current terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] less than five months before his death.

This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.<ref>[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kibaki-to-officially-open-Sh30bn-Thika-superhighway/1056-1612572-eg30pcz/index.html \"Kibaki to officially open Sh30bn Thika superhighway\"], ''The Nation'', 5 November 2012.</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2017, The current president [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa.

Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is currently 4.1% a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=26125 |title=Build cities to contain population explosion |last=Oronje |first=Rose |date=July 27, 2005 |work=The Standard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174509/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=26125 |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nThese data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a current (2011) growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5&nbsp;million in 2025.\n\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oyugi|first=Maurice Onyango|last2=K\u2019Akumu|first2=Owiti A.|title=Land use management challenges for the city of Nairobi|journal=Urban Forum|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=94\u2013113|doi=10.1007/BF02681232|issn=1015-3802|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[Kenya National Theatre]], and the [[Kenya National Archives]].

Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]] and [[Meja Mwangi]] who were part of post-colonial writing.\n\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\n\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is ''[[Out of Africa]]''. The book was written by [[Karen Blixen]], whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in [[Kenya]]. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], is named after her.\n\nIn 1985, ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' was made into a film, directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. The film won 28 awards, including seven [[Academy Awards]]. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's [[Karen Blixen Museum (Kenya)|Karen Blixen Museum]].\n\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]], Kenya's foremost writer.\n\nNairobi has been the set of several other [[Cinema of the United States|American]] and [[British Film Industry|British]] films. The most recent of these was ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the [[Kibera]] slum.\n\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is [[Lupita Nyong'o]]. Lupita received an Oscar award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|best supporting actress]] in her role as Patsy in the film ''[[12 Years a Slave]]'' during the ''[[86th Academy Awards]]'' at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\n\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinemas]] in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series ''[[Sense8]]'' which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in [[The Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB).\n\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film ''[[Eye in the Sky (2015 film)|Eye in the Sky]]'', which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series [[Money Heist]].\n\n===Food===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to ''[[nyama choma]]'' which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as [[KFC]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Hardee's]] and [[Burger King]] which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, [[Galittos]], [[Steers]], [[PizzaMojo]], [[Spur Steak Ranches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing?lite |title=Fast food finds fans in sub-Sahara Africa, where obesity problem is growing \u2013 World News |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, [[Nairobi Java House]] and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\n\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eatout.co.ke/nairobi-restaurant-week |title=Nairobi Restaurant Week 2016 |last=Kenya |first=EatOut |website=eatout.co.ke |access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref> NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n===Music===\n\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. [[Benga music|Benga]] is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of [[jazz]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]] music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\n\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the [[African Great Lakes]]. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of [[soukous]] music. This genre was originally developed in [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. After the political climate in the region [[Congo Crisis|deteriorated]], many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as [[Super Mazembe|Orchestra Super Mazembe]] moved from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] to Nairobi and found great success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orchestra Super Mazembe |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |accessdate=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231064112/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |archivedate=31 December 2007}}</ref> [[Virgin records]] became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several [[soukous]] artists.\n\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the [[Kenyan hip hop]] scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenyan. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Successful artists based in Nairobi include [[Jua Cali]], [[Nonini]], Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and [[David Mathenge|Nameless]]. Popular Record labels include [[Ogopa DJs]], Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, [[Calif Records]] and Bornblack Music Group.\n\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi.

Acts that have performed in Nairobi include Lost Boyz, [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]], [[Akon]], Eve, T.O.K, [[Sean Paul]], [[Wayne Wonder]], [[Alaine]], Konshens, [[Ja Rule]], and [[Morgan Heritage]], and Cabo Snoop. Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.\n\nNairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in Kenya producing DJs as well as producers like Suraj, Jack Rooster, Euggy, [[DJ Fita]], Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including [[Diplo]], [[Major Lazer]] [[Kyau & Albert]], Solarity, [[Ronski Speed]], and [[Boom Jinx]].\n\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations{{POV statement|date=December 2012}}.

It was established in 1956, as part of the [[University of East Africa]], but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|title=University of Nairobi Factfile \u2013 UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI|publisher=|access-date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035948/http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Kenyatta University]] is situated {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on {{convert|1100|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. Currently it is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\n[[Strathmore University]] started in 1961 as an [[Advanced Level (UK)]] Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\n* [[United States International University|United States International University \u2013 Nairobi]] was originally a branch of the [[United States International University]], but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\n* In 2005, The [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi]] was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\n[[File:Catholic University of Eastern Africa - garden.jpg|thumb|[[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]]]]\n* The [[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]] located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\n* [[Technical University of Kenya|The Technical University of Kenya]] (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only [[Institute of technology|Technical University]] in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by [[Mwai Kibaki]] in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies. \n* [[KCA University]] (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\n* The Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\n[[File:Umma University.png|thumb|left|400px|[[Umma University]]]]\n* [[Pan African Christian University]] is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\n* [[East Africa Institute of Certified Studies]] (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\n* [[Compugoal College]]\n* [[Riara University]] on Mbagathi road.\n* [[Umma University]] is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.\n\nNumerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n[[File:Syokimau Railway Station.jpg|thumb|300px|Syokimau Railway Station]]\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of [[Thika Road]] has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor|LAPPSET]] project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\n\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to [[Kisumu]].\n\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\n\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\n\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the [[President of Kenya]] Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened ''Madaraka Express'' currently operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n====Airports====\n[[File:Nairobi Arrivals Terminal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]]]\n[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the [[FAA]] boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001232614/aviation-sector-in-new-high-as-passenger-numbers-hit-record-10-million|title=Aviation sector in new high as passenger numbers hit record 10 million|first=Frankline|last=Sunday|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Wilson Airport]] is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000210004/wilson-airport-builds-sh163m-tower-amidst-land-grabbing-claims|title=Wilson Airport builds Sh163m tower amidst land grabbing claims|first=Peter|last=Muiruri|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Eastleigh Airport]] is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-[[jet aircraft|jet]] airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from [[Southampton]] to [[Cape Town]] in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by [[flying boat]]s between Britain and [[Kisumu]] and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n====Matatu====\n[[File:A matatu.jpg|thumb|A matatu]]\n{{main|Matatu}}\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\n[[Matatu]], which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport.<ref>{{cite web|last=United Nations Offices Nairobi Interns |title=How to get around Nairobi |publisher=interns.unon.org |url=http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075002/http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2007 |accessdate=5 July 2007 }}</ref> They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite [[association football|football]] team or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist. More recently, some have even painted [[Barack Obama]]'s face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\n\nHowever, in 2004, a [[Seat belt legislation|law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts]] and [[speed governor]]s and to be painted with a yellow stripe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crackdown hits Kenyan commuters|publisher=BBC|date=2 February 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|accessdate=3 July 2006 }}</ref> At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n====Buses====\n[[File:Nairobi Public Transport.jpg|thumb|Public transport in Nairobi]]\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\n\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n====Trains====\nNairobi was founded as a [[railway town]], and the main headquarters of [[Kenya Railways|Kenya Railways (KR)]] is still situated at [[Nairobi railway station]], which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from [[Mombasa]] to [[Kampala]]. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and [[Kisumu]]. A number of morning and evening commuter [[Nairobi rail service|trains]] connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\n\nThe new [[Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway]] connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The [[Nairobi Terminus]] is located at [[Syokimau]], some 20&nbsp;km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Museam hill interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Museum hill interchange, where Uhuru highway links to forest road which is an extension of the Thika superhighway. Nairobi's tall skyscrapers can be seen on the background.]]\n[[File:The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD]]\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. [[Ongata Rongai]], Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by [[Thika Road]], Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\n\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), [[Eldoret]], [[Kisumu]], [[Nakuru]], [[Naivasha]], and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\n\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n[[File:Eastern Bypass, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|Eastern Bypass, Nairobi]]\n\n====Private car population projection for Nairobi====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It also angered the [[Kikuyu people]], who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of [[World War II]], this friction developed into the [[Mau Mau]] rebellion. [[Jomo Kenyatta]], Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n===Post Independence===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and [[Water scarcity|water shortages]] were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zicht op Nairobi met op de voorgrond het stadspark met tribune TMnr 20014416.jpg|thumb|Nairobi in 1973]]\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.<ref>[http://kicc.co.ke/about/ourhistory \"Our History\"], The Kenyatta International Convention Centre.</ref>\n\nThree years prior in 1972, the [[World Bank]] approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29&nbsp;million (US$111.8&nbsp;million in 2013 dollars).<ref name=\"nairobiairport\">{{cite web | title=Nairobi Airport Project | url=http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P001235/nairobi-airport-project?lang=en | publisher=The World Bank | accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> On 14 March 1978, construction of the current terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport's single runway and opened by President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] less than five months before his death.

This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.<ref>[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kibaki-to-officially-open-Sh30bn-Thika-superhighway/1056-1612572-eg30pcz/index.html \"Kibaki to officially open Sh30bn Thika superhighway\"], ''The Nation'', 5 November 2012.</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2017, The current president [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] inaugurated the Standard Gauge railway which runs from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa.

Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi is currently 4.1% a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> It is estimated that Nairobi's population will reach 5 million in 2025.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=26125 |title=Build cities to contain population explosion |last=Oronje |first=Rose |date=July 27, 2005 |work=The Standard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174509/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/print/news.php?articleid=26125 |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nThese data fit remarkably closely (r^2 = 0.9994) to a logistic curve with t(0) = 1900, P(0)=8500, r = 0.059 and K = 8,000,000. This suggests a current (2011) growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5&nbsp;million in 2025.\n\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oyugi|first=Maurice Onyango|last2=K\u2019Akumu|first2=Owiti A.|title=Land use management challenges for the city of Nairobi|journal=Urban Forum|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=94\u2013113|doi=10.1007/BF02681232|issn=1015-3802|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[Kenya National Theatre]], and the [[Kenya National Archives]].

Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]] and [[Meja Mwangi]] who were part of post-colonial writing.\n\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\n\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is ''[[Out of Africa]]''. The book was written by [[Karen Blixen]], whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in [[Kenya]]. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], is named after her.\n\nIn 1985, ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' was made into a film, directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. The film won 28 awards, including seven [[Academy Awards]]. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's [[Karen Blixen Museum (Kenya)|Karen Blixen Museum]].\n\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]], Kenya's foremost writer.\n\nNairobi has been the set of several other [[Cinema of the United States|American]] and [[British Film Industry|British]] films. The most recent of these was ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the [[Kibera]] slum.\n\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is [[Lupita Nyong'o]]. Lupita received an Oscar award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|best supporting actress]] in her role as Patsy in the film ''[[12 Years a Slave]]'' during the ''[[86th Academy Awards]]'' at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\n\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinemas]] in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series ''[[Sense8]]'' which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in [[The Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB).\n\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film ''[[Eye in the Sky (2015 film)|Eye in the Sky]]'', which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series [[Money Heist]].\n\n===Food===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to ''[[nyama choma]]'' which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as [[KFC]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Hardee's]] and [[Burger King]] which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, [[Galittos]], [[Steers]], [[PizzaMojo]], [[Spur Steak Ranches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing?lite |title=Fast food finds fans in sub-Sahara Africa, where obesity problem is growing \u2013 World News |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, [[Nairobi Java House]] and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\n\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eatout.co.ke/nairobi-restaurant-week |title=Nairobi Restaurant Week 2016 |last=Kenya |first=EatOut |website=eatout.co.ke |access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref> NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n===Music===\n\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. [[Benga music|Benga]] is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of [[jazz]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]] music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\n\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the [[African Great Lakes]]. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of [[soukous]] music. This genre was originally developed in [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. After the political climate in the region [[Congo Crisis|deteriorated]], many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as [[Super Mazembe|Orchestra Super Mazembe]] moved from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] to Nairobi and found great success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orchestra Super Mazembe |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |accessdate=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231064112/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |archivedate=31 December 2007}}</ref> [[Virgin records]] became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several [[soukous]] artists.\n\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the [[Kenyan hip hop]] scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenyan. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Successful artists based in Nairobi include [[Jua Cali]], [[Nonini]], Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and [[David Mathenge|Nameless]]. Popular Record labels include [[Ogopa DJs]], Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, [[Calif Records]] and Bornblack Music Group.\n\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi.

Acts that have performed in Nairobi include Lost Boyz, [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]], [[Akon]], Eve, T.O.K, [[Sean Paul]], [[Wayne Wonder]], [[Alaine]], Konshens, [[Ja Rule]], and [[Morgan Heritage]], and Cabo Snoop. Other international musicians who have performed in Nairobi include the rocking show by Don Carlos, Demarco, Busy Signal, Mr. Vegas and the Elephant man crew.\n\nNairobi, including the coastal towns of Mombasa and Diani, have recently become the centre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in Kenya producing DJs as well as producers like Suraj, Jack Rooster, Euggy, [[DJ Fita]], Noise on Demand, DJ Vidza, DJ Coco EM. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Prominent international composers and DJs have also toured in Nairobi, including [[Diplo]], [[Major Lazer]] [[Kyau & Albert]], Solarity, [[Ronski Speed]], and [[Boom Jinx]].\n\nMany nightclubs in and around the city have witnessed a growth in the population that exclusively listen to Electronic Dance Music, especially amongst the younger generations{{POV statement|date=December 2012}}.

It was established in 1956, as part of the [[University of East Africa]], but became an independent university in 1970. The university has approximately 84,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|title=University of Nairobi Factfile \u2013 UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI|publisher=|access-date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035948/http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Kenyatta University]] is situated {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on {{convert|1100|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. Currently it is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\n[[Strathmore University]] started in 1961 as an [[Advanced Level (UK)]] Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\n* [[United States International University|United States International University \u2013 Nairobi]] was originally a branch of the [[United States International University]], but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\n* In 2005, The [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi]] was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\n[[File:Catholic University of Eastern Africa - garden.jpg|thumb|[[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]]]]\n* The [[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]] located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\n* [[Technical University of Kenya|The Technical University of Kenya]] (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only [[Institute of technology|Technical University]] in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by [[Mwai Kibaki]] in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies. \n* [[KCA University]] (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\n* The Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\n[[File:Umma University.png|thumb|left|400px|[[Umma University]]]]\n* [[Pan African Christian University]] is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\n* [[East Africa Institute of Certified Studies]] (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\n* [[Compugoal College]]\n* [[Riara University]] on Mbagathi road.\n* [[Umma University]] is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.\n\nNumerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n[[File:Syokimau Railway Station.jpg|thumb|300px|Syokimau Railway Station]]\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of [[Thika Road]] has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor|LAPPSET]] project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\n\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to [[Kisumu]].\n\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\n\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\n\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the [[President of Kenya]] Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened ''Madaraka Express'' currently operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n====Airports====\n[[File:Nairobi Arrivals Terminal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]]]\n[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the [[FAA]] boosting the airport's status as a Regional Aviation hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001232614/aviation-sector-in-new-high-as-passenger-numbers-hit-record-10-million|title=Aviation sector in new high as passenger numbers hit record 10 million|first=Frankline|last=Sunday|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Wilson Airport]] is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000210004/wilson-airport-builds-sh163m-tower-amidst-land-grabbing-claims|title=Wilson Airport builds Sh163m tower amidst land grabbing claims|first=Peter|last=Muiruri|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Eastleigh Airport]] is a military base airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-[[jet aircraft|jet]] airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from [[Southampton]] to [[Cape Town]] in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by [[flying boat]]s between Britain and [[Kisumu]] and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n====Matatu====\n[[File:A matatu.jpg|thumb|A matatu]]\n{{main|Matatu}}\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\n[[Matatu]], which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport.<ref>{{cite web|last=United Nations Offices Nairobi Interns |title=How to get around Nairobi |publisher=interns.unon.org |url=http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075002/http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2007 |accessdate=5 July 2007 }}</ref> They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite [[association football|football]] team or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist. More recently, some have even painted [[Barack Obama]]'s face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\n\nHowever, in 2004, a [[Seat belt legislation|law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts]] and [[speed governor]]s and to be painted with a yellow stripe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crackdown hits Kenyan commuters|publisher=BBC|date=2 February 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|accessdate=3 July 2006 }}</ref> At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n====Buses====\n[[File:Nairobi Public Transport.jpg|thumb|Public transport in Nairobi]]\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\n\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n====Trains====\nNairobi was founded as a [[railway town]], and the main headquarters of [[Kenya Railways|Kenya Railways (KR)]] is still situated at [[Nairobi railway station]], which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from [[Mombasa]] to [[Kampala]]. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and [[Kisumu]]. A number of morning and evening commuter [[Nairobi rail service|trains]] connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\n\nThe new [[Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway]] connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The [[Nairobi Terminus]] is located at [[Syokimau]], some 20&nbsp;km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Museam hill interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Museum hill interchange, where Uhuru highway links to forest road which is an extension of the Thika superhighway. Nairobi's tall skyscrapers can be seen on the background.]]\n[[File:The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD]]\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. [[Ongata Rongai]], Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by [[Thika Road]], Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\n\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), [[Eldoret]], [[Kisumu]], [[Nakuru]], [[Naivasha]], and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\n\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n[[File:Eastern Bypass, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|Eastern Bypass, Nairobi]]\n\n====Private car population projection for Nairobi====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This approach became popular in the late 1980s with the exploration of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and B-C-N ternary compounds. The second approach towards designing superhard materials incorporates these lighter elements (B, C, N, and O), but also introduces transition metals with high valence electron densities to provide high incompressibility. In this way, metals with high bulk moduli but low hardness are coordinated with small covalent-forming atoms to produce superhard materials. Tungsten carbide is an industrially-relevant manifestation of this approach, although it is not considered superhard. Alternatively, borides combined with transition metals have become a rich area of superhard research and have led to discoveries such as ReB<sub>2</sub>, OsB<sub>2</sub>, and WB<sub>4</sub>.\n\nSuperhard materials can be generally classified into two categories: intrinsic compounds and extrinsic compounds. The intrinsic group includes [[diamond]], [[cubic boron nitride]] (c-BN), [[Beta carbon nitride|carbon nitrides]] and ternary compounds such as B-N-C, which possess an innate hardness.

A superhard material has high [[shear modulus]], high [[bulk modulus]] and does not deform [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]]. Ideally superhard materials should have a defect-free, isotropic lattice. This greatly reduces structural deformations that can lower the strength of the material. However, defects can actually strengthen some covalent structures. Traditionally, high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions have been used to synthesize superhard materials, but recent superhard material syntheses aim at using less energy and lower cost materials.<ref name=Levine/><ref name=Haines/>\n\nHistorically, hardness was first defined as the ability of one material to scratch another and quantified by an integer (sometimes half-integer) from 0 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. This scale was however quickly found too discrete and non-linear. Measuring the mechanical hardness of materials changed to using a [[nanoindenter]] (usually made of diamond) and evaluating bulk moduli, and the [[Brinell scale|Brinell]], [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Knoop hardness test|Knoop]] and [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]] scales have been developed. Whereas the Vickers scale is widely accepted as a most common test,<ref name=Haines/> there remain controversies on the weight load to be applied during the test. This is because Vickers hardness values are load-dependent. An indent made with 0.5N will indicate a higher hardness value than an indent made with 50N. This phenomenon is known as the indentation size effect (ISE). Thus, hardness values are not meaningful unless the load is also reported. Some argue that hardness values should consistently be reported in the asymptotic (high-load region), as this is a more standardized representation of a material's hardness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Y.|last2=Solozhenko|first2=V.|last3=Riedel|first3=R.|last4=Novikov|first4=N.|last5=Nicol|first5=M.|last6=Dubrovinskaia|first6=N.|last7=Brazhkin|first7=V.|date=2004|title=What does 'harder than diamond' mean?|journal=Nature Materials|language=en|volume=3|issue=9|pages=576\u2013577|doi=10.1038/nmat1196|issn=1476-4660}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align=\"center\" \n|+ [[Vickers hardness]] of selected hard materials<ref>{{cite journal| title = Ultimate Metastable Solubility of Boron in Diamond: Synthesis of Superhard Diamondlike BC<sub>5</sub>| author = Solozhenko, V.

The incompressibility of a material is quantified by the bulk modulus B, which measures the resistance of a solid to volume compression under [[hydrostatic stress]] as B = \u2212Vdp/dV. Here V is the volume, p is pressure, and dp/dV is the partial derivative of pressure with respect to the volume. The bulk modulus test uses an indenter tool to form a permanent deformation in a material. The size of the deformation depends on the material's resistance to the volume compression made by the tool. Elements with small molar volumes and strong interatomic forces usually have high bulk moduli. Bulk moduli was the first major test of hardness and originally shown to be correlated with the molar volume (V<sub>m</sub>) and cohesive energy (E<sub>c</sub>) as B ~ E<sub>c</sub>/V<sub>m</sub> Bulk modulus was believed to be a direct measure of a material's hardness but this no longer remains the dominant school of thought. For example, some [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[noble metal]]s (Pd, Ag) have anomalously high ratio of the bulk modulus to the Vickers of Brinell hardness. In the early 2000s, a direct relationship between bulk modulus and valence electron density was found as the more electrons were present the greater the repulsions within the structure were.<ref name=Levine/> Bulk modulus is still used as a preliminary measure of a material as superhard but it is now known that other properties must be taken into account.<ref name=Levine/><ref name=Haines/>\n\nIn contrast to bulk modulus, shear modulus measures the resistance to shape change at a constant volume, taking into account the crystalline plane and direction of shear. The shear modulus G is defined as ratio of shear stress to shear strain: G = stress/strain = F\u00b7L/(A\u00b7dx), where F is the applied force, A is the area upon which the force acts, dx is the resulting displacement and L is the initial length. The larger the shear modulus, the greater the ability for a material to resist shearing forces. Therefore, the shear modulus is a measure of rigidity. Shear modulus is related to bulk modulus as {{nowrap|3/G {{=}} 2B(1 \u2212 2v)(1 + v)}}, where v is the Poisson's ratio, which is typically ~0.1 in covalent materials. If a material contains highly directional bonds, the shear modulus will increase and give a low Poisson ratio.\n\nA material is also considered hard if it resists plastic deformation. If a material has short covalent bonds, atomic dislocations that lead to plastic deformation are less likely to occur than in materials with longer, delocalized bonds. If a material contains many delocalized bonds it is likely to be soft.<ref name=Levine/> Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property [[fracture toughness]], which is a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact (note that this concept is distinct from the notion of [[toughness]]). A superhard material is not necessarily \"supertough\". For example, the fracture toughness of diamond is about 7\u201310 [[Megapascal|MPa]]\u00b7m<sup>1/2</sup>,<ref>\n{{cite book |author=Lee, J. |author2=Novikov N.

While hard materials have high bulk moduli, a high bulk modulus does not mean a material is hard. Inelastic characteristics must be considered as well, and shear modulus might even provide a better correlation with hardness than bulk modulus. Covalent materials generally have high bond-bending force constants and high shear moduli and are more likely to give superhard structures than, for example, ionic solids.<ref name=Levine/><ref name=Haines/>\n\n==Diamond==\n[[File:Diamond and graphite2.jpg|thumb|left|Diamond and graphite materials and structure]]\n[[Diamond]] is an allotrope of carbon where the atoms are arranged in a modified version of [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') structure known as \"[[diamond cubic]]\".

The short B-N (1.57 \u00c5) bond is close to the diamond C-C bond length (1.54 \u00c5), that results in strong covalent bonding between atoms in the same fashion as in diamond. The slight decrease in covalency for B-N bonds compared to C-C bonds reduces the hardness from ~100 GPa for diamond down to 48 GPa in c-BN. As diamond is less stable than graphite, c-BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature.<ref name=bn1/>\n\nCubic boron nitride is insoluble in iron, nickel, and related alloys at high temperatures, but it binds well with metals due to formation of interlayers of metal borides and nitrides.

They are expected to be thermally and chemically more stable than diamond, and harder than c-BN, and would therefore be excellent materials for high speed cutting and polishing of ferrous alloys.

When looking at the boron and osmium atoms in the ''a'' and ''b'' directions, they are arranged in a way that is offset from one another. Therefore, when they are compressed they are not pushed right up against one another. Electrostatic repulsion is the force that maximizes the materials incompressibility and so in this case the electrostatic repulsion is not taken full advantage of. When compressed in the ''c'' direction, the osmium and boron atoms are almost directly in line with one another and the electrostatic repulsion is therefore high, causing direction ''c'' to be the least compressible. This model implies that if boron is more evenly distributed throughout the lattice then incompressibility could be higher. [[Electron backscatter diffraction]] coupled with hardness measurements reveals that in the (010) plane, the crystal is 54% harder in the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|<100>]] than <001> direction. This is seen by looking at how long the indentation is along a certain direction (related to the indentations made with a Vickers hardness test). Along with the alignment of the atoms, this is also due to the short covalent B-B (1.80 \u00c5) bonds in the <100> direction, which are absent in the <001> direction (B-B = 4.10 \u00c5).<ref name=Levine/>\n\n===Rhenium borides===\nRhenium was targeted as a candidate for superhard metal borides because of its desirable physical and chemical characteristics.

Because molecular defects affect the superhard properties of bulk materials it is obvious that the microstructure of superhard materials give the materials their unique properties. Focus on synthesizing nano superhard materials is around minimizing microcracks occurring within the structure through grain boundary hardening. The elimination of microcracks can strengthen the material by 3 to 7 times its original strength.

Besides grain boundary strengthening, much attention has been put into building [[Heterostructure#Nanoscale heterojunctions|microheterostructures]], or nanostructures of two materials with very large differences in elastic moduli. Heterostructures were first proposed in 1970 and contained such highly ordered thin layers that they could not theoretically be separated by mechanical means. These highly ordered heterostructures were believed to be stronger than simple mixtures. This theory was confirmed with Al/Cu and Al/Ag structures. After the formation of Al/Cu and Al/Ag, the research was extended to multilayer systems including Cu/Ni, TiN/VN, W/WN, Hf/HfN and more.

This approach became popular in the late 1980s with the exploration of C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and B-C-N ternary compounds. The second approach towards designing superhard materials incorporates these lighter elements (B, C, N, and O), but also introduces transition metals with high valence electron densities to provide high incompressibility. In this way, metals with high bulk moduli but low hardness are coordinated with small covalent-forming atoms to produce superhard materials. Tungsten carbide is an industrially-relevant manifestation of this approach, although it is not considered superhard. Alternatively, borides combined with transition metals have become a rich area of superhard research and have led to discoveries such as ReB<sub>2</sub>, OsB<sub>2</sub>, and WB<sub>4</sub>.\n\nSuperhard materials can be generally classified into two categories: intrinsic compounds and extrinsic compounds.

A superhard material has high [[shear modulus]], high [[bulk modulus]] and does not deform [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]]. Ideally superhard materials should have a defect-free, isotropic lattice. This greatly reduces structural deformations that can lower the strength of the material. However, defects can actually strengthen some covalent structures. Traditionally, high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions have been used to synthesize superhard materials, but recent superhard material syntheses aim at using less energy and lower cost materials.<ref name=Levine/><ref name=Haines/>\n\nHistorically, hardness was first defined as the ability of one material to scratch another and quantified by an integer (sometimes half-integer) from 0 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. This scale was however quickly found too discrete and non-linear. Measuring the mechanical hardness of materials changed to using a [[nanoindenter]] (usually made of diamond) and evaluating bulk moduli, and the [[Brinell scale|Brinell]], [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Knoop hardness test|Knoop]] and [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]] scales have been developed. Whereas the Vickers scale is widely accepted as a most common test,<ref name=Haines/> there remain controversies on the weight load to be applied during the test. This is because Vickers hardness values are load-dependent. An indent made with 0.5N will indicate a higher hardness value than an indent made with 50N. This phenomenon is known as the indentation size effect (ISE). Thus, hardness values are not meaningful unless the load is also reported. Some argue that hardness values should consistently be reported in the asymptotic (high-load region), as this is a more standardized representation of a material's hardness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Y.|last2=Solozhenko|first2=V.|last3=Riedel|first3=R.|last4=Novikov|first4=N.|last5=Nicol|first5=M.|last6=Dubrovinskaia|first6=N.|last7=Brazhkin|first7=V.|date=2004|title=What does 'harder than diamond' mean?|journal=Nature Materials|language=en|volume=3|issue=9|pages=576\u2013577|doi=10.1038/nmat1196|issn=1476-4660}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align=\"center\" \n|+ [[Vickers hardness]] of selected hard materials<ref>{{cite journal| title = Ultimate Metastable Solubility of Boron in Diamond: Synthesis of Superhard Diamondlike BC<sub>5</sub>| author = Solozhenko, V.

The incompressibility of a material is quantified by the bulk modulus B, which measures the resistance of a solid to volume compression under [[hydrostatic stress]] as B = \u2212Vdp/dV. Here V is the volume, p is pressure, and dp/dV is the partial derivative of pressure with respect to the volume. The bulk modulus test uses an indenter tool to form a permanent deformation in a material. The size of the deformation depends on the material's resistance to the volume compression made by the tool. Elements with small molar volumes and strong interatomic forces usually have high bulk moduli. Bulk moduli was the first major test of hardness and originally shown to be correlated with the molar volume (V<sub>m</sub>) and cohesive energy (E<sub>c</sub>) as B ~ E<sub>c</sub>/V<sub>m</sub> Bulk modulus was believed to be a direct measure of a material's hardness but this no longer remains the dominant school of thought. For example, some [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[noble metal]]s (Pd, Ag) have anomalously high ratio of the bulk modulus to the Vickers of Brinell hardness. In the early 2000s, a direct relationship between bulk modulus and valence electron density was found as the more electrons were present the greater the repulsions within the structure were.<ref name=Levine/> Bulk modulus is still used as a preliminary measure of a material as superhard but it is now known that other properties must be taken into account.<ref name=Levine/><ref name=Haines/>\n\nIn contrast to bulk modulus, shear modulus measures the resistance to shape change at a constant volume, taking into account the crystalline plane and direction of shear. The shear modulus G is defined as ratio of shear stress to shear strain: G = stress/strain = F\u00b7L/(A\u00b7dx), where F is the applied force, A is the area upon which the force acts, dx is the resulting displacement and L is the initial length. The larger the shear modulus, the greater the ability for a material to resist shearing forces. Therefore, the shear modulus is a measure of rigidity. Shear modulus is related to bulk modulus as {{nowrap|3/G {{=}} 2B(1 \u2212 2v)(1 + v)}}, where v is the Poisson's ratio, which is typically ~0.1 in covalent materials. If a material contains highly directional bonds, the shear modulus will increase and give a low Poisson ratio.\n\nA material is also considered hard if it resists plastic deformation. If a material has short covalent bonds, atomic dislocations that lead to plastic deformation are less likely to occur than in materials with longer, delocalized bonds. If a material contains many delocalized bonds it is likely to be soft.<ref name=Levine/> Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property [[fracture toughness]], which is a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact (note that this concept is distinct from the notion of [[toughness]]). A superhard material is not necessarily \"supertough\". For example, the fracture toughness of diamond is about 7\u201310 [[Megapascal|MPa]]\u00b7m<sup>1/2</sup>,<ref>\n{{cite book |author=Lee, J. |author2=Novikov N.

While hard materials have high bulk moduli, a high bulk modulus does not mean a material is hard. Inelastic characteristics must be considered as well, and shear modulus might even provide a better correlation with hardness than bulk modulus. Covalent materials generally have high bond-bending force constants and high shear moduli and are more likely to give superhard structures than, for example, ionic solids.<ref name=Levine/><ref name=Haines/>\n\n==Diamond==\n[[File:Diamond and graphite2.jpg|thumb|left|Diamond and graphite materials and structure]]\n[[Diamond]] is an allotrope of carbon where the atoms are arranged in a modified version of [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') structure known as \"[[diamond cubic]]\".

When looking at the boron and osmium atoms in the ''a'' and ''b'' directions, they are arranged in a way that is offset from one another. Therefore, when they are compressed they are not pushed right up against one another. Electrostatic repulsion is the force that maximizes the materials incompressibility and so in this case the electrostatic repulsion is not taken full advantage of. When compressed in the ''c'' direction, the osmium and boron atoms are almost directly in line with one another and the electrostatic repulsion is therefore high, causing direction ''c'' to be the least compressible. This model implies that if boron is more evenly distributed throughout the lattice then incompressibility could be higher. [[Electron backscatter diffraction]] coupled with hardness measurements reveals that in the (010) plane, the crystal is 54% harder in the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|<100>]] than <001> direction. This is seen by looking at how long the indentation is along a certain direction (related to the indentations made with a Vickers hardness test).

Because molecular defects affect the superhard properties of bulk materials it is obvious that the microstructure of superhard materials give the materials their unique properties. Focus on synthesizing nano superhard materials is around minimizing microcracks occurring within the structure through grain boundary hardening. The elimination of microcracks can strengthen the material by 3 to 7 times its original strength. [[Grain boundary strengthening]] is described by the [[Grain boundary strengthening#Hall\u2013Petch relationship|Hall-Petch]] equation<ref name=crack>Bouchaud, Elisabeth; Jeulin, Dominique and Prioul, Claude (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uRijGxzu16sC&pg=PA23 ''Physical aspects of fracture''].

There have been many mechanisms proposed for [[grain boundary sliding]] and hence material softening, but the details are still not understood. Besides grain boundary strengthening, much attention has been put into building [[Heterostructure#Nanoscale heterojunctions|microheterostructures]], or nanostructures of two materials with very large differences in elastic moduli. Heterostructures were first proposed in 1970 and contained such highly ordered thin layers that they could not theoretically be separated by mechanical means. These highly ordered heterostructures were believed to be stronger than simple mixtures. This theory was confirmed with Al/Cu and Al/Ag structures. After the formation of Al/Cu and Al/Ag, the research was extended to multilayer systems including Cu/Ni, TiN/VN, W/WN, Hf/HfN and more. In all cases, decreasing the lattice period increased the hardness.<ref name= Veprek/> One common form of a nanostructured material is [[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s, which is harder than bulk diamond and is currently the hardest (~150 GPa) material known.<ref name=blank>{{cite journal|last1=Blank |first1=V |title=Ultrahard and superhard phases of fullerite C60: Comparison with diamond on hardness and wear |url=http://nanoscan.info/wp-content/publications/article_03.pdf |journal=Diamond and Related Materials |volume=7 |pages=427 |date=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(97)00232-X |issue=2\u20135 |bibcode=1998DRM.....7..427B |last2=Popov |first2=M. |last3=Pivovarov |first3=G. |last4=Lvova |first4=N. |last5=Gogolinsky |first5=K. |last6=Reshetov |first6=V. |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225258/http://nanoscan.info/wp-content/publications/article_03.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |citeseerx=10.1.1.520.7265 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Beta carbon nitride]]\n*[[Borazon]]\n*[[Iron tetraboride]]\n*[[Lonsdaleite]]\n*[[Aluminium magnesium boride]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Superhard Materials}}\n[[Category:Superhard materials| ]]\n[[Category:Materials]]\n[[Category:Diamond]]\n", "name_user": "2606:6000:6642:3c00:44b4:ffeb:6bd5:31a5", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200enetherite)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhard_material"}

I'm not certain if the idea was first suggested by Chris Claremont, the late, much-missed Dave Cockrum, or John Byrne when he came aboard as artist, but it most certainly ''did not'' start with me.<ref name=\"saywhat\">{{cite web | url=http://lenwein.blogspot.com/2009/02/say-what.html#links | title=WeinWords | last=Wein | first=Len | work=Say What? | date=February 24, 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nWein said on the ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' [[Blu-ray]] special features that he has read \"Ten things you did not know about Wolverine\", which says the character was originally intended to be a mutated wolverine cub, and that this rekindled Wein's frustration. He again stated that he had \"always known that Wolverine was a mutant.\"\n\nIn an article about the evolution of Wolverine included in a 1986 reprint of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180\u2013181, titled ''Incredible Hulk and Wolverine'', Cockrum said he considered having the High Evolutionary play a vital role in making Wolverine a human.<ref name=\"Sanderson\" /> Writer Wein wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult, with superhuman strength and agility similar to [[Spider-Man]]. This changed when Wein saw Cockrum's drawing of the unmasked Wolverine as a hairy 40-year-old.<ref name=\"Sanderson\" /> Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine's gloves, and both gloves and claws would be made of [[adamantium]].<ref name=\"saywhat\" /> Chris Claremont eventually revealed that they were an integrated part of Wolverine's anatomy in ''X-Men'' #98 (April 1976).

They trick him into trying to save his girlfriend Melita Garner (who was [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in disguise) and then trap him in a mystical circle to send him straight to Hell. While he is in Hell, a group of demons possess Wolverine's body. The demons then attack [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]] while he is at church, then they attack [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].

The X-Men find out that Wolverine is possessed and decide that he should die to protect humankind, believing Wolverine would prefer to die rather than kill innocents. Wolverine is attacked on all sides by fighting the demons that still possess him and the X-Men that want him killed. He subsequently tracks down the Red Right Hand and kills their team of killers, the Mongrels. Wolverine fights his way through them only to find that the Red Right Hand's members have all committed suicide, while a pre-recorded message reveals that the Mongrels were all his illegitimate children.

Wolverine returns the children to their families only to be found by Melita and his allies who convince him to come back to civilization.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 4) #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sometime afterward, the events of Fear Itself and before Schism take place.\n\n===Schism===\nAt the beginning of the events of Schism,  Cyclops thanks Wolverine for always being there for him as they seem to finally have come to a mutually spoken and understood respect for each other after years of fighting and rivalry. While at a conference for weapon control, Kid Omega (Quentin Quire) launches a psychic terrorist attack on the ambassadors present. In response, Sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine. Due to growing fears of mutant threats, countries around the world begin to mobilize their Sentinel forces. As Cyclops begins to deploy X-Men around the globe to deal with the threat, Wolverine returns to Utopia to find Hope Summers and the Lights waiting for their combat training lesson. After insulting Hope's team and realizing that Idie is losing her childhood, Wolverine asks Kitty Pryde to make him a doll to give to Idie. Wolverine gives the doll to Idie and eats ice cream with her while news reports of Sentinel activity play and tensions build around Utopia. Sometime after, Kid Omega shows up on Utopia. Wolverine tries to attack Kid Omega when Cyclops stops him. While Cyclops sends a team of some of his most powerful X-Men, as well as some of the island students, to a local mutant museum exhibit as a \"show of force\", Wolverine goes to a local bar to sulk in his aggravation with the current situation. The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitates all senior X-Men present. As Wolverine rushes to the museum to help from the bar and Cyclops flies in from Utopia, Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help. While Wolverine protests against it profusely, Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right. Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors. Wolverine pops his claws at Cyclops in anger that he used a child to save the day, but restrains himself when he realizes what he is doing.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #1\u20133. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFrom the wreckage of the museum, a sentinel begins to form. While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops doesn't listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other comes to a head when Cyclops brings up [[Jean Grey]] saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies \"And if she were here right now, who do you think she would be more frightened of?\" The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops' visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him. While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides to stay out of the others business.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #4\u20135.

[[Toad (comics)|Toad]] is appointed as a janitor. The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application. As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour, Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up. Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, spending all the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> On its first day, it was assaulted by the new [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], who had been a major force in causing the Schism of the X-Men. Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of the kids and fought as hard as he could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself. Then, they were attacked by the Hellfire Club, who were in possession of a spawn of the original [[Krakoa]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n[[Kid Omega]], who wants to prove himself to [[Broo (comics)|Broo]], [[Oya (comics)|Idie]] and Kid Gladiator, reasoned with Krakoa who then joined Wolverine's X-Men. Wolverine confronts the Hellfire Club tells them to stay away from his school, though he admonishes Krakoa not to attack them. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] tells Kade Kilgore that he is being sued by Wolverine for the sum of $879 million for the damage he did to the school. As the school is rebuilt, Logan is informed that Krakoa was glad they allowed him to stay and Logan notes the advantage of school grounds that could defend itself.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #3.

Wolverine found this particularly difficult to do as he was forced to fight those he once thought of as family.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCyclops tries to convince Wolverine to switch sides and become part of the X-Men once more. Wolverine is infuriated, feeling Cyclops has betrayed what the X-Men stood for, and did not have the right to determine who was a part of them.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\nAfter Hope's escape, Wolverine accompanies her to the Blue Area of the Moon. She promises to let Wolverine kill her if she is unable to control the Phoenix Force; her only request is that she gets the chance to control it. However, Wolverine betrays her by summoning the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Phoenix Force begins to bond with Hope, at which point she admits that she cannot contain it. She asks Wolverine to kill her, but he is prevented from doing so by Cyclops.

The shell is cracked when the Reavers attempt to steal Wolverine's corpse and shortly after that attack, Kitty visits the 'real' grave and realizes that it is empty. Kitty contacts Daredevil and Tony Stark for help finding who took Wolverine, but all are left concerned at the questions of who would even know the location of the true grave- which was known only by a few key X-Men- and whether Wolverine was stolen or 'woke up' on his own as the X-Men also began their investigation, leaving the time-displaced Jean Grey alone in the cabin.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine'' #1</ref> At the same time, some of Wolverine's worst enemies hear what happened and join the hunt.{{issue|date=July 2018}}\n\nThere are 4 teams who investigate independently Logan's body disappearing and reappearing:\n\n* In '''Weapon Lost''', vigilante Daredevil, Inhuman detective [[Nur (comics)|Frank McGee]], retired private eye Misty Knight, and multilanguage speaking mutant Cypher search for Logan by following his sightings.

He eventually realizes that he was brought back to life by Persephone, who has used her ability to revive the dead to restore various people to act as her agents and complete certain key assignments to arrange for the construction of a complex satellite network. The completion of this network would allow her to 'kill' humanity and then revive them in a state where she could control the amount of brainpower they possessed, allowing her to use some of them as drones while others would be capable of more independent action to benefit her regime. However, when she revived Logan to assist her, his restoration also reactivated his healing factor, allowing him to come back to life on his own after his assignment for Persephone had concluded, with Logan restoring enough of his memory to accept that he had to destroy Persephone's satellite base, surviving the subsequent crash to Earth.<ref>''Return of Wolverine'' #1-5.

Art by Andy Kubert and Richard Isanove.]]\nWolverine's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant [[Healing|healing factor]], that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities; he has been seen to become intoxicated after ingesting significant amounts of alcohol,<ref>''Wolverine'' #3 (Nov. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons;<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #87 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] once managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA study by the [[University of British Columbia]] states that Wolverine's healing factor resembles the [[Axolotl|axolotl]]'s ability to regenerate lost limbs. It suggests that a novel protein\u2014which the study's authors dubbed Howlett\u2014found in tissue samples taken from him, and which resembles the Amblox protein found in axolotl but is much more efficient, is responsible for Wolverine's rapid regeneration.<ref name=\"ubc201302\">{{cite web | url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/howlett-novel-wolverine-protein-contributes-to-rapid-regeneration-and-heightened-cellular-replication/ | title=Howlett: Novel Wolverine Protein Contributes to Rapid Regeneration and Heightened Cellular Replication | publisher=University of British Columbia | work=Science Creative Quarterly | date=February 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 |author1=Alvarez, Sigrid |author2=Conway, Emma}}</ref> His healing factor is facilitated by artificial improvements he was subjected to under the Weapon X program (in later comics called the Weapon Plus program), in which his skeleton was reinforced with the virtually indestructible metal adamantium. While the adamantium in his body stops or reduces many injuries, his healing factor must also work constantly to prevent metal poisoning from killing him. When his healing powers were rendered inactive, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] synthesized a drug to counteract the adamantium poisoning.<ref name=\"Wolverinevol\"/>\n\nWolverine's healing factor also dramatically affects his aging process, allowing him to live far beyond the normal lifespan of normal humans. Despite being born in the late 19th century,<ref>''Origin''. Marvel Comics.</ref> he has the appearance, conditioning, health and vitality of a man in his physical prime. While seemingly ageless, it is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy.\n\nAlthough Wolverine's body heals, the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #65 (Oct. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #12 (Dec. 2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDepictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary due to a broad degree of artistic license employed by various comic book writers. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds,<ref>''X-Men'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> though [[Chris Claremont]], head writer of the X-Men comics from the mid 1970s to the early 1990s increased Wolverine's healing factor substantially, though not nearly as much as later writers would. During the 1980s, Wolverine's mutant healing factor is depicted as being able to heal massive levels of trauma, though his recovery time could extend to days, weeks or months before fully healing; often depending upon the severity of the injuries, their extent and the frequency with which they're inflicted.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.1 #2 October 1982\">''Wolverine'' #2 (Oct. 1982).

Marvel Comics.</ref> During the 1990s through the modern era, other writers have increased Wolverine's healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #92 (Aug. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #115 (Aug. 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #150 (Feb. 2004).

Marvel Comics.</ref> and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #43 (Aug. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> An explanation is given in a recent mini-series starring Wolverine for the increase of his healing powers. In the series, Wolverine is referred to as an \"adaptive self-healer\" after undergoing numerous traumatic injuries to test the efficiency of his healing factor. Wolverine has endured so much trauma, and so frequently, that his healing factor has adapted, becoming faster and more efficient to cope with increasing levels of trauma.<ref>''Wolverine: The Best There Is'' #4 (May 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Xavier Protocols]], a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, say that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to \"incredible levels\" and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to [[decapitation|decapitate]] him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.<ref>''Excalibur'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt is possible to suppress the efficiency of Wolverine's healing powers; for example, if an object composed of [[Adamantium|adamantium]] is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Muramasa]] blade, a [[Katana|katana]] of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine's powers.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #39 (Oct. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> It has also been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning that if he was seriously injured and malnourished, his body might not be able to repair itself.<ref>''Wolverine'' #67 (Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> His healing factor has also been turned off using nanites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Wolverine can be killed by [[Drowning|drowning]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #19 (Dec. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> He has said that he is not particularly fond of being in the water, due partially to the weight of his adamantium laced skeleton, and that he can die if held underwater long enough - his healing factor would only prolong the agony.<ref>''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #5 (Nov. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> The two-part story arc \"Drowning Logan\" finds Wolverine trapped underwater for an extensive period of time.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 5) #5 (Jun. 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> The second part of the story arc hints that this experience weakens his healing factor and future health.<ref>''Wolverine'' #6 & 8 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> Following \"Drowning Logan\", [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] reveals that an \"intelligent virus\" originating from the [[Microverse]] has shut off his healing factor, though not before it purged his body of the virus, leaving him as susceptible to injury, disease, and aging as any ordinary human.<ref name=\"Wolverinevol\">''Wolverine'' (vol. 5) #7 (July 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #57 reveals that when Wolverine is injured so seriously that his body actually dies before his healing factor can repair the damage, he returns to life by fighting with Azrael, the Angel of Death, while trapped in Purgatory because Wolverine defeated Azrael in real-world combat during World War I.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after Wolverine's resurrection and brainwashing by the Hand, he made a new deal with Azrael that repaired the damage to his soul, negated their previous arrangement, and weakened his healing factor slightly - and the next time Wolverine sustains death-inducing injuries, he will remain dead.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #61. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDue to a combination of Wolverine's healing factor and high-level [[Psionics|psionic]] shields implanted by Professor Xavier, Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to [[Telepathy|telepathic]] assault and probing.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #46 (Nov. 2006)</ref> Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as \"mental scar tissue\" created by the traumatic events of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''X-Men: Original Sin'' (Dec.  2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Other abilities===\nWolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,<ref>''Wolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #75. Marvel Comics.</ref> The claws are not made of [[keratin]], as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #77. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.<ref>''Wolverine'', #75. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n[[File:Wolverine Weapon X Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wolverine's claws in ''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #1 (June 2009). Art by Ron Garney.]]\nWolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify [[shapeshifting]] mutants despite other forms they may take.<ref name=\"Wolverine 1992\">''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #51 (Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, as a type of natural [[lie detector]], such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.<ref>Claremont, Chris (w), [[Davis, Alan]] [[Farmer, Mark]] (i). \"Impediments\", ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #451 (December 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #9 (Feb. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOn more than one occasion, Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, has been molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material, including most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]], which is made out of a proto-adamantium-[[vibranium]] [[alloy]]. Vibranium alone is not comparable in terms of durability with adamantium and has been broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. His claws can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #91, #101</ref> The adamantium also adds weight to his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.1 #2 October 1982\"/> His adamantium skeleton makes him highly susceptible to magnetic-based attacks.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #25 (Oct. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> According to [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], Wolverine would be unable to move without his enhanced strength due to the additional weight of the adamantium bonded to his skeleton.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' vol.1 #1 (Nov. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWolverine's healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #5.

[...] With them, killing is a last resort. With me, it's second nature. I take the world as it is, and give better than I get. Come at me with a sword. I'll meet you with a sword. You want mercy. Show a little first. [...] Some of those folks died fighting... some praying... some accepted their fate... some cursed it... some begged for their lives... most were terrified. Details don't matter. What's important is that they died. And those scales have to be balanced. In-kind.\"</ref>\n\nIn contrast to his brutish nature, Wolverine is extremely knowledgeable. Due to his longer lifespan, he has traveled around the world and amassed [[Polyglotism|extensive knowledge of foreign languages]] and cultures. He is fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Arab language|Arabic]], and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]; he also has some knowledge of [[French language|French]], [[Tagalog language|Filipino]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Hindi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Persian language|Persian]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[German language|German]],<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2). #37 (March 1991).

He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures, though he is a reliable ally and capable leader. He has been a mentor and father figure to several younger women, especially [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Kitty Pryde]] and [[X-23]], and has had failed romantic relationships with numerous women (most notably [[Mariko Yashida]]).<ref>''Wolverine''. #1\u20134 (Sept.-Dec. 1982).

For example, an issue of ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' featured a planet of Wolverines. In the ''[[Marvel Mangaverse]]'', Wolverine is even the founder of the X-Men. In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Wolverine appears zombified alongside Marvel's other major players. The [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics sought to ingrain Wolverine into its ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' title from the onset. The \"[[Old Man Logan]]\" storyline is set in an alternate timeline 50 years into the future where the world's superhuman heroes are dead; Wolverine has aged considerably and has become a [[pacifist]].\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Wolverine in other media}}\n[[File:Wolverine AKA James \"Logan\" Howlett.png|upright|thumb|[[Hugh Jackman]] portrays Wolverine in the X-Men film series.]]\nWolverine is one of the few X-Men characters appearing in every media adaptation of the ''X-Men'' franchise, including film, television, and computer and video games. Australian actor [[Hugh Jackman]] plays Wolverine in the ''X-Men'' films and holds the [[Guinness World Record]] of the 'longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/2/hugh-jackman-surprised-with-record-title-to-mark-16-year-wolverine-career-561491|title=Hugh Jackman surprised with record title to mark 17-year Wolverine career|date=February 19, 2019|work=[[Guinness World Records]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nWolverine topped ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time list.<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05230810thgreatestcharacters3.html \"200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time\"].

[[Gil Kane]] illustrated the cover artwork but incorrectly drew Wolverine's mask with larger headpieces.

The character's growing popularity led to a solo, four-issue, ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' (September\u2013December 1982), by Claremont and Frank Miller, followed by the six-issue ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' by Claremont and [[Al Milgrom]] (Nov. 1984&nbsp;\u2013 April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by [[John Buscema]] in November 1988. It ran for 189 issues. [[Larry Hama]] later took over the series and had an extensive run.

Wolverine is attacked on all sides by fighting the demons that still possess him and the X-Men that want him killed. He subsequently tracks down the Red Right Hand and kills their team of killers, the Mongrels. Wolverine fights his way through them only to find that the Red Right Hand's members have all committed suicide, while a pre-recorded message reveals that the Mongrels were all his illegitimate children.

While at a conference for weapon control, Kid Omega (Quentin Quire) launches a psychic terrorist attack on the ambassadors present. In response, Sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine. Due to growing fears of mutant threats, countries around the world begin to mobilize their Sentinel forces. As Cyclops begins to deploy X-Men around the globe to deal with the threat, Wolverine returns to Utopia to find Hope Summers and the Lights waiting for their combat training lesson. After insulting Hope's team and realizing that Idie is losing her childhood, Wolverine asks Kitty Pryde to make him a doll to give to Idie. Wolverine gives the doll to Idie and eats ice cream with her while news reports of Sentinel activity play and tensions build around Utopia. Sometime after, Kid Omega shows up on Utopia. Wolverine tries to attack Kid Omega when Cyclops stops him. While Cyclops sends a team of some of his most powerful X-Men, as well as some of the island students, to a local mutant museum exhibit as a \"show of force\", Wolverine goes to a local bar to sulk in his aggravation with the current situation. The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitates all senior X-Men present. As Wolverine rushes to the museum to help from the bar and Cyclops flies in from Utopia, Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help. While Wolverine protests against it profusely, Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right. Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors. Wolverine pops his claws at Cyclops in anger that he used a child to save the day, but restrains himself when he realizes what he is doing.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #1\u20133. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFrom the wreckage of the museum, a sentinel begins to form. While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops doesn't listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other comes to a head when Cyclops brings up [[Jean Grey]] saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies \"And if she were here right now, who do you think she would be more frightened of?\" The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops' visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him. While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides to stay out of the others business.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #4\u20135.

[[Toad (comics)|Toad]] is appointed as a janitor. The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application. As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour, Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up.

Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of the kids and fought as hard as he could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself. Then, they were attacked by the Hellfire Club, who were in possession of a spawn of the original [[Krakoa]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #2.

However, when she revived Logan to assist her, his restoration also reactivated his healing factor, allowing him to come back to life on his own after his assignment for Persephone had concluded, with Logan restoring enough of his memory to accept that he had to destroy Persephone's satellite base, surviving the subsequent crash to Earth.<ref>''Return of Wolverine'' #1-5.

The two longtime friends then say their goodbyes to each other, with Kurt assuring Logan that he need not worry about the fate of his soul, as he will be waiting to welcome him into [[Heaven in Christianity|the afterlife]]. As Nightcrawler is disintegrated moments after arriving by the intense heat of the sun, Wolverine's body immediately ignites into flames and he succeeds in cutting through the coupling before he and the [[Self-awareness|awakening]] Mother Mold are vaporized as they fall into the sun.<ref>''House of X'' #4.

Art by Andy Kubert and Richard Isanove.]]\nWolverine's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant [[Healing|healing factor]], that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities; he has been seen to become intoxicated after ingesting significant amounts of alcohol,<ref>''Wolverine'' #3 (Nov. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons;<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #87 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] once managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA study by the [[University of British Columbia]] states that Wolverine's healing factor resembles the [[Axolotl|axolotl]]'s ability to regenerate lost limbs. It suggests that a novel protein\u2014which the study's authors dubbed Howlett\u2014found in tissue samples taken from him, and which resembles the Amblox protein found in axolotl but is much more efficient, is responsible for Wolverine's rapid regeneration.<ref name=\"ubc201302\">{{cite web | url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/howlett-novel-wolverine-protein-contributes-to-rapid-regeneration-and-heightened-cellular-replication/ | title=Howlett: Novel Wolverine Protein Contributes to Rapid Regeneration and Heightened Cellular Replication | publisher=University of British Columbia | work=Science Creative Quarterly | date=February 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2013 |author1=Alvarez, Sigrid |author2=Conway, Emma}}</ref> His healing factor is facilitated by artificial improvements he was subjected to under the Weapon X program (in later comics called the Weapon Plus program), in which his skeleton was reinforced with the virtually indestructible metal adamantium. While the adamantium in his body stops or reduces many injuries, his healing factor must also work constantly to prevent metal poisoning from killing him. When his healing powers were rendered inactive, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] synthesized a drug to counteract the adamantium poisoning.<ref name=\"Wolverinevol\"/>\n\nWolverine's healing factor also dramatically affects his aging process, allowing him to live far beyond the normal lifespan of normal humans. Despite being born in the late 19th century,<ref>''Origin''. Marvel Comics.</ref> he has the appearance, conditioning, health and vitality of a man in his physical prime. While seemingly ageless, it is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy.\n\nAlthough Wolverine's body heals, the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #65 (Oct. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #12 (Dec. 2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDepictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary due to a broad degree of artistic license employed by various comic book writers. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds,<ref>''X-Men'' #107 (Oct. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref> though [[Chris Claremont]], head writer of the X-Men comics from the mid 1970s to the early 1990s increased Wolverine's healing factor substantially, though not nearly as much as later writers would. During the 1980s, Wolverine's mutant healing factor is depicted as being able to heal massive levels of trauma, though his recovery time could extend to days, weeks or months before fully healing; often depending upon the severity of the injuries, their extent and the frequency with which they're inflicted.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.1 #2 October 1982\">''Wolverine'' #2 (Oct. 1982).

Marvel Comics.</ref> During the 1990s through the modern era, other writers have increased Wolverine's healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #92 (Aug. 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #115 (Aug. 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #150 (Feb. 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine's healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an [[atomic explosion]]<ref>''Logan'' #2 (June 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #43 (Aug. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> An explanation is given in a recent mini-series starring Wolverine for the increase of his healing powers. In the series, Wolverine is referred to as an \"adaptive self-healer\" after undergoing numerous traumatic injuries to test the efficiency of his healing factor. Wolverine has endured so much trauma, and so frequently, that his healing factor has adapted, becoming faster and more efficient to cope with increasing levels of trauma.<ref>''Wolverine: The Best There Is'' #4 (May 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Xavier Protocols]], a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, say that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to \"incredible levels\" and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to [[decapitation|decapitate]] him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.<ref>''Excalibur'' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt is possible to suppress the efficiency of Wolverine's healing powers; for example, if an object composed of [[Adamantium|adamantium]] is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The [[Muramasa]] blade, a [[Katana|katana]] of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine's powers.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #39 (Oct. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> It has also been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning that if he was seriously injured and malnourished, his body might not be able to repair itself.<ref>''Wolverine'' #67 (Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> His healing factor has also been turned off using nanites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Wolverine can be killed by [[Drowning|drowning]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #19 (Dec. 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> He has said that he is not particularly fond of being in the water, due partially to the weight of his adamantium laced skeleton, and that he can die if held underwater long enough - his healing factor would only prolong the agony.<ref>''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #5 (Nov. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> The two-part story arc \"Drowning Logan\" finds Wolverine trapped underwater for an extensive period of time.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 5) #5 (Jun. 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> The second part of the story arc hints that this experience weakens his healing factor and future health.<ref>''Wolverine'' #6 & 8 (2013). Marvel Comics.</ref> Following \"Drowning Logan\", [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] reveals that an \"intelligent virus\" originating from the [[Microverse]] has shut off his healing factor, though not before it purged his body of the virus, leaving him as susceptible to injury, disease, and aging as any ordinary human.<ref name=\"Wolverinevol\">''Wolverine'' (vol. 5) #7 (July 2013). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #57 reveals that when Wolverine is injured so seriously that his body actually dies before his healing factor can repair the damage, he returns to life by fighting with Azrael, the Angel of Death, while trapped in Purgatory because Wolverine defeated Azrael in real-world combat during World War I.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #57. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, after Wolverine's resurrection and brainwashing by the Hand, he made a new deal with Azrael that repaired the damage to his soul, negated their previous arrangement, and weakened his healing factor slightly - and the next time Wolverine sustains death-inducing injuries, he will remain dead.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #61. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDue to a combination of Wolverine's healing factor and high-level [[Psionics|psionic]] shields implanted by Professor Xavier, Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to [[Telepathy|telepathic]] assault and probing.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3, #46 (Nov. 2006)</ref> Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as \"mental scar tissue\" created by the traumatic events of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''X-Men: Original Sin'' (Dec.  2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Other abilities===\nWolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,<ref>''Wolverine'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #75. Marvel Comics.</ref> The claws are not made of [[keratin]], as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #77. Marvel Comics.</ref> During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.<ref>''Wolverine'', #75. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n[[File:Wolverine Weapon X Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wolverine's claws in ''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #1 (June 2009). Art by Ron Garney.]]\nWolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify [[shapeshifting]] mutants despite other forms they may take.<ref name=\"Wolverine 1992\">''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #51 (Feb. 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, as a type of natural [[lie detector]], such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.<ref>Claremont, Chris (w), [[Davis, Alan]] [[Farmer, Mark]] (i). \"Impediments\", ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #451 (December 2004). Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #9 (Feb. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOn more than one occasion, Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, has been molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material, including most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]], which is made out of a proto-adamantium-[[vibranium]] [[alloy]]. Vibranium alone is not comparable in terms of durability with adamantium and has been broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. His claws can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #91, #101</ref> The adamantium also adds weight to his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.1 #2 October 1982\"/> His adamantium skeleton makes him highly susceptible to magnetic-based attacks.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #25 (Oct. 1993). Marvel Comics.</ref> According to [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], Wolverine would be unable to move without his enhanced strength due to the additional weight of the adamantium bonded to his skeleton.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' vol.1 #1 (Nov. 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWolverine's healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name=\"OHOTMU Wolverine\">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004''</ref> Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol.2 #1\">''Wolverine'' vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 1988.

This moved to Bowling Green in 1884 and became the '''Southern Normal School and Business College'''.{{sfn|Ellis|2011|p=137}} In 1890, '''Potter College''' was opened as a private women's college by Pleasant J.

In 1927, the school merged with Ogden College, which occupied an adjacent campus.  The name changed again in 1930 to \"'''Western Kentucky State Teachers College'''\". The school was authorized to offer the [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1931. Another name change took place in 1948, when the school became simply \"'''Western Kentucky State College'''\".\n\nWKSC merged with the '''Bowling Green College of Commerce''', which had formerly been the Bowling Green Business University, in 1963. Bowling Green Business University had originally been a part of the Southern Normal School and had been sold off by Henry Hardin Cherry when Southern Normal School was transferred to the state. The structure of the institution changed at this time, dividing into separate colleges. Bowling Green College of Commerce maintained its identity in this way. The Graduate School also became a constituent college. In 1965, three additional colleges were created. In 1966, Western Kentucky State College became '''Western Kentucky University'''.\n\nFor many years, the college was popularly known as \"Western,\" as indicated in its fight song, \"Stand Up and Cheer.\"<ref>[http://www.wkusports.com/ot/traditions.html Tradition page] at WKU athletic site</ref> However, in recent years it has indicated it prefers to be called by its initials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wky/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2012-13/misc_non_event/2013-mg.pdf|title=2012\u201313 men's basketball media guide}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2017, [[Timothy C.

The mascot has become one of the most popular characters in collegiate sports, even appearing in a series of ESPN promotions. WKU was a member of the [[Sun Belt Conference]] from 1982 to 2014. From 1948 to 1982, it was a member of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]].

In 2005, after 37 years as head coach, coach Bill Powell became an assistant coach, and holds record for being the second winningest coach in men's swimming in NCAA dual meet history.\n\nIn January 2015, former swimmer Colin Craig told police he had been assaulted and forced to drink alcohol, even though at the time he was too young to buy or drink alcohol. He also reported incidents of hazing at a house near campus. An investigation by police and school officials revealed numerous incidents of drug use and sexually charged hazing dating back to at least 2012. Powell's successor, Bruce Marchionda, was aware of this behavior and did nothing to prevent it, even though it violated university policies on hazing, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. One swimmer was charged with possession of marijuana.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bgdailynews.com/news/wku-swim-program-suspended-for-five-years-in-wake-of/article_26df8e00-e2a7-11e4-8849-1f04b5a1dc98.html|title=WKU swim program suspended for five years in wake of hazing investigation |last=Highland|first=Deborah|publisher=[[Bowling Green Daily News]]|date=April 15, 2015}}</ref>  On April 14, WKU officials announced the swimming and diving program would be suspended for five years due to what former school president Gary Ransdell called a \"pervasive\" and \"intolerable\" environment.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/c-swim/spec-rel/041415aaa.html |title=WKU Suspends Swimming and Diving Program for 5 Years |publisher=WKU Athletics |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe baseball team has enjoyed some success, winning the [[Sun Belt Conference]] tournament championship in 2009.

Diddle Arena]], home to the Men's and Women's Basketball teams at WKU]]\n\nThe men's basketball program has the 14th most victories in the history of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. The school has been to the NCAA Tournament 21 times; in addition, it has made one appearance in the NCAA [[Final Four]], in 1971 (later vacated by the NCAA). WKU also made three appearances in the NIT Final Four while it was a premier post-season tournament, equal in stature to the NCAA Tournament. In [[Street & Smith]]'s publications \"100 Greatest Programs\", WKU ranked #31. WKU also has the 3rd most conference titles in NCAA history with 41 trailing only [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] and [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], 6th in NCAA history with 40 20-win seasons, 8th in NCAA history in winning percentage at 67.2%, and recorded the first 30-win season in NCAA history in the 1937\u20131938 season with a record of 30\u20133.\n\nThe men's basketball team defeated [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders men's basketball|Middle Tennessee]] in the 2008 [[Sun Belt Conference]] tournament championship game to get a bid into the 2008 NCAA Tournament. The Hilltoppers won their first-round contest against [[2007\u201308 Drake Bulldogs men's basketball team|Drake]] on a last-second three-pointer by [[Ty Rogers]], and won their second-round game against [[San Diego Toreros men's basketball|San Diego]], before losing by 2 points against [[2007\u201308 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] in the Sweet 16. It was the Toppers' third appearance in the Sweet 16 but their first since 1993.  In 2009, the men's basketball team defeated [[2008\u201309 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to advance to the second-round game against [[2008\u201309 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]].  Unfortunately, the Toppers were beaten by a last second shot, failing to advance to their second straight Sweet 16. In the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] in 2012, the Toppers pulled off a stunning win against [[2011\u201312 Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils basketball team|Mississippi Valley State]], erasing a 16-point deficit with less than five minutes left and pulling off the 59\u201358 win while President [[Barack Obama]] and British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] looked on.\n\nThe women's basketball team is a storied program, with three [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] Final Four appearances. In 1992, coach [[Paul Sanderford]]'s Lady Toppers advanced to the national championship game before bowing out to Stanford. The Lady Toppers are known for their post-season prowess, and returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2014.\n\n[[Michelle Clark-Heard]] is the current women's basketball coach at Western Kentucky.  Coach Clark-Heard is a former WKU player who has spent the last five years as an assistant at the [[Louisville Cardinals women's basketball|University of Louisville]] under former WKU assistant coach [[Jeff Walz]]. Previously, she coached Division II [[Kentucky State University]] for two years.  In her five seasons in Louisville, the Cardinals made three regional semifinal appearances and finished as national runner-up in [[2008\u201309 Louisville Cardinals women's basketball team|2009]]. She helped develop former Louisville forward and current [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] star [[Angel McCoughtry]], and also helped recruit and develop another current WNBA player, former Cardinals guard [[Shoni Schimmel]].\n\nClark-Heard also worked as an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Cincinnati]] and [[Nebraska Cornhuskers women's basketball|Nebraska]] before her time at Kentucky State. She played four seasons for the Lady Toppers after being named the 1986 girls' high school player of the year in Kentucky.\n\nClark-Heard replaced [[Mary Taylor Cowles]], who was fired on March 8 after 10 seasons.\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|WKU Hilltoppers football}}\n\nThe Hilltopper football team belonged to what was then the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference|Gateway Football Conference]] until 2006. In 2002, WKU won the NCAA [[Division I FCS]] National Football championship. In 2006, the school's board of regents voted to move the team to the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly I-A). After two years of provisional status, they began to compete in 2009 as a member of the Sun Belt Conference. An extensive rivalry with [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky University]], known as the Battle of the Bluegrass, ended in 2008 as WKU moved into FBS football. The Hilltoppers' biggest Sun Belt rivals had been the [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders]], who are less than two hours away from WKU. The rivalry was temporarily halted in 2013 after Middle Tennessee [[2010\u201313 Sun Belt Conference realignment|left the Sun Belt]] for C-USA, but was renewed the following year when WKU moved to C-USA. The Hilltoppers are coached by head coach Tyson Helton\n\n==Student body profile==\nIn the fall semester of 2011, WKU had an enrollment of 21,048<ref name=\"wku07enroll\">https://www.wku.edu/news/releases07/september/enrollment.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907081242/https://www.wku.edu/news/releases07/september/enrollment.html|date=September 7, 2008}}</ref> students, which included 14,890<ref name=\"wku07\"/>  full-time students and 17,982<ref name=\"wku07\"/> undergraduates.

The two leading men's social organizations were [[Phi Phi Kappa]] (also known as the Thirteeners), founded in 1939; and the Barons, founded the same year. When national Greek organizations were admitted to WKU, [[Phi Phi Kappa]] became [[Delta Tau Delta]] and the Barons became [[Alpha Tau Omega]].\n\n==Media and publications==\n[[File:Adams Whitaker 2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Adams-Whitaker Student Publications Center, home to the ''College Heights Herald'', the Talisman and WKUHerald.com.]]\n\n*''[[College Heights Herald]]'', WKU's student-run newspaper since 1924\n*[[Western Kentucky Talisman|Talisman]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wku.edu/talisman/|title=WKU Talisman|website=www.wku.edu |language=en-US|access-date=March 16, 2017}}</ref> WKU's yearbook\n*[[Rise Over Run Magazine]], WKU's online magazine for independent culture\n*WKU SPIRIT, WKU's alumni magazine, published three times each year\n*[[WWHR]], Revolution 91.7 \u2013 WKU's college radio station\n*WKU NewsChannel 12 \u2013 Student-run television newscast.

Founded in 1981, its first events were workshops for [[gifted education]] professionals. It partnered with [[Duke University|Duke]]'s [[Talent Identification Program]], and began offering academic summer camps: beginning in 1983, the Summer Camp for Academically Talented Middle School Students (SCATS) for students finishing grades 6-8, and beginning in 1984 the Summer Program for Verbally and Mathematically Precocious Youth (VAMPY) for students finishing grades 7-10.

As an incoming junior, students can earn at least 60 college credit hours during their time at the school. The Gatton Academy was named \"America's Best High School\" by [[Newsweek]] in 2012<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/2012/05/20/america-s-best-high-schools.html</ref> and 2013.<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/2013/05/06/america-s-best-high-schools.html</ref> The building, originally designed in 1929, was renovated and expanded by RossTarrant Architects <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rosstarrant.com/|title=RossTarrant Architects}}</ref> to transform it into the Gatton Academy.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|WKU Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers}}\n\nThe men's athletic teams are known as the ''Hilltoppers'' and the women's teams as the ''Lady Toppers''. Their mascot is known as [[Big Red (Western Kentucky University)|Big Red]]. The mascot has become one of the most popular characters in collegiate sports, even appearing in a series of ESPN promotions. WKU was a member of the [[Sun Belt Conference]] from 1982 to 2014. From 1948 to 1982, it was a member of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]]. On July 1, 2014 all WKU athletics moved to [[Conference USA]] (C-USA).<ref name=\"wkusports1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=5400&ATCLID=207019336 |title=WKU Enters Athletic Membership Agreement with Conference USA Beginning July 1, 2014 - Western Kentucky University Official Athletics Site |publisher=Wkusports.com|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe WKU swim team, before its suspension after the 2014\u201315 season, consistently placed in the top 5 in the Mid-Major National Rankings. In 2006 their men were undefeated in dual meets and were Sun Belt Conference Champions. The women won five consecutive championships from 2001 to 2005. In 2005, after 37 years as head coach, coach Bill Powell became an assistant coach, and holds record for being the second winningest coach in men's swimming in NCAA dual meet history.\n\nIn January 2015, former swimmer Colin Craig told police he had been assaulted and forced to drink alcohol, even though at the time he was too young to buy or drink alcohol. He also reported incidents of hazing at a house near campus. An investigation by police and school officials revealed numerous incidents of drug use and sexually charged hazing dating back to at least 2012. Powell's successor, Bruce Marchionda, was aware of this behavior and did nothing to prevent it, even though it violated university policies on hazing, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. One swimmer was charged with possession of marijuana.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bgdailynews.com/news/wku-swim-program-suspended-for-five-years-in-wake-of/article_26df8e00-e2a7-11e4-8849-1f04b5a1dc98.html|title=WKU swim program suspended for five years in wake of hazing investigation |last=Highland|first=Deborah|publisher=[[Bowling Green Daily News]]|date=April 15, 2015}}</ref>  On April 14, WKU officials announced the swimming and diving program would be suspended for five years due to what former school president Gary Ransdell called a \"pervasive\" and \"intolerable\" environment.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/c-swim/spec-rel/041415aaa.html |title=WKU Suspends Swimming and Diving Program for 5 Years |publisher=WKU Athletics |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe baseball team has enjoyed some success, winning the [[Sun Belt Conference]] tournament championship in 2009.  In April 2010, the WKU baseball team defeated the [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|University of Kentucky]] 24\u20138 in a game at [[Bowling Green Ballpark]]. The crowd of 6,183 was the largest crowd to ever attend a college baseball game in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n===Basketball===\n{{Main|WKU Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Lady Toppers basketball}}\n[[File:DiddleArena.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[E.A. Diddle Arena]], home to the Men's and Women's Basketball teams at WKU]]\n\nThe men's basketball program has the 14th most victories in the history of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. The school has been to the NCAA Tournament 21 times; in addition, it has made one appearance in the NCAA [[Final Four]], in 1971 (later vacated by the NCAA). WKU also made three appearances in the NIT Final Four while it was a premier post-season tournament, equal in stature to the NCAA Tournament. In [[Street & Smith]]'s publications \"100 Greatest Programs\", WKU ranked #31. WKU also has the 3rd most conference titles in NCAA history with 41 trailing only [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] and [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], 6th in NCAA history with 40 20-win seasons, 8th in NCAA history in winning percentage at 67.2%, and recorded the first 30-win season in NCAA history in the 1937\u20131938 season with a record of 30\u20133.\n\nThe men's basketball team defeated [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders men's basketball|Middle Tennessee]] in the 2008 [[Sun Belt Conference]] tournament championship game to get a bid into the 2008 NCAA Tournament. The Hilltoppers won their first-round contest against [[2007\u201308 Drake Bulldogs men's basketball team|Drake]] on a last-second three-pointer by [[Ty Rogers]], and won their second-round game against [[San Diego Toreros men's basketball|San Diego]], before losing by 2 points against [[2007\u201308 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] in the Sweet 16. It was the Toppers' third appearance in the Sweet 16 but their first since 1993.  In 2009, the men's basketball team defeated [[2008\u201309 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to advance to the second-round game against [[2008\u201309 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]].  Unfortunately, the Toppers were beaten by a last second shot, failing to advance to their second straight Sweet 16. In the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] in 2012, the Toppers pulled off a stunning win against [[2011\u201312 Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils basketball team|Mississippi Valley State]], erasing a 16-point deficit with less than five minutes left and pulling off the 59\u201358 win while President [[Barack Obama]] and British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] looked on.\n\nThe women's basketball team is a storied program, with three [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] Final Four appearances. In 1992, coach [[Paul Sanderford]]'s Lady Toppers advanced to the national championship game before bowing out to Stanford. The Lady Toppers are known for their post-season prowess, and returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2014.\n\n[[Michelle Clark-Heard]] is the current women's basketball coach at Western Kentucky.  Coach Clark-Heard is a former WKU player who has spent the last five years as an assistant at the [[Louisville Cardinals women's basketball|University of Louisville]] under former WKU assistant coach [[Jeff Walz]]. Previously, she coached Division II [[Kentucky State University]] for two years.  In her five seasons in Louisville, the Cardinals made three regional semifinal appearances and finished as national runner-up in [[2008\u201309 Louisville Cardinals women's basketball team|2009]]. She helped develop former Louisville forward and current [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] star [[Angel McCoughtry]], and also helped recruit and develop another current WNBA player, former Cardinals guard [[Shoni Schimmel]].\n\nClark-Heard also worked as an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Cincinnati]] and [[Nebraska Cornhuskers women's basketball|Nebraska]] before her time at Kentucky State. She played four seasons for the Lady Toppers after being named the 1986 girls' high school player of the year in Kentucky.\n\nClark-Heard replaced [[Mary Taylor Cowles]], who was fired on March 8 after 10 seasons.\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|WKU Hilltoppers football}}\n\nThe Hilltopper football team belonged to what was then the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference|Gateway Football Conference]] until 2006. In 2002, WKU won the NCAA [[Division I FCS]] National Football championship. In 2006, the school's board of regents voted to move the team to the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly I-A). After two years of provisional status, they began to compete in 2009 as a member of the Sun Belt Conference. An extensive rivalry with [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky University]], known as the Battle of the Bluegrass, ended in 2008 as WKU moved into FBS football. The Hilltoppers' biggest Sun Belt rivals had been the [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders]], who are less than two hours away from WKU. The rivalry was temporarily halted in 2013 after Middle Tennessee [[2010\u201313 Sun Belt Conference realignment|left the Sun Belt]] for C-USA, but was renewed the following year when WKU moved to C-USA. The Hilltoppers are coached by head coach Tyson Helton\n\n==Student body profile==\nIn the fall semester of 2011, WKU had an enrollment of 21,048<ref name=\"wku07enroll\">https://www.wku.edu/news/releases07/september/enrollment.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907081242/https://www.wku.edu/news/releases07/september/enrollment.html|date=September 7, 2008}}</ref> students, which included 14,890<ref name=\"wku07\"/>  full-time students and 17,982<ref name=\"wku07\"/> undergraduates.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur and then go on to win the Masters as a professional. These players are [[Cary Middlecoff]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.<ref name=tickets>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/about/ticket.html |publisher=Masters.org |title=Ticket Information |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410081216/http://www.masters.org/en_US/about/ticket.html |archivedate=April 10, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe difficulty in acquiring Masters badges has made the tournament one of the largest events on the secondary-ticket market.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 43609580|last1 = Deloca|first1 = Paul J.|title = Reviewed work: The Masters: Golf Money and Power in Augusta, Georgia, Curt Sampson|journal = Journal of Sport History|volume = 27|issue = 2|pages = 333\u2013335|year = 2000}}</ref> A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

[[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

The most probable causes of this clash is  that Servetus would have started talking of his \"heretic\" theological ideas, or that Lax had silenced Servetus's probable collaboration in his work ''Quaestiones phyisicales'',  which just 11 days before had  started to get in print.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez Anc\u00edn, Miguel & Towns, Otis.

Lax kept being University of Saragossa's High master, teaching Arts,   until his death in 1560, blind and with gout in his hands.<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez Anc\u00edn, Miguel & Towns, Otis.
