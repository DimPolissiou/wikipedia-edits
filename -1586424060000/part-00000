More specifically, FES can be used to generate [[muscle]] contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI), [[head injury]], [[stroke]] and other [[neurological disorder]]s. In other words, a person would use the device each time he or she wanted to generate a desired function.<ref name=\":0\">M.R. Popovic, K. Masani and S.

In this embodiment, FES is used as a short-term therapy, the objective of which is restoration of voluntary function and not lifelong dependence on the FES device, hence the name '''functional electrical stimulation therapy''', '''FES therapy''' ('''FET''' or '''FEST'''). In other words, the FEST is used as a short-term intervention to help the central nervous system of the person to re-learn how to execute impaired functions, instead of making the person dependent on neuroprostheses for the rest of her or his life.<ref>M.K.

Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12&nbsp;Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.<ref>M.R. Popovic and T.A. Thrasher, \"Neuroprostheses\", in ''Encyclopedia of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering'', G.E. Wnek and G.L. Bowlin, Eds.: Marcel Dekker, Inc., vol. 2, pp. 1056\u20131065, 2004.</ref>\n\nFES devices take advantage of this property to electrically activate nerve cells, which then may go on to activate muscles or other nerves.<ref>Control of Movement for the Physically Disabled: Control for Rehabilitation Technology, Dejan Popovic and Thomas Sinkjaer, Springer Science & Business Media, December 6, 2012.</ref> However, special care must be taken in designing safe FES devices, as electric current through tissue can lead to adverse effects such as decrease in excitability or cell death. This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or over-excitation of the targeted neurons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and [[nerve]]s. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate [[muscle]]s, if their [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reichel M, Breyer T, Mayr W, Rattay F | year = 2002 | title = Simulation of the three-dimensional electrical field in the course of functional electrical stimulation | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 252\u2013255 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1594.2002.06945.x }}</ref> However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves\u2014descending nerves from the [[central nervous system]] to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves\u2014ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).\n\nThe electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex [[reflex]]es. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.\n\nWhen a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the [[axon]]. Typically, one \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, the other \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rushton D | year = 2003 | title = Functional electrical stimulation and rehabilitation\u2014an hypothesis | url = | journal = Med Eng Phys | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 75\u201378 | doi = 10.1016/s1350-4533(02)00040-1 }}</ref> Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.\n\nIn the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor [[withdrawal reflex]]. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor [[withdrawal reflex]] to facilitate walking in individuals following [[stroke]], or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term ''[[neuromodulation]]''.\n\nNerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the [[skin]] surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be \"activated\". They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.\n\n(This statement is correct for all commercially available stimulators except MyndMove stimulator, which has implemented a new stimulation pulse that allows the stimulator to generate muscle contractions without causing discomfort during stimulation, which is a common problem with commercially available transcutaneous electrical stimulation systems.){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn A, Keller T, Micera S, Morari  | year = 2009 | title = a simulation study | url = | journal = Medical Engineering & Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 945\u2013951 | doi=10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.006| pmid = 19540788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Micera S, Keller T, Lawrence M, Morari M, Popovi\u0107 DB| year = 2010 | title = Wearable neural prostheses.

The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as [[Cleveland FES Center]], have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.\n\nThe other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer's body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer's life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.\n\nTypical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Popovic MR, Thrasher TA, Zivanovic P, Takaki M, Hajek P | year = 2005 | title = Neuroprosthesis for Retraining Reaching and Grasping Functions in Severe Hemiplegic Patients | url = | journal = Neuromodulation | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 58\u201372 | doi = 10.1111/j.1094-7159.2005.05221.x }}</ref> or bipedal locomotion.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bajd T, Kralj A, Stefancic M, Lavrac N | year = 1999 | title = Use of functional electrical stimulation in the lower extremities of incomplete spinal cord injured patients | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 403\u2013409 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1594.1999.06360.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kapadia N, Masani K, Craven BC, Giangregorio LM, Hitzig SL, Richards K, Popovic  | year = 2014 | title = Effects on walking competency | url = | journal = The Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 511\u2013524 | doi=10.1179/2045772314y.0000000263| pmid = 25229735 | pmc = 4166186}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Bailey SN, Hardin EC, Kobetic R, Boggs LM, Pinault G, Triolo RJ | year = 2010 | title = Neurotherapeutic and neuroprosthetic effects of implanted functional electrical stimulation for ambulation after incomplete spinal cord injury | url = | journal = Journal of rehabilitation research and development | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 7\u201316 }}</ref>\n\n''Note: This paragraph was developed in part using material from.<ref name=\":0\" /> For more information on FES please consult that and other references provided in the paragraph.''\n\n==History==\nElectrical stimulation had been utilized as far back as ancient Egypt, when it was believed that placing torpedo fish in a pool of water with a human was therapeutic.

The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Triolo RJ, Bieri C, Uhlir J, Kobetic R, Scheiner A, Marsolais EB| year = 1996 | title = Implanted Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation systems for individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries: clinical case reports | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 77 | issue = 11| pages = 1119\u20131128 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(96)90133-1| pmid = 8931521 }}</ref> Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobetic R, To CS, Schnellenberger JR, Audu ML, Bulea TC, Gaudio R, Pinault G, Tashman S, Triolo RJ| year = 2009 | title = Development of hybrid orthosis for standing, walking, and stair climbing after spinal cord injury | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/19ed7a8426590f0efdadfa652fb4b99463650c64| journal = Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 447\u2013462 | doi = 10.1682/JRRD.2008.07.0087 }}</ref> These technologies have been found to be successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to wheelchair mobility.\n\n=== Stroke and upper limb recovery ===\nIn the acute stage of [[stroke]] recovery, the use of cyclic electrical stimulation has been seen to increase the isometric strength of wrist extensors.  In order to increase strength of wrist extensors, there must be a degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant [[hemiplegia]].  Patients who will elicit benefits of cyclic electrical stimulation of the wrist extensors must be highly motivated to follow through with [[therapy|treatment]], After 8 weeks of electrical stimulation, an increase in grip strength can be apparent.  Many scales, which assess the level of  [[disability]] of the upper extremities following a stroke, use grip strength as a common item.  Therefore, increasing strength of wrist extensors will decrease the level of upper extremity disability.\n\nPatients with [[hemiplegia]] following a stroke commonly experience shoulder pain and subluxation; both of which will interfere with the rehabilitation process.  Functional electrical stimulation has been found to be effective for the management of pain and reduction of shoulder subluxation, as well as accelerating the degree and rate of motor recovery.  Furthermore, the benefits of FES are maintained over time; research has demonstrated that the benefits are maintained for at least 24 months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chantraine|first=Alex|author2=Baribeault, Alain|author3= Uebelhart, Daniel|author4= Gremion, Gerald|title=Shoulder Pain and Dysfunction in Hemiplegia: Effects of Functional Electrical Stimulation|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=1999|volume=80|issue=3|pages=328\u2013331|doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90146-6|pmid=10084443}}</ref>\n\n=== Drop foot ===\n[[Foot drop|Drop foot]] is a common symptom in [[Hemiparesis|hemiplegia]], characterized by a lack of dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, resulting in short, shuffling strides. It has been shown that FES can be used to effectively compensate for the drop foot during the swing phase of the gait. At the moment just before the heel off phase of gait occurs, the stimulator delivers a stimulus to the common peroneal nerve, which results in contraction of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. There are currently a number of drop foot stimulators that use surface and implanted FES technologies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor PN, Burridge JH, Dunkerley AL, Wood DE, Norton JA, Singleton C, Swain ID| year = 1999 | title = Clinical use of the Odstock dropped foot stimulator: its effect on the speed and effort of walking | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 80 | issue = 12| pages = 1577\u20131583 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90333-7| pmid = 10597809 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Stein RB, Everaert DG, Thompson AK, Chong SL, Whittaker M, Robertson J, Kuether G | year = 2010 | title = Long-term therapeutic and orthotic effects of a foot drop stimulator on walking performance in progressive and nonprogressive neurological disorders | url = | journal = Neurorehabilitation and neural repair | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 152\u2013167 | doi = 10.1177/1545968309347681 | pmid = 19846759 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Hausdorff JM, Ring H | year = 2008 | title = Effects of a new radio frequency-controlled neuroprosthesis on gait symmetry and rhythmicity in patients with chronic hemiparesis | url = | journal = American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 4\u201313 | doi = 10.1097/phm.0b013e31815e6680 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Burridge JH, Haugland M, Larsen B, Svaneborg N, Iversen HK, Christensen PB, Pickering RM, Sinkjaer T | year = 2008 | title = Patients' perceptions of the benefits and problems of using the ActiGait implanted drop-foot stimulator | url = | journal = J Rehabil Med | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 873\u2013875 | doi = 10.2340/16501977-0268 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kenney L, Bultstra G, Buschman R, Taylor P, Mann G, Hermens H, Holsheimer J, Nene A, Tenniglo M, van der Aa H, Hobby J | year = 2002 | title = An implantable two channel drop foot stimulator: initial clinical results | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 267\u2013270 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1594.2002.06949.x }}</ref> Drop foot stimulators have been used successfully with various patient populations, such as [[stroke]], [[spinal cord injury]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].\n\nThe term \"orthotic effect\" can be used to describe the immediate improvement in function observed when the individual switches on their FES device compared to unassisted walking. This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a \"training\" or \"therapeutic effect\" is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off.  A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called \"temporary carry over effect\". Liberson et al., 1961<ref name=\"Liberson1961\" /> was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off.  It has been hypothesised that this temporary improvement in function may be linked to a long term training or therapeutic effect.

More specifically, FES can be used to generate [[muscle]] contraction in otherwise paralyzed limbs to produce functions such as grasping, walking, bladder voiding and standing. This technology was originally used to develop neuroprostheses that were implemented to permanently substitute impaired functions in individuals with [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI), [[head injury]], [[stroke]] and other [[neurological disorder]]s. In other words, a person would use the device each time he or she wanted to generate a desired function.<ref name=\":0\">M.R. Popovic, K. Masani and S.

Nerve signals are frequency modulated; i.e. the number of action potentials that occur in a unit of time is proportional to the intensity of the transmitted signal. Typical action potential frequency is between 4 and 12&nbsp;Hz. An electrical stimulation can artificially elicit this action potential by changing the electric potential across a nerve cell membrane (this also includes the nerve axon) by inducing electrical charge in the immediate vicinity of the outer membrane of the cell.<ref>M.R.

This may be due to thermal damage, electroporation of the cell membrane, toxic products from electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface, or over-excitation of the targeted neurons or muscles. Typically FES is concerned with stimulation of neurons and [[nerve]]s. In some applications, FES can be used to directly stimulate [[muscle]]s, if their [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] have been severed or damaged (i.e., denervated muscles).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reichel M, Breyer T, Mayr W, Rattay F | year = 2002 | title = Simulation of the three-dimensional electrical field in the course of functional electrical stimulation | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 252\u2013255 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1594.2002.06945.x }}</ref> However, the majority of the FES systems used today stimulate the nerves or the points where the junction occurs between the nerve and the muscle. The stimulated nerve bundle includes motor nerves (efferent nerves\u2014descending nerves from the [[central nervous system]] to muscles) and sensory nerves (afferent nerves\u2014ascending nerves from sensory organs to the central nervous system).\n\nThe electrical charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation is aimed at generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex [[reflex]]es. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or more muscles in response to the sensory nerve stimulation.\n\nWhen a nerve is stimulated, i.e., when sufficient electrical charge is provided to a nerve cell, a localized depolarization of the cell wall occurs resulting in an action potential that propagates toward both ends of the [[axon]]. Typically, one \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate along the axon towards the muscle (orthodromic propagation) and concurrently, the other \"wave\" of action potentials will propagate towards the cell body in the central nervous system (antidromic propagation). While the direction of propagation in case of the antidromic stimulation and the sensory nerve stimulation is the same, i.e., towards the central nervous system, their end effects are very different. The antidromic stimulus has been considered an irrelevant side effect of FES. However, in recent years a hypothesis has been presented suggesting the potential role of the antidromic stimulation in neurorehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rushton D | year = 2003 | title = Functional electrical stimulation and rehabilitation\u2014an hypothesis | url = | journal = Med Eng Phys | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 75\u201378 | doi = 10.1016/s1350-4533(02)00040-1 }}</ref> Typically, FES is concerned with orthodromic stimulation and uses it to generate coordinated muscle contractions.\n\nIn the case where sensory nerves are stimulated, the reflex arcs are triggered by the stimulation on sensory nerve axons at specific peripheral sites. One example of such a reflex is the flexor [[withdrawal reflex]]. The flexor withdrawal reflex occurs naturally when a sudden, painful sensation is applied to the sole of the foot. It results in flexion of the hip, knee and ankle of the affected leg, and extension of the contralateral leg in order to get the foot away from the painful stimulus as quickly as possible. The sensory nerve stimulation can be used to generate desired motor tasks, such as evoking flexor [[withdrawal reflex]] to facilitate walking in individuals following [[stroke]], or they can be used to alter reflexes or the function of the central nervous system. In the later case, the electrical stimulation is commonly described by the term ''[[neuromodulation]]''.\n\nNerves can be stimulated using either surface (transcutaneous) or subcutaneous (percutaneous or implanted) electrodes. The surface electrodes are placed on the [[skin]] surface above the nerve or muscle that needs to be \"activated\". They are noninvasive, easy to apply, and generally inexpensive. Until recently the common belief in the FES field has been that due to the electrode-skin contact impedance, skin and tissue impedance, and current dispersion during stimulation, much higher-intensity pulses are required to stimulate nerves using surface stimulation electrodes as compared to the subcutaneous electrodes.\n\n(This statement is correct for all commercially available stimulators except MyndMove stimulator, which has implemented a new stimulation pulse that allows the stimulator to generate muscle contractions without causing discomfort during stimulation, which is a common problem with commercially available transcutaneous electrical stimulation systems.){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA major limitation of the transcutaneous electrical stimulation is that some nerves, for example those innervating the hip flexors, are too profound to be stimulated using surface electrodes. This limitation can be partly addressed by using arrays of electrodes, which can use several electrical contacts to increase selectivity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn A, Keller T, Micera S, Morari  | year = 2009 | title = a simulation study | url = | journal = Medical Engineering & Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 8| pages = 945\u2013951 | doi=10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.006| pmid = 19540788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Micera S, Keller T, Lawrence M, Morari M, Popovi\u0107 DB| year = 2010 | title = Wearable neural prostheses.

The percutaneous electrodes consist of thin wires inserted through the skin and into muscular tissue close to the targeted nerve. These electrodes typically remain in place for a short period of time and are only considered for short-term FES interventions. However, it is worth mentioning that some groups, such as [[Cleveland FES Center]], have been able to safely use percutaneous electrodes with individual patients for months and years at a time. One of the drawbacks of using the percutaneous electrodes is that they are prone to infection and special care has to be taken to prevent such events.\n\nThe other class of subcutaneous electrodes is implanted electrodes. These are permanently implanted in the consumer's body and remain in the body for the remainder of the consumer's life. Compared to surface stimulation electrodes, implanted and percutaneous electrodes potentially have higher stimulation selectivity, which is a desired characteristics of FES systems. To achieve higher selectivity while applying lower stimulation amplitudes, it is recommended that both cathode and anode are in the vicinity of the nerve that is stimulated. The drawbacks of the implanted electrodes are they require an invasive surgical procedure to install, and, as is the case with every surgical intervention, there exists a possibility of infection following implantation.\n\nTypical stimulation protocols used in clinical FES involves trains of electric pulses. Biphasic, charged balanced pulses are employed as they improve the safety of electrical stimulation and minimize some of the adverse effects. Pulse duration, pulse amplitude and pulse frequency are the key parameters that are regulated by the FES devices. The FES devices can be current or voltage regulated. Current regulated FES systems always deliver the same charge to the tissue regardless of the skin/tissue resistance. Because of that, the current regulated FES systems do not require frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity. The voltage regulated devices may require more frequent adjustments of the stimulation intensity as the charge that they deliver changes as the skin/tissue resistance changes. The properties of the stimulation pulse trains and how many channels are used during stimulation define how complex and sophisticated FES-induced function is. The system can be as simple such as FES systems for muscle strengthening or they can be complex such as FES systems used to deliver simultaneous reaching and grasping,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Popovic MR, Thrasher TA, Zivanovic P, Takaki M, Hajek P | year = 2005 | title = Neuroprosthesis for Retraining Reaching and Grasping Functions in Severe Hemiplegic Patients | url = | journal = Neuromodulation | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 58\u201372 | doi = 10.1111/j.1094-7159.2005.05221.x }}</ref> or bipedal locomotion.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bajd T, Kralj A, Stefancic M, Lavrac N | year = 1999 | title = Use of functional electrical stimulation in the lower extremities of incomplete spinal cord injured patients | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 403\u2013409 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1594.1999.06360.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kapadia N, Masani K, Craven BC, Giangregorio LM, Hitzig SL, Richards K, Popovic  | year = 2014 | title = Effects on walking competency | url = | journal = The Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 511\u2013524 | doi=10.1179/2045772314y.0000000263| pmid = 25229735 | pmc = 4166186}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Bailey SN, Hardin EC, Kobetic R, Boggs LM, Pinault G, Triolo RJ | year = 2010 | title = Neurotherapeutic and neuroprosthetic effects of implanted functional electrical stimulation for ambulation after incomplete spinal cord injury | url = | journal = Journal of rehabilitation research and development | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 7\u201316 }}</ref>\n\n''Note: This paragraph was developed in part using material from.<ref name=\":0\" /> For more information on FES please consult that and other references provided in the paragraph.''\n\n==History==\nElectrical stimulation had been utilized as far back as ancient Egypt, when it was believed that placing torpedo fish in a pool of water with a human was therapeutic.

At the moment just before the heel off phase of gait occurs, the stimulator delivers a stimulus to the common peroneal nerve, which results in contraction of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion. There are currently a number of drop foot stimulators that use surface and implanted FES technologies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor PN, Burridge JH, Dunkerley AL, Wood DE, Norton JA, Singleton C, Swain ID| year = 1999 | title = Clinical use of the Odstock dropped foot stimulator: its effect on the speed and effort of walking | url = | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 80 | issue = 12| pages = 1577\u20131583 | doi=10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90333-7| pmid = 10597809 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Stein RB, Everaert DG, Thompson AK, Chong SL, Whittaker M, Robertson J, Kuether G | year = 2010 | title = Long-term therapeutic and orthotic effects of a foot drop stimulator on walking performance in progressive and nonprogressive neurological disorders | url = | journal = Neurorehabilitation and neural repair | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 152\u2013167 | doi = 10.1177/1545968309347681 | pmid = 19846759 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Hausdorff JM, Ring H | year = 2008 | title = Effects of a new radio frequency-controlled neuroprosthesis on gait symmetry and rhythmicity in patients with chronic hemiparesis | url = | journal = American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation / Association of Academic Physiatrists | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 4\u201313 | doi = 10.1097/phm.0b013e31815e6680 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Burridge JH, Haugland M, Larsen B, Svaneborg N, Iversen HK, Christensen PB, Pickering RM, Sinkjaer T | year = 2008 | title = Patients' perceptions of the benefits and problems of using the ActiGait implanted drop-foot stimulator | url = | journal = J Rehabil Med | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 873\u2013875 | doi = 10.2340/16501977-0268 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kenney L, Bultstra G, Buschman R, Taylor P, Mann G, Hermens H, Holsheimer J, Nene A, Tenniglo M, van der Aa H, Hobby J | year = 2002 | title = An implantable two channel drop foot stimulator: initial clinical results | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 267\u2013270 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1594.2002.06949.x }}</ref> Drop foot stimulators have been used successfully with various patient populations, such as [[stroke]], [[spinal cord injury]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].\n\nThe term \"orthotic effect\" can be used to describe the immediate improvement in function observed when the individual switches on their FES device compared to unassisted walking. This improvement disappears as soon as the person switches off their FES device. In contrast, a \"training\" or \"therapeutic effect\" is used to describe a long term improvement or restoration of function following a period of using the device which is still present even when the device is switched off.  A further complication to measuring an orthotic effect and any long term training or therapeutic effects is the presence of a so-called \"temporary carry over effect\". Liberson et al., 1961<ref name=\"Liberson1961\" /> was the first to observe that some stroke patients appeared to benefit from a temporary improvement in function and were able to dorsiflex their foot for up to an hour after the electrical stimulation had been turned off.  It has been hypothesised that this temporary improvement in function may be linked to a long term training or therapeutic effect.

The]]\n\n=== Stroke ===\nHemiparetic stroke patients, who are impacted by the denervation, muscular atrophy, and spasticity, typically experience an abnormal gait pattern due to muscular weakness and the incapacity to voluntary contract certain ankle and hip muscles at the appropriate walking phase. Liberson et al., (1961) were the first to pioneer FES in stroke patients.<ref name=\"Liberson1961\" />  More recently, there have been a number of studies that have been conducted in this area. A systematic review conducted in 2012 on the use of FES in chronic stroke included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 231 participants.  The review found a small treatment effect for using FES for the 6 minute walking test.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=Shelialah|last2=Mehta|first2=Swati|last3=McIntyre|first3=Amanda|last4=Lobo|first4=Liane|last5=Teasell|first5=Robert W.|date=2012-12-01|title=Functional electrical stimulation for improving gait in persons with chronic stroke|journal=Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation|volume=19|issue=6|pages=491\u2013498|doi=10.1310/tsr1906-491|issn=1074-9357|pmid=23192714}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple sclerosis ===\nFES has also been found to be useful for treating foot drop in people with [[multiple sclerosis]].
