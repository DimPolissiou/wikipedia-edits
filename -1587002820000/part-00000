Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Home range]]s tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges {{convert|1.4|\u2013|18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size for females, while those of males measured {{convert|8.5|\u2013|25.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area.<ref name=Hunter/> Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of {{convert|88|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi}}, while the home range of a female in the same region measured {{convert|13|\u2013|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.<ref name=Nowak/> Population densities are typically low, around {{convert|0.01|to|0.05|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}, though the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as {{convert|0.2|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bellani/>\n\nMarking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

[[Estrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother does not leave her young for long, and starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Home range]]s tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges {{convert|1.4|\u2013|18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size for females, while those of males measured {{convert|8.5|\u2013|25.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area.<ref name=Hunter/> Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of {{convert|88|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi}}, while the home range of a female in the same region measured {{convert|13|\u2013|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.<ref name=Nowak/> Population densities are typically low, around {{convert|0.01|to|0.05|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}, though the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as {{convert|0.2|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bellani/>\n\nMarking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered. Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp. In captivity, females in [[estrus]] have been observed making faint sounds as they [[scent mark]] the area around their enclosures.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/> \n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi typically feed on small-sized prey weighing less than {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet. Vegetation such as grasses have also been recorded in their diet.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/><ref name=ms/> A study showed jaguarundis take {{convert|400|g|oz|abbr=on}} vertebrate prey on an average everyday.<ref name=ms/> The broad array of prey recorded for the jaguarundi across its range and varying proportions of different prey in its diet could indicate that the cat tends to feed on the most abundant and easily catchable prey in the area.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nJaguarundis have been observed mating all year round, with peaks at different times of the year across the range; for instance, in Mexico breeding peaks in January and March. [[Estrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother does not leave her young for long, and starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become [[sexually mature]] at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi.jpg|thumb|Captive jaguarundi]]\nThe jaguarundi has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2002. The megareserves of the [[Amazon Basin]] are probably the only conservation units that can sustain long-term viable populations.<ref name=iucn/>\nIt is not particularly sought after for its [[fur]], but is suffering decline due to loss of habitat.

''Vandegrift'' reached the area on 5 April, and at about 0800 the following morning, she lowered a team in a [[rigid hull inflatable boat]] (RHIB), and the sailors brought the family and the pararescuemen on board the frigate.

It was originally set for release on 6 March, however, it had to be delayed due to problems with the album shipment. On 6 March, their new single \"Ain\u2019t Got You\" was released. On 13 March, they made a surprise drop with their new song \u2018Invisible\u2019. On 27 March 2020, their album was finally released. In late March, they had to postpone their ''Sadboi'' tour due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak.]] Some concerts were cancelled and others were postponed.\n\n==Members==\n===Leondre Devries (Bars)===\nLeondre Antonio Devries was born on 6 October  2000<ref name=\"Billboard\" /> to stonemason Antonio and personal trainer Victoria Lee.<ref name=\"WO open up\" /><ref name=\"SWEP video\">{{cite video|author=G Roberts|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Leondre Devries from Bars and Melody tells all |publisher=South Wales Evening Post |date=7 June 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017|time=0:34}}</ref> From [[Port Talbot]], [[Neath Port Talbot]], Wales, he has three older brothers\u2014Jacob Lee, Joseph Devries (Joey), the eldest is Ben Lee \u2014and a younger sister, Matilda Devries (Tilly).<ref name=\"WO open up\" /> Joey was part of the boy band [[Overload Generation]] who participated in the [[The X Factor (UK series 11)|eleventh series]] of ''The X Factor''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/x-factor-overload-generation-second-7920625?pageNumber=17 |title=X Factor: Overload Generation is second Welsh act to make it through to live stages of talent show | author=Sandra Loy |date=11 October 2014 |website=Wales Online |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> Leondre Devries has spoken openly about his experiences of bullying for four years before he switched schools.<ref name=\"WO open up\" /> He attended the Glan Afan Comprehensive School at the time of the ''Britain's Got Talent'' competition.<ref name=\"SWEP Leondre\">{{cite news|author=G Roberts|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Leondre from Bars and Melody tells all |newspaper=South Wales Evening Post |date=7 June 2014|accessdate=15 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193439/http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Previously he rapped solo under the stage name 'Little Dre'.<ref name=\"WO open up\">{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/britains-talent-2014-bars-melody-7184915 |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Bars and Melody open up on their meteoric rise to fame|date=29 May 2014|work=Wales Online|accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref> His father said that Leondre lived with him until he appeared on ''Britain's Got Talent'', and after that has lived with his mother.<ref name=\"YN\">{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/britains-got-talent-stars-bars-and-melody-being-115755985.html |title=Britain\u2019s Got Talent Stars Bars And Melody Being Sued By Member\u2019s Own DAD | author=Adele Ankers |date=25 March 2016 |website=Yahoo News |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> Although Leondre said that his father was a stonemason during the contest,<ref name=\"SWEP video\" /> his father now says he is a music promoter.<ref name=\"YN\" />\n\n===Charlie Lenehan (Melody)===\nCharlie Lenehan was born 27 October 1998 in [[Frampton Cotterell]].<ref name=\"Billboard\" /> He lives in [[Cologne, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/barsandmelody/status/1083478258119860224?lang=en-gb |title=Twitter |publisher=Mobile.twitter.com |date=2019-01-10 |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref> He has a family that consists of his mother, a school cook; his step-father, a businessman;<ref>{{cite video|author=G Roberts|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Leondre Devries from Bars and Melody tells all |publisher=South Wales Evening Post |date=7 June 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017|time=0:42}}</ref> he has a younger sister, Brooke.

Although accessibility on all [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|buses]] is provided in compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), much of the MTA's rail system, including its [[rapid transit]] ([[New York City Subway]] and [[Staten Island Railway]]) and [[commuter rail]] services ([[Long Island Rail Road]] [LIRR] and [[Metro-North Railroad]]), were built before [[wheelchair]] access was a requirement under the ADA. As a side effect, many stations were not designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nA state law, the [[New York Human Rights Law]], prevents discrimination on the basis of disability. Since 1990, [[elevator]]s have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA, with most grade-level stations requiring little modification to meet ADA standards. In addition, the MTA identified 100 \"key stations\", high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.mta.info/accessibility/index.html | title = MTA Guide to Accessible Transit | publisher = New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority | accessdate = March 8, 2010 }}</ref>{{efn|name=key-stations}} One of the key tenets of the Fast Forward Plan to rescue the subway system released in 2018 is to drastically increase the number of ADA-accessible subway stations, adding accessible facilities to 70 stations by 2024.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Church Av toilets vc.jpg|thumb|Accessible restroom at [[Church Avenue station (IND Culver Line)|Church Avenue station]] on the [[IND Culver Line]]]]\n[[File:Bayside LIRR Station; Bottom of PW-bound Ramp.jpg|thumb|Rear of the accessible ramp along the eastbound platform of the [[Bayside station (LIRR)|Bayside Long Island Rail Road station]]]]\n[[File:Irvington Metro-North-032.jpg|thumb|Accessible ramp leading to the northbound platform at the [[Irvington station (Metro-North)|Irvington Metro-North station]]]]\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has been gradually adding [[Disability rights movement|disabled access]] to its key stations since the 1980s, as renovations take place. According to the MTA:\n\n:In improving services to individuals with disabilities, the MTA identified stations and facilities where compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would benefit the most people, analyzing such factors as high ridership, transfer points, and service to major areas of activity. These stations were given priority in our station-renovation program.

[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) is incomplete. Although accessibility on all [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|buses]] is provided in compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), much of the MTA's rail system, including its [[rapid transit]] ([[New York City Subway]] and [[Staten Island Railway]]) and [[commuter rail]] services ([[Long Island Rail Road]] [LIRR] and [[Metro-North Railroad]]), were built before [[wheelchair]] access was a requirement under the ADA. As a side effect, many stations were not designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nA state law, the [[New York Human Rights Law]], prevents discrimination on the basis of disability. Since 1990, [[elevator]]s have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA, with most grade-level stations requiring little modification to meet ADA standards. In addition, the MTA identified 100 \"key stations\", high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.mta.info/accessibility/index.html | title = MTA Guide to Accessible Transit | publisher = New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority | accessdate = March 8, 2010 }}</ref>{{efn|name=key-stations}} One of the key tenets of the Fast Forward Plan to rescue the subway system released in 2018 is to drastically increase the number of ADA-accessible subway stations, adding accessible facilities to 70 stations by 2024.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Church Av toilets vc.jpg|thumb|Accessible restroom at [[Church Avenue station (IND Culver Line)|Church Avenue station]] on the [[IND Culver Line]]]]\n[[File:Bayside LIRR Station; Bottom of PW-bound Ramp.jpg|thumb|Rear of the accessible ramp along the eastbound platform of the [[Bayside station (LIRR)|Bayside Long Island Rail Road station]]]]\n[[File:Irvington Metro-North-032.jpg|thumb|Accessible ramp leading to the northbound platform at the [[Irvington station (Metro-North)|Irvington Metro-North station]]]]\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has been gradually adding [[Disability rights movement|disabled access]] to its key stations since the 1980s, as renovations take place. According to the MTA:\n\n:In improving services to individuals with disabilities, the MTA identified stations and facilities where compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) would benefit the most people, analyzing such factors as high ridership, transfer points, and service to major areas of activity. These stations were given priority in our station-renovation program.
