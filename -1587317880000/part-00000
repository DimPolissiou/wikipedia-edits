Sarasota County is part of the North Port-Sarasota-[[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], FL [[Sarasota metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Sarasota, Florida}}\n[[Image:Onetower.JPG|thumb|Downtown Sarasota, the county seat, from the [[John Ringling Causeway]]]]\n\nSarasota County was created in 1921. After acquisition by the United States as a territory and once Florida obtained state status, the area now included in the county had been governed by [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], then [[Manatee County]] as the state was divided into smaller and smaller governmental organizations. Manatee County was carved up to allow the creation of three more counties as well.\n\nAlthough the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts the origin of the name, Sarasota, is unknown. Some believe a fanciful story created for a popular early twentieth-century pageant held in Sarasota, that it was named after the daughter of famous explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s daughter Sara.\n\nAccording to the [http://www.floridaleagueofcities.com/ Florida League of Cities], the name first appeared in print as \"Zarazote\" on a 1763 land grant map.\n\n'''Joseph Daniel Anderson''' was one of the pioneers of the Sarasota area. He established his homestead in the Forked Creek area in 1886 and became an early leader in what now is southern Sarasota County (having been Manatee County from 1855 until 1921).\n\nThe following is a transcript from a Sarasota County historical marker that was erected in a park dedicated to Anderson on [[Manasota Key]].\n\n:''\"After the Civil War, many Georgians moved their families to Southern Florida. Joseph Daniel \"Jody\" Anderson, born in Georgia in 1867, was a child when his father moved to the Tampa/Sara Sota area. In 1884, Joseph became the head of the Anderson family. Two years later, he moved his family to Southern Manatee County. He homesteaded the land in the Mystic River (Forked Creek) Valley. In 1890 he married Helen Alice Johnson of Sarasota. They had eleven children. Eight survived.''\n\n:''With only hand tools, Anderson converted the Florida wilderness into an agricultural industry. This fertile land produced vegetables, sugar cane and citrus. In the vast Myakka/Pinedale area, he raised his cattle and swine. He and brother Moses \"Lee\" prospered in ranching until the Range Law Act curtailed the right to use this land for grazing.''\n\n:''Sleds (later wagons) were used to move the farm produce, fruit and cattle to Lemon Bay where they were transferred to draft boats and transported to ships at Boca Grande. Some of the wagons were rafted across the bay to Manasota Beach where the produce was ferried to Cuban [[Smack (ship)|smacks]] and later to American schooners.''\n\n:''Anderson pioneered commercial fishing in North Lemon Bay which teemed with schools of mullet and other fish. The Andersons fished with nets made of cotton and flax twine over which they poured a heavy lime solution to prevent rot. Their base of operation included land storage facilities on the shore and on the beach (Manasota) to salt, dry and pack the fish in barrels. Upon the arrival of run boats with ice from Tampa, the Andersons could ship fresh fish and produce.''\n\n:''Joseph Daniel \"Jody\" Anderson was a quiet family man who never sought publicity. However, before Sarasota County was organized, he served as deputy sheriff and game warden in the Pinedale/Manasota area. The Anderson family built the area's first school (Pinedale) of which Jody was trustee. He also organized the first church in the area. Anderson actively supported the creation of Sarasota County from Manatee County and in 1922, became the first elected county commissioner from District 4. After the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ethel Morgan with whom he raised four more children. Joseph Daniel Anderson died in 1939.\"''\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Great Egret - Myakka River State Park.jpg|thumb|A [[great egret]] in [[Myakka River State Park]]]]\n[[Image:Black-necked Stilt - Myakka River State Park.jpg|thumb|[[Black-necked stilt]] in Myakka River State Park]]\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|725|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|556|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|169|sqmi}} (23.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]] - north\n* [[DeSoto County, Florida|DeSoto County]] - east\n* [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]] - south\n\n===Parks and preserves===\nIn addition to local parks there are several preserve areas including:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bayonne Parcel]]\n* [[Circus Hammock]]\n* [[Curry Creek Preserve]]\n* [[Deer Prairie Creek]]\n* [[Jelks Preserve]]\n* [[Lemon Bay Preserve]]\n* [[Manasota Scrub Preserve]]\n* [[Myakka Islands Point]]\n* [[Old Miakka Preserve]]\n* [[Pinelands Reserve]]\n* [[Pocono Trail Preserve]]\n* [[Red Bug Slough]]\n* [[Sleeping Turtles South]]\n* [[Sleeping Turtles North]]\n* [[South Lemon Bay Preserve]]\n* [[T.

After acquisition by the United States as a territory and once Florida obtained state status, the area now included in the county had been governed by [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]], then [[Manatee County]] as the state was divided into smaller and smaller governmental organizations. Manatee County was carved up to allow the creation of three more counties as well.\n\nAlthough the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts the origin of the name, Sarasota, is unknown. Some believe a fanciful story created for a popular early twentieth-century pageant held in Sarasota, that it was named after the daughter of famous explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s daughter Sara.\n\nAccording to the [http://www.floridaleagueofcities.com/ Florida League of Cities], the name first appeared in print as \"Zarazote\" on a 1763 land grant map.\n\n'''Joseph Daniel Anderson''' was one of the pioneers of the Sarasota area. He established his homestead in the Forked Creek area in 1886 and became an early leader in what now is southern Sarasota County (having been Manatee County from 1855 until 1921).\n\nThe following is a transcript from a Sarasota County historical marker that was erected in a park dedicated to Anderson on [[Manasota Key]].\n\n:''\"After the Civil War, many Georgians moved their families to Southern Florida. Joseph Daniel \"Jody\" Anderson, born in Georgia in 1867, was a child when his father moved to the Tampa/Sara Sota area. In 1884, Joseph became the head of the Anderson family. Two years later, he moved his family to Southern Manatee County. He homesteaded the land in the Mystic River (Forked Creek) Valley. In 1890 he married Helen Alice Johnson of Sarasota. They had eleven children. Eight survived.''\n\n:''With only hand tools, Anderson converted the Florida wilderness into an agricultural industry. This fertile land produced vegetables, sugar cane and citrus. In the vast Myakka/Pinedale area, he raised his cattle and swine. He and brother Moses \"Lee\" prospered in ranching until the Range Law Act curtailed the right to use this land for grazing.''\n\n:''Sleds (later wagons) were used to move the farm produce, fruit and cattle to Lemon Bay where they were transferred to draft boats and transported to ships at Boca Grande. Some of the wagons were rafted across the bay to Manasota Beach where the produce was ferried to Cuban [[Smack (ship)|smacks]] and later to American schooners.''\n\n:''Anderson pioneered commercial fishing in North Lemon Bay which teemed with schools of mullet and other fish. The Andersons fished with nets made of cotton and flax twine over which they poured a heavy lime solution to prevent rot. Their base of operation included land storage facilities on the shore and on the beach (Manasota) to salt, dry and pack the fish in barrels. Upon the arrival of run boats with ice from Tampa, the Andersons could ship fresh fish and produce.''\n\n:''Joseph Daniel \"Jody\" Anderson was a quiet family man who never sought publicity. However, before Sarasota County was organized, he served as deputy sheriff and game warden in the Pinedale/Manasota area. The Anderson family built the area's first school (Pinedale) of which Jody was trustee. He also organized the first church in the area. Anderson actively supported the creation of Sarasota County from Manatee County and in 1922, became the first elected county commissioner from District 4. After the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ethel Morgan with whom he raised four more children. Joseph Daniel Anderson died in 1939.\"''\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Great Egret - Myakka River State Park.jpg|thumb|A [[great egret]] in [[Myakka River State Park]]]]\n[[Image:Black-necked Stilt - Myakka River State Park.jpg|thumb|[[Black-necked stilt]] in Myakka River State Park]]\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|725|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|556|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|169|sqmi}} (23.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]] - north\n* [[DeSoto County, Florida|DeSoto County]] - east\n* [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]] - south\n\n===Parks and preserves===\nIn addition to local parks there are several preserve areas including:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bayonne Parcel]]\n* [[Circus Hammock]]\n* [[Curry Creek Preserve]]\n* [[Deer Prairie Creek]]\n* [[Jelks Preserve]]\n* [[Lemon Bay Preserve]]\n* [[Manasota Scrub Preserve]]\n* [[Myakka Islands Point]]\n* [[Old Miakka Preserve]]\n* [[Pinelands Reserve]]\n* [[Pocono Trail Preserve]]\n* [[Red Bug Slough]]\n* [[Sleeping Turtles South]]\n* [[Sleeping Turtles North]]\n* [[South Lemon Bay Preserve]]\n* [[T.

It is situated 30&nbsp;km from Hassan, 181&nbsp;km from [[Mangalore]] and 195&nbsp;km from [[Bangalore]]. The river Hemavati forms the entire northern boundary of the Taluk; river [[Kaveri]] runs through a portion of the south. It is well connected by road to many towns and cities of Karnataka. [[Holenarasipura]] is the nearest railway station to Arakalgud taluk and the nearest\nairport is in [[Mangalore]].\n\n==History==\nIt is said that Gautama rishi performed penance to [[Surya]](Sun God) and installed the idol of Arkeshwara, the presiding deity of the local Arkeshwara temple and the town was originally called Arkapuri (city of an image of Arkeshwara, the presiding deity). Hence the name Arkalgud came into existence. It was founded by Krishnappa Nayaka, one of the Aigur (Balam) chiefs in 1568 A.D. It was then captured by [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I]] of [[Mysore]] in 1647 A.D., it was retaken subsequently by Keladi Shivappa Nayaka of Ikkeri and finally in 1694 by [[Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar]] (1673\u20131704) of Mysore.\n\n==Geography and salient features==\nArkalgud is located at {{Coord|12.77|N|76.06|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Arkalgud.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Arkalgud]</ref> It has an average elevation of {{convert|918|m|abbr=on}}.\nIt lies partly in semi-malnad and partly in maidan tract.  The total geographical area of the Taluk is 675&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It occupies sixth place in the District in terms of  geographical area. The soil is red sandy derived from granites, gneiss and schists.  The soil is red to brownish in colour, shallow to fairly deep shallow, loamy to sandy loamy in texture intermixed with fairly large amounts of coarse gravel and pebbles. They are well drained but poor in bases and water holding capacity. It is favourable for growing crops like paddy, sugarcane, coconut, potato, vegetables and plantation crops under irrigated conditions. It is suitable for growing ragi, millets, pulses, groundnut,  potato and maize under rain-fed conditions.  The river [[Kaveri]] enters at Kodavinahosahalli, a village in the south of Arkalgud and flows only through a small portion of about 24&nbsp;km and enters [[Mysore]] district.  An Anicut called [[Krishnarajakatte]] has been constructed across the river in the Taluk from which two channels viz. [[Kattepura]] channel and [[Ramanathapura]] channel take off for a length of about 24&nbsp;km and 30&nbsp;km respectively. The [[Kattepura]] channel runs along the south bank, past Rudrapatna; and the Ramanathapura Channel along the north bank past [[Konnanur]] and [[Ramanathapura]] to Basavapatna. The river Hemavati divides Arakalgud and Hassan taluks.  The river enters in Honnathapura in the western side and flows towards to east and enters [[Holenarasipura]] taluk. The  taluk receives rainfall from south-west monsoon.  It is located at around {{convert|3085|ft}} above sea level.  This taluk enjoys dry and cold climate during the year as the central part of the Taluk borders the [[Malenadu]] region and south-eastern portions form the southern maidan region. One can find some low hilly regions in the taluk as well as high altitude region such as Hippi-betta (3486&nbsp;ft. or 1063 meters) in the western portion of the taluk. Basavapatna is one of the villages of arakalgud taluk and Lakshmikanthaswamy temple is situated.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|work= |publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Arkalgud had a population of 15,184.

Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government.<ref name=\"maineenvironment.org\"/> Federal lands include two national parks\u2014[[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]\u2014two national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.\n\nOriginal inhabitants of the region include the [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Arapaho]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and [[Shoshone]]. Southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the [[Spanish Empire]] and then Mexican territory until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. The region acquired the name ''Wyoming'' when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 1865 to provide a \"temporary government for [[Wyoming Territory|the territory of Wyoming]]\". The name was used earlier for the [[Wyoming Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and is derived from the [[Munsee language|Munsee]] word ''{{lang|umu|xw\u00e9:wam\u0259nk}}'', meaning \"at the big river flat\".<ref name=\"Bright, William 2004 pg. 576\">Bright, William (2004).

Agricultural commodities include [[livestock]] (beef), [[hay]], [[sugar beet]]s, grain ([[wheat]] and [[barley]]), and [[wool]]. The climate is [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] and [[continental climate|continental]], drier and windier than the rest of the U.S., with greater temperature extremes.\n\nWyoming has been a politically conservative state since the 1950s, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate winning every presidential election except that of [[United States presidential election in Wyoming, 1964|1964]].<ref name=leip>{{cite web |title = Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |accessdate = November 18, 2016 |url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180709214827/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |archive-date = July 9, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\n\n{{Further|Climate change in Wyoming}}\n[[File:Wyoming K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]]]\n[[File:Wyoming.JPG|thumb|On [[Interstate 80]], leaving [[Utah]]]]\n[[File:Autumn in the Bighorn Mountains.JPG|thumb|Autumn in the Bighorn Mountains]]\n\nWyoming's climate is generally [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] and [[continental climate|continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold steppe|''BSk'']]''), and is drier and windier in comparison to most of the United States with greater temperature extremes. Much of this is due to the topography of the state. Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between {{convert|85|and|95|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in most of the state. With increasing elevation, however, this average drops rapidly with locations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} averaging around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Summer nights throughout the state are characterized by a rapid cooldown with even the hottest locations averaging in the {{convert|50|\u2013|60|F|C}} range at night. In most of the state, most of the precipitation tends to fall in the late spring and early summer. Winters are cold, but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods, with [[Chinook winds]] providing unusually warm temperatures in some locations. Wyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rainfall per year. Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the [[Bighorn Basin|Big Horn Basin]] averaging {{convert|5|-|8|in|mm}} (making the area nearly a true [[desert]]). The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around {{convert|10|-|12|in|mm}}, making the climate there [[semi-arid]]. Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation, {{convert|20|in|mm}} or more, much of it as snow, sometimes {{convert|200|in|cm}} or more annually. The state's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} at [[Basin, Wyoming|Basin]] on July 12, 1900 and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-66|F|C}} at [[Riverside, Wyoming|Riverside]] on February 9, 1933.\n\nThe number of [[thunderstorm]] days vary across the state with the southeastern plains of the state having the most days of thunderstorm activity. Thunderstorm activity in the state is highest during the late spring and early summer. The southeastern corner of the state is the most vulnerable part of the state to [[tornado]] activity. Moving away from that point and westwards, the incidence of tornadoes drops dramatically with the west part of the state showing little vulnerability. Tornadoes, where they occur, tend to be small and brief, unlike some of those that occur farther east.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"width:700px;\"\n! colspan= \"14\" style=\"background: #6688AA; color: #6688AA\" | <span style=\"margin-left: 80px; color: white\">{{big|[[Casper, Wyoming|<span style=\"color:white;\">Casper</span>]] climate:}} Average maximum and minimum temperatures, and average rainfall.</span>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

In the northwest are the [[Absaroka Range|Absaroka]], [[Owl Creek Mountains|Owl Creek]], [[Gros Ventre Range|Gros Ventre]], [[Wind River Range|Wind River]], and the [[Teton Range|Teton]] ranges. In the north central are the [[Big Horn Mountains]]; in the northeast, the [[Black Hills]]; and in the southern region the [[Laramie Mountains|Laramie]], [[Medicine Bow Mountains|Snowy]], and [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre]] ranges.\n\nThe Snowy Range in the south central part of the state is an extension of the Colorado [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] both in geology and in appearance. The Wind River Range in the west central part of the state is remote and includes more than 40 mountain peaks in excess of {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in addition to Gannett Peak, the highest peak in the state. The Big Horn Mountains in the north central portion are somewhat isolated from the bulk of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Teton Range in the northwest extends for {{convert|50|mi|km}}, part of which is included in [[Grand Teton National Park]]. The park includes the [[Grand Teton]], the second highest peak in the state.\n\nThe [[Continental Divide]] spans north-south across the central portion of the state. Rivers east of the divide drain into the [[Missouri River Basin]] and eventually the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. They are the [[North Platte River|North Platte]], [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind]], [[Bighorn River|Big Horn]] and the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] rivers. The [[Snake River]] in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the [[Columbia River]] and the Pacific Ocean, as does the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] through the [[Colorado River]] Basin.\n\nThe Continental Divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the [[Great Divide Basin]] where water that precipitates onto or flows into it cannot reach an ocean\u2014it ''all'' sinks into the soil and eventually evaporates.\n\nSeveral rivers begin in or flow through the state, including the Yellowstone River, Bighorn River, Green River, and the Snake River.\n\n====Islands====\n\n{{Main list|List of islands of Wyoming}}\n\nWyoming has 32 named islands; the majority are in [[Jackson Lake]] and [[Yellowstone Lake]], within [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the northwest portion of the state.

The [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Arapaho]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and [[Shoshone]] were but a few of the original inhabitants white explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and later Mexican territory of [[Alta California]], until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. French-Canadian trappers from Qu\u00e9bec and Montr\u00e9al went into the state in the late 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as T\u00e9ton and [[Jacques La Ramee|La Ramie]]. [[John Colter]], a member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], itself guided by French Canadian [[Toussaint Charbonneau]] and his young Shoshone wife, [[Sacagawea]], first described the region in 1807. At the time, his reports of the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Yellowstone]] area were considered to be fictional.<ref>{{Gutenberg |no=42112 |name=The Yellowstone National Park |bullet=none }}</ref> [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]] and a party of five men returning from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] discovered [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1812. The [[Oregon Trail]] later followed that route. In 1850, [[Jim Bridger]] located what is now known as [[Bridger Pass]], which the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] used in 1868\u2014as did [[Interstate 80 in Wyoming|Interstate 80]], 90 years later. Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that, like those of Colter, were largely regarded as [[tall tale]]s at the time.\n\nThe region acquired the name ''Wyoming'' by 1865, when Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]] of [[Ohio]] introduced a bill to Congress to provide a \"temporary government for [[Wyoming Territory|the territory of Wyoming]]\". The territory was named after the [[Wyoming Valley]] in Pennsylvania, made famous by the 1809 poem ''[[Gertrude of Wyoming]]'' by [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], based on the [[Battle of Wyoming]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The name ultimately derives from the [[Munsee language|Munsee]] word ''{{lang|umu|xw\u00e9:wam\u0259nk}}'', meaning \"at the big river flat\".<ref name=\"Bright, William 2004 pg. 576\"/><ref name=\"State of Wyoming\u2014Narrative\"/>\n[[File:Wyoming Jeep Trail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|A backcountry road in the [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre Range]] of southeastern Wyoming, near Bridger Peak]]\n\nThe region's population grew steadily after the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] reached the town of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] in 1867, and the federal government established the Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868.<ref>[http://wyoming.gov/state/wyoming_news/general/history.asp State of Wyoming\u2014General Facts About Wyoming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200649/http://wyoming.gov/state/wyoming_news/general/history.asp |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> Unlike mineral-rich [[Colorado]], Wyoming lacked significant deposits of gold and silver, as well as Colorado's subsequent population boom.

This led to the creation of [[Yellowstone National Park]], which became the world's first [[national park]] in 1872. Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming.\n\nOn December 10, 1869, territorial Governor [[John Allen Campbell]] extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and then United States state to grant [[suffrage]] to women. In addition, Wyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into politics. Women first served on juries in Wyoming ([[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] in 1870); Wyoming had the first female court bailiff ([[Mary Atkinson (bailiff)|Mary Atkinson]], Laramie, in 1870); and the first female [[justice of the peace]] in the country ([[Esther Hobart Morris]], South Pass City, in 1870).

Wyoming does not have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Wyoming|lieutenant governor]]. Instead the secretary of state stands first in the line of succession.\n\nWyoming's sparse population warrants it only a single [[at-large]] seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], and hence only three votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].\n\nWyoming is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].\n\n===Judicial system===\n\nWyoming's highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Wyoming]], with five justices presiding over appeals from the state's lower courts. Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate [[appellate court]], like most states. This is largely attributable to the state's population and correspondingly lower caseload. Appeals from the state district courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Wyoming also has state circuit courts (formerly county courts), of limited jurisdiction, which handle certain types of cases, such as civil claims with lower dollar amounts, misdemeanor criminal offenses, and [[felony]] [[arraignment]]s. Circuit court judges also commonly hear small claims cases as well.\n\nBefore 1972, Wyoming judges were selected by popular vote on a nonpartisan ballot. This earlier system was criticized by the state bar who called for the adoption of the [[Missouri Plan]], a system designed to balance judiciary independence with judiciary accountability. In 1972, an amendment to Article{{nbsp}}5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which incorporated a modified version of the plan, was adopted by the voters. Since the adoption of the amendment, all state court judges in Wyoming are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the Governor. They are then subject to a [[retention vote]] by the electorate one year after appointment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubble |first1=Larry |title=The Equality State: Government and Politics in Wyoming |date=2008 |publisher=Eddie Bowers Publishing Co. |location=Peosta, Iowa |isbn=978-1-57879-076-0 |pages=91\u201392 |edition=6th|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Political history===\n\n{{further|Political party strength in Wyoming}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:2em\"\n|-\n!\n!

Today, Wyoming is represented in Washington by its two Senators, [[Mike Enzi]] and [[John Barrasso]], and its one member of the House of Representatives, Congresswoman [[Liz Cheney]]. All three are Republicans; a Democrat has not represented Wyoming in the Senate since 1977 or in the House since 1978. The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, one of only eight times since statehood. At present, there is only one relatively reliably Democratic county, affluent [[Teton County, Wyoming|Teton]], and one swing county, college county [[Albany County, Wyoming|Albany]]. In the 2004 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] won his second-largest victory, with 69% of the vote. Former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] is a Wyoming resident and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.\n\nRepublicans are no less dominant at the state level. They have held a majority in the state senate continuously since 1936 and in the state house since 1964. However, Democrats held the [[governor of Wyoming|governorship]] for all but eight years between 1975 and 2011. Uniquely, Wyoming elected Democrat [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] as the first woman in United States history to serve as state governor. She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, [[William Bradford Ross]], unexpectedly died a little more than a year into his term.<ref>{{cite book |author=Teva J.

Counties have the option of collecting an additional 1% tax for general revenue and a 1% tax for specific purposes, if approved by voters. Food for human consumption is not subject to sales tax.<ref>[http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2006/03/03/news/wyoming/32-food-tax.prt ''Votes back repeal of food tax''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414230521/https://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2006/03/03/news/wyoming/32-food-tax.prt |date=April 14, 2006 }}, [[Billings Gazette]], March 3, 2006</ref> There also is a county lodging tax that varies from 2% to 5%. The state collects a [[use tax]] of 5% on items purchased elsewhere and brought into Wyoming.\nAll [[property tax]] is based on the assessed value of the property and Wyoming's Department of Revenue's Ad Valorem Tax Division supports, trains, and guides local government agencies in the uniform assessment, valuation and taxation of locally assessed property. \"Assessed value\" means taxable value; \"taxable value\" means a percent of the fair market value of property in a particular class. Statutes limit property tax increases. For county revenue, the property tax rate cannot exceed 12 [[Mill (currency)|mills]] (or 1.2%) of assessed value. For cities and towns, the rate is limited to eight [[Mill (currency)|mills]] (0.8%). With very few exceptions, state law limits the property tax rate for all governmental purposes.\n\n[[Personal property]] held for personal use is tax-exempt. Inventory if held for resale, pollution control equipment, cash, accounts receivable, stocks and bonds are also exempt. Other exemptions include property used for religious, educational, charitable, fraternal, benevolent and government purposes and improvements for handicapped access. Mine lands, underground mining equipment, and oil and gas extraction equipment are exempt from property tax but companies must pay a gross products tax on minerals and a [[severance tax]] on mineral production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvpolicy.org/getting-the-story-right-mineral-taxation-in-wyoming-and-west-virginia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117043021/http://www.wvpolicy.org/getting-the-story-right-mineral-taxation-in-wyoming-and-west-virginia |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |title=Getting the Story Right; Mineral Taxation in Wyoming and West Virginia |publisher=West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy Blog |accessdate=November 10, 2012 }}</ref><ref>Wyoming Statutes Section 39-13-103</ref>\n\nWyoming does not collect [[inheritance tax]]es.

Much of this is due to the topography of the state. Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between {{convert|85|and|95|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in most of the state. With increasing elevation, however, this average drops rapidly with locations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} averaging around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Summer nights throughout the state are characterized by a rapid cooldown with even the hottest locations averaging in the {{convert|50|\u2013|60|F|C}} range at night. In most of the state, most of the precipitation tends to fall in the late spring and early summer. Winters are cold, but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods, with [[Chinook winds]] providing unusually warm temperatures in some locations. Wyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rainfall per year. Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the [[Bighorn Basin|Big Horn Basin]] averaging {{convert|5|-|8|in|mm}} (making the area nearly a true [[desert]]). The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around {{convert|10|-|12|in|mm}}, making the climate there [[semi-arid]]. Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation, {{convert|20|in|mm}} or more, much of it as snow, sometimes {{convert|200|in|cm}} or more annually. The state's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} at [[Basin, Wyoming|Basin]] on July 12, 1900 and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-66|F|C}} at [[Riverside, Wyoming|Riverside]] on February 9, 1933.\n\nThe number of [[thunderstorm]] days vary across the state with the southeastern plains of the state having the most days of thunderstorm activity. Thunderstorm activity in the state is highest during the late spring and early summer. The southeastern corner of the state is the most vulnerable part of the state to [[tornado]] activity. Moving away from that point and westwards, the incidence of tornadoes drops dramatically with the west part of the state showing little vulnerability. Tornadoes, where they occur, tend to be small and brief, unlike some of those that occur farther east.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"width:700px;\"\n! colspan= \"14\" style=\"background: #6688AA; color: #6688AA\" | <span style=\"margin-left: 80px; color: white\">{{big|[[Casper, Wyoming|<span style=\"color:white;\">Casper</span>]] climate:}} Average maximum and minimum temperatures, and average rainfall.</span>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The state is a great [[plateau]] broken by many [[mountain range]]s. Surface elevations range from the summit of [[Gannett Peak]] in the [[Wind River Range|Wind River Mountain Range]], at {{convert|13804|ft|m}}, to the [[Belle Fourche River]] valley in the state's northeast corner, at {{convert|3125|ft|m}}. In the northwest are the [[Absaroka Range|Absaroka]], [[Owl Creek Mountains|Owl Creek]], [[Gros Ventre Range|Gros Ventre]], [[Wind River Range|Wind River]], and the [[Teton Range|Teton]] ranges. In the north central are the [[Big Horn Mountains]]; in the northeast, the [[Black Hills]]; and in the southern region the [[Laramie Mountains|Laramie]], [[Medicine Bow Mountains|Snowy]], and [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre]] ranges.\n\nThe Snowy Range in the south central part of the state is an extension of the Colorado [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] both in geology and in appearance. The Wind River Range in the west central part of the state is remote and includes more than 40 mountain peaks in excess of {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in addition to Gannett Peak, the highest peak in the state. The Big Horn Mountains in the north central portion are somewhat isolated from the bulk of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Teton Range in the northwest extends for {{convert|50|mi|km}}, part of which is included in [[Grand Teton National Park]]. The park includes the [[Grand Teton]], the second highest peak in the state.\n\nThe [[Continental Divide]] spans north-south across the central portion of the state. Rivers east of the divide drain into the [[Missouri River Basin]] and eventually the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. They are the [[North Platte River|North Platte]], [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind]], [[Bighorn River|Big Horn]] and the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] rivers. The [[Snake River]] in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the [[Columbia River]] and the Pacific Ocean, as does the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] through the [[Colorado River]] Basin.\n\nThe Continental Divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the [[Great Divide Basin]] where water that precipitates onto or flows into it cannot reach an ocean\u2014it ''all'' sinks into the soil and eventually evaporates.\n\nSeveral rivers begin in or flow through the state, including the Yellowstone River, Bighorn River, Green River, and the Snake River.\n\n====Islands====\n\n{{Main list|List of islands of Wyoming}}\n\nWyoming has 32 named islands; the majority are in [[Jackson Lake]] and [[Yellowstone Lake]], within [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the northwest portion of the state.

The [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Arapaho]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and [[Shoshone]] were but a few of the original inhabitants white explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and later Mexican territory of [[Alta California]], until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. French-Canadian trappers from Qu\u00e9bec and Montr\u00e9al went into the state in the late 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as T\u00e9ton and [[Jacques La Ramee|La Ramie]]. [[John Colter]], a member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], itself guided by French Canadian [[Toussaint Charbonneau]] and his young Shoshone wife, [[Sacagawea]], first described the region in 1807. At the time, his reports of the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Yellowstone]] area were considered to be fictional.<ref>{{Gutenberg |no=42112 |name=The Yellowstone National Park |bullet=none }}</ref> [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]] and a party of five men returning from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] discovered [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1812. The [[Oregon Trail]] later followed that route. In 1850, [[Jim Bridger]] located what is now known as [[Bridger Pass]], which the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] used in 1868\u2014as did [[Interstate 80 in Wyoming|Interstate 80]], 90 years later. Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that, like those of Colter, were largely regarded as [[tall tale]]s at the time.\n\nThe region acquired the name ''Wyoming'' by 1865, when Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]] of [[Ohio]] introduced a bill to Congress to provide a \"temporary government for [[Wyoming Territory|the territory of Wyoming]]\". The territory was named after the [[Wyoming Valley]] in Pennsylvania, made famous by the 1809 poem ''[[Gertrude of Wyoming]]'' by [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], based on the [[Battle of Wyoming]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The name ultimately derives from the [[Munsee language|Munsee]] word ''{{lang|umu|xw\u00e9:wam\u0259nk}}'', meaning \"at the big river flat\".<ref name=\"Bright, William 2004 pg. 576\"/><ref name=\"State of Wyoming\u2014Narrative\"/>\n[[File:Wyoming Jeep Trail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|A backcountry road in the [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre Range]] of southeastern Wyoming, near Bridger Peak]]\n\nThe region's population grew steadily after the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] reached the town of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] in 1867, and the federal government established the Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868.<ref>[http://wyoming.gov/state/wyoming_news/general/history.asp State of Wyoming\u2014General Facts About Wyoming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200649/http://wyoming.gov/state/wyoming_news/general/history.asp |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> Unlike mineral-rich [[Colorado]], Wyoming lacked significant deposits of gold and silver, as well as Colorado's subsequent population boom.

This led to the creation of [[Yellowstone National Park]], which became the world's first [[national park]] in 1872. Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming.\n\nOn December 10, 1869, territorial Governor [[John Allen Campbell]] extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and then United States state to grant [[suffrage]] to women. In addition, Wyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into politics. Women first served on juries in Wyoming ([[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] in 1870); Wyoming had the first female court bailiff ([[Mary Atkinson (bailiff)|Mary Atkinson]], Laramie, in 1870); and the first female [[justice of the peace]] in the country ([[Esther Hobart Morris]], South Pass City, in 1870). Also, in 1924, Wyoming became the first state to elect a female governor, [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], who took office in January 1925.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=T.

Wyoming does not have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Wyoming|lieutenant governor]]. Instead the secretary of state stands first in the line of succession.\n\nWyoming's sparse population warrants it only a single [[at-large]] seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], and hence only three votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].\n\nWyoming is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]].\n\n===Judicial system===\n\nWyoming's highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Wyoming]], with five justices presiding over appeals from the state's lower courts. Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate [[appellate court]], like most states. This is largely attributable to the state's population and correspondingly lower caseload. Appeals from the state district courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Wyoming also has state circuit courts (formerly county courts), of limited jurisdiction, which handle certain types of cases, such as civil claims with lower dollar amounts, misdemeanor criminal offenses, and [[felony]] [[arraignment]]s. Circuit court judges also commonly hear small claims cases as well.\n\nBefore 1972, Wyoming judges were selected by popular vote on a nonpartisan ballot. This earlier system was criticized by the state bar who called for the adoption of the [[Missouri Plan]], a system designed to balance judiciary independence with judiciary accountability. In 1972, an amendment to Article{{nbsp}}5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which incorporated a modified version of the plan, was adopted by the voters. Since the adoption of the amendment, all state court judges in Wyoming are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the Governor. They are then subject to a [[retention vote]] by the electorate one year after appointment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubble |first1=Larry |title=The Equality State: Government and Politics in Wyoming |date=2008 |publisher=Eddie Bowers Publishing Co. |location=Peosta, Iowa |isbn=978-1-57879-076-0 |pages=91\u201392 |edition=6th|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Political history===\n\n{{further|Political party strength in Wyoming}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:2em\"\n|-\n!\n!

Today, Wyoming is represented in Washington by its two Senators, [[Mike Enzi]] and [[John Barrasso]], and its one member of the House of Representatives, Congresswoman [[Liz Cheney]]. All three are Republicans; a Democrat has not represented Wyoming in the Senate since 1977 or in the House since 1978. The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, one of only eight times since statehood. At present, there is only one relatively reliably Democratic county, affluent [[Teton County, Wyoming|Teton]], and one swing county, college county [[Albany County, Wyoming|Albany]]. In the 2004 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] won his second-largest victory, with 69% of the vote. Former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] is a Wyoming resident and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.\n\nRepublicans are no less dominant at the state level. They have held a majority in the state senate continuously since 1936 and in the state house since 1964. However, Democrats held the [[governor of Wyoming|governorship]] for all but eight years between 1975 and 2011. Uniquely, Wyoming elected Democrat [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] as the first woman in United States history to serve as state governor. She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, [[William Bradford Ross]], unexpectedly died a little more than a year into his term.<ref>{{cite book |author=Teva J.

Statutes limit property tax increases. For county revenue, the property tax rate cannot exceed 12 [[Mill (currency)|mills]] (or 1.2%) of assessed value. For cities and towns, the rate is limited to eight [[Mill (currency)|mills]] (0.8%).

Inventory if held for resale, pollution control equipment, cash, accounts receivable, stocks and bonds are also exempt. Other exemptions include property used for religious, educational, charitable, fraternal, benevolent and government purposes and improvements for handicapped access.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A.

The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

Meanwhile, he repeatedly and rather forcefully favors its analyses over Sen's.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1985|pp= 18, 53, 57 |quote=In my opinion the Famine Commission wrote an excellent report. They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses. They entered into their study with no preconceived ideas as to whether it was a FAD or a distribution famine and they reached a conclusion that was not in accordance with the official view (p. 18). }} British accusations that Indian officials were responsible began as early as 1943, as an editorial in ''The Statesman'' on 5&nbsp;October noted disapprovingly.{{sfn |\u00d3&nbsp;Gr\u00e1da |2015 |p=57}}\n\nPaul Greenough stands somewhat apart from other analysts by emphasising a pattern of victimization. In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S.

The \"test\" aspect arose because there was an assumption that if relatively large numbers of people took the offer, that indicated that famine conditions were prevalent.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015 |p=29 }}  Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=553}} Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices,{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=545}} but in practice gave little help to the rural poor, instead placing them into direct purchasing competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=559}} Thus from the beginning of the crisis until around August 1943, private charity was the principal form of relief available to the very poor.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|p=38}}\n\nAccording to Paul Greenough, the Provincial Government of Bengal delayed its relief efforts primarily because they had no idea how to deal with a provincial rice market crippled by the interaction of man-made shocks,{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |pp=127\u2013128|ps=&nbsp;\"Finally, and perhaps most compellingly, responsible officials in the Revenue and Civil Supplies ministries simply did not know how to proceed with relief under the bizarre conditions that had developed by mid\u20131943\".}} as opposed to the far more familiar case of localised shortage due to natural disaster. Moreover, the urban middle-class were their overriding concern, not the rural poor. They were also expecting the Government of India to rescue Bengal by bringing food in from outside the province (350,000 tons had been promised but not delivered). And finally, they had long stood by a public propaganda campaign declaring \"sufficiency\" in Bengal's rice supply, and were afraid that speaking of scarcity rather than sufficiency would lead to increased [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] and speculation.{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |p=127}}\n\nThere was also rampant corruption and nepotism in the distribution of government aid; often as much as half of the goods disappeared into the black market or into the hands of friends or relatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Brennan|1y=1988|1pp=555, 557 |2a1=Greenough |2y=1982 |2p=169|3a1= J.

Nevertheless, food distributed from government gruel kitchens immediately became the main source of aid for the rural poor.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nThe rails had been repaired in August and pressure from the Government of India brought substantial supplies into Calcutta during September,{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=136}} Linlithgow's final month as Viceroy. However, a second problem emerged: the Civil Supplies Department of Bengal was undermanned and under-equipped to distribute the supplies, and the resulting transportation bottleneck left very large piles of grain accumulating in the open air in several locations, including Calcutta's Botanical Garden.{{sfnm|1a1=Famine Inquiry Commission |1y=1945a |1pp=61\u201362|ps=, as cited in {{harvnb|Schneer|1947|p=176}} |2a1=Greenough |2y=1980|2p=214}} [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Archibald Wavell replaced Linlithgow that October, within two weeks he had requested military support for the transport and distribution of crucial supplies.

A key source of impoverishment was the widespread coping strategy of selling assets, including land.  In 1943 alone in one village in east Bengal, for example,  54 out of a total of 168 families sold all or part of their landholdings; among these, 39 (or very nearly 3 out of 4) did so as a coping strategy in reaction to the scarcity of food.{{sfn| \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2009|p=172}} As the famine wore on across Bengal, nearly 1.6 million families&nbsp;\u2013 roughly one-quarter of all landholders&nbsp;\u2013 sold or mortgaged their paddy lands in whole or in part. Some did so to profit from skyrocketing prices, but many others were trying to save themselves from crisis-driven distress.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The novel ''Ashani Sanket'' by [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]] is a fictional account of a young doctor and his wife in rural Bengal during the famine. It was adapted into a film of the same name (''[[Distant Thunder (1973 film)|Distant Thunder]]'') by director [[Satyajit Ray]] in 1973. The film is listed in ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made''.{{sfn|Best movies|2003}} Also well-known are the novel ''So Many Hungers!'' (1947) by [[Bhabani Bhattacharya]] and the 1980 film ''[[Akaler Shandhaney]]'' by [[Mrinal Sen]]. [[Ella Sen]]'s collection of stories based on reality, ''Darkening Days: Being a Narrative of Famine-Stricken Bengal'' recounts horrific events from a woman's point of view.{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=37}}\n\nA contemporary sketchbook of iconic scenes of famine victims, ''Hungry Bengal: a tour through Midnapur District in November, 1943'' by [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya|Chittaprosad]], was immediately banned by the British and 5,000 copies were seized and destroyed.{{sfn|J.

Attempting to determine culpability, research and analysis has covered complex issues such as the impacts of natural forces, market failures, failed policies or even malfeasance by governmental institutions, and war profiteering or other unscrupulous acts by private business. The questionable accuracy of much of the available contemporary statistical and anecdotal data is a complicating factor,{{sfn|Tauger |2009 |pp=173\u2013174}} as is the fact that the analyses and their conclusions are political and politicised.{{sfnm|1a1=Tauger |1y=2009 |1p=175 |2a1=Siegel|2y=2018|2p=43| 3a1=Devereux |3y=2000|3p=23 |4a1=Devereux|4y=2003|4p=256}}\n\nThe degree of crop shortfall in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has dominated the [[historiography]] of the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015 |p=12}}{{efn-ua|See for example {{harvtxt|A.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1977}} but the death blow was devastating leaps in the inflation rate due to heavy speculative buying and panic-driven hoarding.{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1976|1p= 1280|2a1=A. Sen |2y=1977|2p= 50 |3a1= A. Sen|3y=1981a|3p=76}} This in turn caused a fatal decline in the [[real wage]]s of landless agricultural workers,{{sfn|Aykroyd|1975|p=74}} transforming what should have been a local shortage into a horrific famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nMore recent analyses often stress political factors.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=21\u201323|ps=&nbsp;\"The conclusion is inescapable: famines are ''always'' political.\"}} Discussions of the government's role split into two broad camps: those which suggest that the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis,{{sfn|Brennan|Heathcote|Lucas|1984|p=18}} and those which assert that the government wilfully caused or ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and \"panicky responses\"{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2002b|p=102}} from a government that was spectacularly inept,{{sfnm|1a1=A.

He is smiling and making a \"V for victory\" gesture.|thumb |upright=0.9 |British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1943]]\n\nSen, for example, does not deny that British mis-government contributed to the crisis, but sees the policy failure as a complete misunderstanding of the cause of the famine. This misunderstanding led to a wholly misguided emphasis on measuring non-existent food shortages rather than addressing the very real and devastating inflation-driven imbalances in exchange entitlements.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|pp=52\u201353}} In stark contrast, though Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da notes that the exchange entitlements view of this famine is generally accepted,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=90|quote=The 1943\u201344 famine has become paradigmatic as an 'entitlements famine,' whereby speculation born of greed and panic produced an 'artificial' shortage of rice, the staple food.}} he lends greater weight to the importance of a crop shortfall than does Sen, and goes on to largely reject Sen's emphasis on hoarding and speculation.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1y=2008|1pp=25\u201328|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2015|2p=90}} He does not stop there, however, but emphasises a \"lack of political will\" and the pressure of wartime priorities that drove the British government and the provincial government of Bengal to make fateful decisions: the \"denial policies\", the use of heavy shipping for war supplies rather than food, the refusal to officially declare a state of famine, and the [[Balkanization|Balkanisation]] of grain markets through inter-provincial trade barriers.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |1y=2015|1p=90|1ps=&nbsp;\"...the lack of political will to divert foodstuffs from the war effort rather than [market] speculation... was mainly responsible for the famine\"|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008|2pp=20, 33}} On this view, these policies were designed to serve British military goals at the expense of Indian interests,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|pp=190\u2013191}} reflecting the War Cabinet's willingness to \"supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wavell|1y=1973|1pp= 68, 122|2a1=S.

Mukherjee |2015|pp=251\u2013252}} The policies may have met their intended wartime goals, but only at the cost of large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.
