He formed his own band, Emperor, in the 1980s with five members: Zaw Myo Htut (his brother and lead guitarist), Kyin Kham Phone (bass), Wai Tun (drums), Maung Maung Lwin (keyboards), John O'Hara (acoustics). He was strictly a country and rock and roll singer in his early career. His first album,\"Mercury Night\" released in 1983, was not a success. He produced three more solo albums, \"New Road\", \"Comet\", and \"Power of Love\" but they were not much of success either. In 1989, his greatest hits album \"The Bests of Zaw Win Htut\" was a huge success and  made him a rock star.\n\n===Wearing someone else's clothes===\nLike most Burmese pop singers, Zaw Win Htut became famous with [[Burmese language]] [[cover song|covers]] of foreign (mostly Western rock and pop) hits, written by successful cover \"songwriters\" such as [[Thukhamein Hlaing]], [[Min Chit Thu]], [[Win Min Htwe]], and [[Saw Khu Sae]]. Unlike most Burmese pop stars, this grandson of Shwe Taing Nyunt was actually embarrassed about it. He famously said that singing those songs were like wearing someone else's shirt. In a 2004 interview he said that his goal was to make original music.<ref name=\"pm\"/>\n\nHe decided to make only \"original\" (i.e. non-cover) albums in mid 1990s. He was one of the first artists in the Burmese pop music industry to break away from the cover song mold so many Burmese artists follow. He did score a few hits with ''A-Hnaing-Me'' and ''Achit Mya Thu Si Mha''. He continues to perform his famous cover hits in concerts although he performs only the original songs in his overseas concerts. In a 2010 interview, he admitted that he refused to do any concerts overseas for many years because he did not have a sufficient number of original songs, and that he began doing overseas concerts only after he had collected enough original songs. In the same interview he said he had done over 20 overseas concerts.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/timeout/541/timeout01.html|title=Singers play away|author=Moh Moh Thaw|date=20 September 2010|work=The Myanmar Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, he introduced the [[blues]] to his records.\n\n===Politics===\n\"Though their profession calls for them to strut onstage like rebels, Burma's rockers can only mime the anti-establishment part.
