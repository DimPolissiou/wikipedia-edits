In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally payment [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/> By 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the north and Bank (now Guardswell) to the south.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/> A 2017 survey found the ruins of nine buildings.<ref name=tayl/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch \u2013 the latter made from reeds from the banks of the Tay. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Also, Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\n[[File:Pitmiddle_c._1900.jpg|thumb|right|Pitmiddle around 1900, looking north to Pitmiddle Hill]]\n\n[[File:Pitmiddle_sawmill.jpg|thumb|right|Employees of Pitmiddle's sawmill in March 1915]]\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what there had been six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref> On an [[Ordnance Survey]] map of 1861, a \"mill dam\" is shown southeast of the settlement, towards today's Guardswell Farm.<ref>[https://i0.wp.com/holeousia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pitmiddle-village-1861.jpg?ssl=1 Ordnance Survey map, 1861]</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

The story follows Reuben Feffer ([[Ben Stiller]]), a tightly-wound New Yorker who finds his life falling apart when he discovers his wife cheating on him with a scuba diver on their honeymoon. He then rebounds and finds himself falling in love with his former classmate Polly Prince ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) as she tries to loosen up his rigid ways, which brings him to question his life and some decisions, and that you can't analyze the safe choice in love all the time.\n\n==Plot==\nReuben Feffer ([[Ben Stiller]]), a risk analyst for [[life insurance]], is celebrating his [[honeymoon]] with newlywed wife, Lisa Kramer ([[Debra Messing]]), on the island of [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|St. Barts]], but catches her having sex with Claude ([[Hank Azaria]]), a [[French people|French]] scuba instructor. Returning home to New York alone, he attempts to piece his life back together. Reuben goes to an art gallery with his friend, Sandy Lyle ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]), where he runs into former [[Middle school|junior high school]] classmate Polly Prince ([[Jennifer Aniston]]).\n\nReuben and Polly begin dating, with her introducing him to activities he once wrote off as \"too risky\". This included eating at a [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] restaurant which ends badly due to Reuben's IBS ([[Irritable bowel syndrome]]). Luckily, Polly gives him a second chance where they end up [[salsa dancing]] and later enthusiastically having sex together, with Reuben shouting \"50\" as he ejaculates. The contrast between their two personalities is a source of comedy throughout the film until Lisa returns and tells him she wants to reconcile their relationship. Meanwhile, Sandy, a self-centered, former [[teen idol]], is trying to make a comeback by having a documentary filmed about his starring role as Judas in an amateur production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.\n\nReuben is torn between the free-spirited Polly and the safe and familiar Lisa. To solve this issue, he enters information about Polly and Lisa into a computer insurance program which measures risk. The computer tells him that, despite his numerous blunders with her, Polly is the least risky choice for Reuben. Polly joins Reuben on a [[sailing]] trip where he is to inspect Leland Van Lew ([[Bryan Brown]]), a high-risk client, but she is offended when she sees his risk analysis of her. She rejects his proposal to move in together, telling him that he would be better off going back to Lisa.\n\nBack home, Reuben tries talking to Polly, but to no avail. He eventually invites Lisa to Sandy's opening show, where he learns that Polly is leaving New York in a few hours. After a speech given by his father, Irving ([[Bob Dishy]]), to Sandy about not living in the past, Reuben realizes he wants to be with Polly and not Lisa, and he rushes to her apartment to stop her from leaving. Polly is not convinced she should stay with him, so Reuben eats food off the ground to prove he is capable of taking risks.\n\nReuben and Polly [[vacation]] on the same beach where he and Lisa had their honeymoon. Reuben again encounters Claude, but instead of being angry, he thanks Claude before heading into the water with Polly to join Van Lew on his new boat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Reuben Feffer\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Polly Prince\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Lisa Kramer\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Sandford \"Sandy\" Lyle\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Stanley \"Stan\" Indursky\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Claude\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Roxanne\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Leland Van Lew\n* [[Jsu Garcia]] as Javier\n* [[Michele Lee]] as Vivian Feffer\n* [[Bob Dishy]] as Irving Feffer\n* [[Masi Oka]] as Wonsuk\n* [[Judah Friedlander]] as Dustin\n* [[Kym Whitley]] as Gladys \n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Vic\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at #1 at the U.S. [[Box office]], earning [[US$]]27,721,185 in its opening weekend, ending the month-long reign of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title='Along Came Polly' ...

One is that the [[Chordate]] phylum split in four before ''Metaspriggina'' lived, with ''Metaspriggina'' and the other craniates (both gnathostomatans and [[Agnatha]]) grouped with ''Branchiostoma'' and the cephalochordates, and ''Pikaia'' out on a side branch. ''Metaspriggina'' is here a direct ancestor of all gnathostomatans, with the Agnatha the most closely related group. In this explanation, ''Pikaia'' is not a close relative of [[Craniate]]<nowiki/>s at all, nor of cephalochordates, but something even more primitive, and the defining feature of the craniate-cephalochordate group is their gill bars.\n\nThe other explanation is that ''Metaspriggina'' was the ancestor of all gnathostomatans, again closely related to the Agnatha to form the Chordata. However, instead of being a very primitive relative, ''Pikaia'' was the ancestor of all cephalochordates, and the gill bars evolved convergently in them somewhere between ''Pikaia'' and ''Branchiostoma.'' This might explain why ''Branchiostoma'' has such a different number of gill bars to chordates (or at least their embryos).<ref name=\":0\" />\nConsidering that conondonts, the teeth elements of a type of extinct fish belonging to the Agnatha, are allready found in Cambrium stage 2 (521-529 MA BP), some 20 million years before the Burgess shale, this latter explanation does not stand. The split between Agnatha and and other chordates must therefore have happened earlier, during Cambrium stage 1 or even Ediacaran times, profiding plenty of time for a split between Agnatha and the gnathostomatans. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Burgess Shale species | 81}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-fossil-find-pinpoints-the-origin-of-jaws-in-vertebrates |title=New fossil find pinpoints the origin of jaws in vertebrates |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 11, 2014 |website=Research at Cambridge: News |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |location=Cambridge, England |accessdate=2014-06-13}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q140492}}\n\n[[Category:Cambrian chordates]]\n[[Category:Burgess Shale fossils]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric jawless fish genera]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| fossil_range = {{Fossil range|Burgess Shale}}\n| image = Metaspriggina_and_Maripolia.png\n| image_caption = An artist's concept of '''''Metaspriggina''''' based on Conway Morris, Caron.<ref name=\"ConwayMorrisCaron2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Conway Morris |first1=Simon |authorlink1=Simon Conway Morris |last2=Caron |first2=Jean-Bernard |date=June 11, 2014 |title=A primitive fish from the Cambrian of North America |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |location=London |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |doi=10.1038/nature13414 |issn=0028-0836 |volume=512 |issue=7515 |pages=419\u2013422 |pmid=24919146}}</ref>\n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Chordate|Chordata]]\n| familia = [[Metaspriggiidae]]\n| genus = '''''Metaspriggina'''''\n| genus_authority = Simonetta & Insom 1993\n| species = '''''M. walcotti'''''\n| binomial = ''Metaspriggina walcotti''\n| binomial_authority = Simonetta & Insom 1993<ref>{{cite book| last = Van der Laan| first = Richard| title = Family-group names of fossil fishes| year = 2016| publisher = | doi= 10.13140/RG.2.1.2130.1361| url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317888989}}</ref><ref>{{cite website | website=Collection of genus-group names in a systematic arrangement | title=Part 7- Vertebrates | url=http://mave.tweakdsl.nl/tn/genera7.html | display-authors=etal | access-date=30 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114629/http://mave.tweakdsl.nl/tn/genera7.html | archive-date=5 October 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Metaspriggina''''' is a genus of [[chordate]] initially known from two specimens in the [[Cambrian|Middle Cambrian]] [[Burgess Shale]]<ref name=\"ConwayMorris2008\">{{cite journal |last=Conway Morris |first=Simon |date=March 2008 |title=A Redescription of a Rare Chordate, ''Metaspriggina walcotti'' Simonetta and Insom, from the Burgess Shale (Middle Cambrian), British Columbia, Canada |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=[[Paleontological Society|The Paleontological Society]] |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=424\u2013430 |doi=10.1666/06-130.1 |issn=0022-3360 }}</ref> and 44 specimens found in 2012 at the [[Marble Canyon (Canadian Rockies)|Marble Canyon]] bed in [[Kootenay National Park]].<ref name=\"ConwayMorrisCaron2014\" />\n[[File:Metaspriggina NT small.jpg|thumb|Life reconstruction of ''Metaspriggina walcotti'']]\n\n[[File:Metaspriggina.png|thumbnail|left|Reconstruction of ''Metaspriggina'' based on the Burgess Shale specimens available then.<ref name=\"ConwayMorris2008\" /><ref name=\"royalonta\">{{Burgess Shale species | 81}}</ref>]]\n\nWhilst named after the [[Ediacara biota|Ediacaran organism]] ''[[Spriggina]]'', later work has shown the two to be unrelated.<ref name=\"ConwayMorris2008\" /> ''Metaspriggina'' is considered to represent a primitive [[chordate]], possibly transitional between [[cephalochordate]]s and the earliest [[vertebrate]]s, albeit this has been questioned because it seems to possess most of the characteristics attributed to [[craniate]]s.
