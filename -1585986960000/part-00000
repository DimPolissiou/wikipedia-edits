He battles Alan Scott in a physical fight. According to the mini-series, he had a daughter he could not see and was hoping to earn enough money committing robberies to win her back. Later he joins the forces of Tex Thompson (secretly Ultra-Humanite in Thompson's body). He dies trying to save a little girl from being killed by Dynaman. His death convinces Alan Scott to join the fight.\n\nThe Earth-One version of the character (see [[DC Comics Multiverse]]) had the same name and origin, but was the foe of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. He also married his universe's version of the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]. After losing a villains versus heroes baseball game, they reformed and have not been seen since. Since the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', this version was apparently wiped from existence or merged with his Earth-2 counterpart.\n\n===Victor Gover===\n====Pre-Zero Hour====\nThere was also another Sportsmaster whose identity was '''Victor Gover''', a former African-American football player who possessed \"photographic reflexes.\" Blacklisted from the world of professional sports after his meta-human abilities were revealed, he turned to crime with a special armored suit that he wore. He fought against [[Manhunter (Mark Shaw)|Manhunter]] and later became a member of the [[Suicide Squad]] for one mission during [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]. They are sent on an intelligence-gathering mission against the magic-user [[Circe (DC Comics)|Circe]]. The Sportsmaster's allies included [[Black Adam]], [[Javelin (DC Comics)|Javelin]], and the author avatar of [[Grant Morrison]]. Sportsmaster was one of the few members to survive this mission.<ref>\"Suicide Squad #58 (1991)</ref>\n\n====Post-Zero Hour====\nFollowing the events of Zero Hour, the character of Victor Gover was radically altered. Victor Gover was now a white male with blonde hair, who no longer had photographic reflex powers, but was a disgraced all-American athlete who turned to crime due to an addiction to gambling. Furthermore, he also wore an exact replica of the original Sportsmaster's costume. Fighting  [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], Victor was betting on himself as part of a betting parlor based on metahuman fights. Gover then fought against a handicapped JSA, who were taking a dive to ensure the kidnapped [[Ma Hunkel]]'s safety. After Wildcat freed Ma Hunkel, the JSA quickly routed him. Wildcat then took Gover to the alley where the whole incident began, beat Gover savagely, and forced Gover to retire as a supervillain and attend [[Gamblers Anonymous]].\n\n===Sportsmen===\nThere were two individuals who modeled their modus operandi after the Sportsmaster, the Sportsman of Earth-2 and the Sportsman of Earth-1.\n\nThe Earth-2 version gained his powers from absorption of an anti-proton globe which enhanced his physical attributes and allowed him to wield seemingly telekinetic control of various sports related implements. This version embarked on a life of crime as a result of the globe's effect on the rational functions of his cerebral cortex. He battled several heroes including the Golden Age [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Robin]] and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]].\n\nThe Earth-1 version was Martin Mantle, Jr. and appeared only in ''Batman'' #338 (1981). During Mantle's youth, his father, disgusted by his son's poor athletic performance, forcibly subjected him to unsafe enhancement treatment in a twisted attempt to make him more \"manly.\" Although emotionally scarred by the incident, Mantle indeed grew up to become a champion athlete, only to learn his father's procedure was altering his body in a way that would eventually kill him. As the Sportsman, he embarked on a brief life of crime with Olympian-level physical attributes and specialized equipment of his own design. His adversary was the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[Batman]] who allowed him to \"win\" once he became aware that Mantle's life was nearing its end.\n\n===''Final Crisis Aftermath''===\nA Sportsmaster appears as one of [[General Immortus]]' followers in ''[[Final Crisis Aftermath]]: Run!''. His real name, origin, and any connection to Crock have yet to be revealed. He is killed in an explosion. His look is modeled on the Earth-One Sportsman.<ref>\"Final Crisis Aftermath: Run\" #1-4 (2009)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), a character named '[[Mad Dog (DC Comics)|Mad Dog]]' appears in ''Suicide Squad #3''. His appearance is based on the Lawrence Crock version of Sportsmaster that appeared in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.<ref>''Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #3</ref>\n\nThe Lawrence Crock version of Sportsmaster appears as a member of Leviathan.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCrock uses sporting-themed weapons such as exploding [[baseball]]s, flying [[Base (baseball)|bases]], rocket [[baseball bat]]s, knockout [[basketball]]s, [[lacrosse]] snare nets, exploding [[hockey]] pucks. Their outfits generally included a baseball cap, catcher's mask, padded [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]], [[catcher]]'s chestguard, [[American football|football]]-style pants, and cleats.<ref name=\"dc-ency-aw\"/>\n\nEach of the Sportsmasters and Sportsmen had superb physical attributes on par with Olympic athletes in their prime.

A former member of [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]], he is introduced as the top assassin and enforcer of [[Project Cadmus]]' Board of Directors, otherwise known as \"[[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]\". In the first season, Sportsmaster uses his relationship to Artemis to blackmail her into joining the Light, only for her to betray and capture him. Having escaped from custody sometime during the 5 years preceding the second season, he vows vengeance on [[Black Manta]] for Artemis' supposed murder at the hands of Manta's son, [[Kaldur'ahm]].

The [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] of St. Anna is a [[Hydrology|hydrological]] nature monument of local importance. Stable water [[temperature]] is 6\u0421 (43F). This temperature remains the same, regardless of season. The spring of St. Anna is protected by the [[government]].\n\n== History ==\nThe healing features of spring water in the St. Anna spring have been recognized since 16th century. There are several [[Legend|legends]] that explain how the spring and church appeared in this place.\n\nThe first legend is about a former owner of the village Onyshkivtsi, whose name was Skorbnyk. He was seriously ill and spent a lot of money on doctor visits. Fearing for his life and no longer relying on human help, he finally asked God for help. Shedding many tears, he prayed to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] from his home. Skorbnyk asked for the forgiveness of his sins and healing of his disease. In a dream, he saw the Virgin Mary and promised her he would build a small [[chapel]] after he becomes healthy again. She pointed to a place where the chapel should be erected.\n\nLegend has it that the Virgin Mary was sighted at that exact place. The Virgin Mary ordered Skorbnyk to take the [[icon]] he was praying to when his healing was received, and place it in the chapel. After his healing, Skorbnyk immediately built a chapel on the specified location and moved there with a procession from his house. Shortly thereafter, Skorbnyk presented the village of Onyschkivtsi to another owner and moved to different village. When Skorbnyk was moving, he wanted to take his beloved icon with him, so he sent a boy to the chapel to retrieve it. With the icon of St. Anna in hand, the boy attempted to leave the chapel, however, an invisible force blocked the exit. The boy was terrified and could not move. In tears, he placed the icon back in the exact spot he had taken it from. The news of this [[miracle]] spread quickly and many people started to come with a hope of healing.\n\nThe second legend is slightly different. It was said that long ago, at the place where the spring is, there was a church. When the land suffered devastating attacks from the [[Tatars]], the church was destroyed, but remained at the same place as if it were hiding somewhere underground. In time, Onyshkivtsi rebuilt the church, however, a miracle took place at the location of the old chapel. Sightings of the icon of St. Anna appeared first to the children-[[Shepherd|shepherds]]. The farmers gathered where the sightings had taken place and brought the icon to the new church. However, the next day the icon appeared back in the place where it was originally found, which happened to be the site of the old church. Local people attempted to bring it back to the new church, this time with all the rituals. But again, the very next day, the icon had reappeared at its original location. It became clear to the people that Saint Anna herself had chosen this place. As a result of this revelation, a chapel was built in the location St. Anna had chosen and soon after, the healing spring appeared.\n\n== Modern times ==\nIn 1991 a new stone church was opened in honor of St. Anna. Where the springs are, a wooden platform was later replaced by concrete slabs and cement [[Walkway|walkways]] were constructed for visitor\u2019s convenience. An asphalt road now leads to the spring. On the south side of the church, there is a pool where people can immerse after prayer. On the north side there is a wall in the form of the [[iconostasis]], displaying icons. By the springs, there are changing rooms and an enclosed pool.\n\nIn 2000, the St. Nicholas [[monastery]] for women opened. Future plans for the construction of a larger monastery are in the development stages as well.\n\n== St. Anna Spring and Health ==\nWater temperature in the spring is always 6\u0421 (43F) degrees, regardless of the [[Weather|weather conditions]].\n\nOne of the secrets of healing springs is the presence of [[silver]] and [[flint]] in the water. Silver ions have antibacterial features. Organic remains of flint are capable of processing light energy in the tens of thousands of times the speed of regenerating reactions. Normal tap water, processed through flint, becomes healthier and can be preserved for many years. Flint water is [[Bactericide|bactericidal]]. It destroys the [[influenza]] virus, quickly stops external [[bleeding]], soothes a toothache, is effective for [[angina]] and running nose, paradontosis, and eliminates [[heartburn]].\n\nIt is also effective for [[Chronic condition|chronic diseases]] of stomach and [[duodenum]]. Flint water can reduce the sugar level in blood, eliminate sand from the kidney and gall bladder, affect the normalization of liver and kidney functions, improve [[metabolism]], and significantly improve the overall health. It has also been said that water from St. Anna spring can heal women from [[Sterility (physiology)|sterility]].\n\n== References ==\n* [https://dzherelo.com.ua \u043e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0456 \u041e\u043d\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456]\n* https://\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0432.com.ua/istochnik_svyatoy_anny\n* [https://istochnik.in.ua \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u043d\u044b]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsyludM_zJE \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0443 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u043d\u044b]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/istochnik.anny/ \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 Facebook \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u043d\u044b]\n\n{{coord|50|10|48|N|25|35|47|E|source:kolossus-ukwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spring Of St. Anna, Rivne Region, Ukraine}}\n[[Category:Geography of Rivne Oblast]]\n[[Category:Springs of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Rivne Oblast]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures in Ukraine]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{cleanup|date=June 2010}}}}\n[[File:\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0457\u0410\u043d\u043d\u043801.jpg|thumb|right|Spring of St. Anna]]\n'''Spring of St. Anna''' is located one kilometer from the village Onyshkivtsi, [[Rivne]] region, [[Ukraine]].

The caller is Mrs. Rawlingson with whom Maureen \"Piggie\" Gilpin and her friend Maud Dalborough once stayed when temporarily stranded in Samolo in the South Pacific during a world cruise. On seeing the message, Piggie explains to her husband, Commander Peter Gilpin, [[Royal Navy|RN]], that Mrs Rawlingson and her husband are visiting London and, having asked them to tea, Piggie has forgotten the appointment until now (extending or accepting and then forgetting invitations is a habit of hers). She makes urgent phone calls to recruit friends to join her to entertain the Rawlingsons, and Peter persuades a naval colleague to invite the visitors to tour the naval dockyard at [[Portsmouth]] during their stay.\n\nAs soon as the Gilpins leave the room, Walters ushers in Mr and Mrs Wadhurst, a couple whom Piggie and Maud met in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. As with the Rawlingsons, Piggie has invited them to tea and then forgotten about the appointment. Another visitor is shown in: Mr Burnham, a young employee of a company that is designing a speed boat for Peter. He and the Wadhursts make polite, slightly stiff conversation. While they wait for the Gilpins to appear, Clare Wedderburn and Bogey Gosling, close friends of the Gilpins, arrive. Clare and Bogey make themselves loudly at home and liberally hand round cocktails.\n\nPiggie enters, greets her old friends and welcomes the Wadhursts, whom she mistakes for the Rawlingsons. Conversation is continually interrupted by the telephone on which Piggie and later Peter and Clare are called to talk to other friends, which they do uninhibitedly, to the confusion of the Wadhursts.  At one point, Burnham rises and tries to give Peter a long roll of cardboard, but is thwarted when Peter is again called to the telephone. The conversation is interrupted again when Piggie takes a call from Mrs. Rawlingson, who apologises that she and her husband cannot come after all. Piggie, realising her error, tries to discover tactfully who the Wadhursts actually are. Just as they are about to leave to go to the theatre, Mrs Wadhurst mentions Pendarla, where she and Wadhurst live. This finally jogs Piggie's memory, and she bids them an effusive farewell, inviting them to dine one evening and go to the theatre. She and the Wadhursts leave the room.\n\nClare, like Piggie, has assumed that Burnham is the Wadhursts' son.  She is puzzled when he does not leave with them. He explains who he is, and that he has brought the designs for Peter's new boat. Piggie, meanwhile, takes another telephone call and apologises to her caller for forgetting their engagement that afternoon. As Burnham creeps out, she, still unaware that he is not the Wadhursts' son, bids him goodbye: \"It's been absolutely lovely, you're the sweetest family I've ever met in my life.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Times]]'' said of the play: \"As a piece of production it is, technically, of the utmost brilliance; as an entertainment, in its own kind frothily faultless.\"<ref>''The Times'', 14 January 1936, p. 12</ref> Coward's fellow-dramatist [[Terence Rattigan]] considered it \"the best short comedy ever written.\"<ref>Hoare, p. 270</ref> In the introduction to his collected plays Coward comments:\n{{blockindent|It is a gay, unpretentious little play, and it was acted by Gertie with incomparable brilliance.

The caller is Mrs. Rawlingson with whom Maureen \"Piggie\" Gilpin and her friend Maud Dalborough once stayed when temporarily stranded in Samolo in the South Pacific during a world cruise. On seeing the message, Piggie explains to her husband, Commander Peter Gilpin, [[Royal Navy|RN]], that Mrs Rawlingson and her husband are visiting London and, having asked them to tea, Piggie has forgotten the appointment until now (extending or accepting and then forgetting invitations is a habit of hers). She makes urgent phone calls to recruit friends to join her to entertain the Rawlingsons, and Peter persuades a naval colleague to invite the visitors to tour the naval dockyard at [[Portsmouth]] during their stay.\n\nAs soon as the Gilpins leave the room, Walters ushers in Mr and Mrs Wadhurst, a couple whom Piggie and Maud met in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. As with the Rawlingsons, Piggie has invited them to tea and then forgotten about the appointment. Another visitor is shown in: Mr Burnham, a young employee of a company that is designing a speed boat for Peter. He and the Wadhursts make polite, slightly stiff conversation. While they wait for the Gilpins to appear, Clare Wedderburn and Bogey Gosling, close friends of the Gilpins, arrive. Clare and Bogey make themselves loudly at home and liberally hand round cocktails.\n\nPiggie enters, greets her old friends and welcomes the Wadhursts, whom she mistakes for the Rawlingsons. Conversation is continually interrupted by the telephone on which Piggie and later Peter and Clare are called to talk to other friends, which they do uninhibitedly, to the confusion of the Wadhursts.  At one point, Burnham rises and tries to give Peter a long roll of cardboard, but is thwarted when Peter is again called to the telephone. The conversation is interrupted again when Piggie takes a call from Mrs. Rawlingson, who apologises that she and her husband cannot come after all. Piggie, realising her error, tries to discover tactfully who the Wadhursts actually are. Just as they are about to leave to go to the theatre, Mrs Wadhurst mentions Pendarla, where she and Wadhurst live. This finally jogs Piggie's memory, and she bids them an effusive farewell, inviting them to dine one evening and go to the theatre. She and the Wadhursts leave the room.\n\nClare, like Piggie, has assumed that Burnham is the Wadhursts' son.  She is puzzled when he does not leave with them. He explains who he is, and that he has brought the designs for Peter's new boat. Piggie, meanwhile, takes another telephone call and apologises to her caller for forgetting their engagement that afternoon. As Burnham creeps out, she, still unaware that he is not the Wadhursts' son, bids him goodbye: \"It's been absolutely lovely, you're the sweetest family I've ever met in my life.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Times]]'' said of the play: \"As a piece of production it is, technically, of the utmost brilliance; as an entertainment, in its own kind frothily faultless.\"<ref>''The Times'', 14 January 1936, p. 12</ref> Coward's fellow-dramatist [[Terence Rattigan]] considered it \"the best short comedy ever written.\"<ref>Hoare, p. 270</ref> In the introduction to his collected plays Coward comments:\n{{blockindent|It is a gay, unpretentious little play, and it was acted by Gertie with incomparable brilliance.

Art by [[Harry G. Peter]].]]\n\nIn the story, Hippolyte and the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] once resided in \"Amazonia\" in the days of ancient Greece, until they were beguiled and bested by the demi-god [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], who had been inspired by the God of War [[Ares (DC Comics)|Mars]], to go after her. She was able to beat him thanks to the magic girdle, but he seduced her, and tricked her into removing the girdle, allowing him to steal it. This caused the Amazons to lose their super strength and the favor of their patron goddess, [[Aphrodite]]. Eventually she and the other Amazons were forgiven, but had to wear [[Wonder Woman's bracelets|bracelets]] to remind them of the folly of submitting to men. To regain their status, the Amazons were decreed to leave the mortal world and relocate to [[Paradise Island (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]. There they established their own society, free from the evils of man's world. So long as they remained there and Hippolyte retained possession of her magic girdle, the Amazons would be immortal. Much of this history was adapted, varied, and expanded upon in the modern version of the ''Wonder Woman'' comics.\n\nFor the most part, Hippolyte remained on Paradise Island during the Golden Age era, rarely interacting with the modern world to which her daughter had journeyed. Her role was that of the Amazon Queen and mentor to Wonder Woman. She was devoted to the Olympian goddesses, particularly the Amazons' patron Aphrodite, and was adamant that man never be allowed to set foot on Paradise Island. Although she remained mainly on the island, in one story from ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #26 (reprinted in ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History''), Hippolyte travels to Man's World and briefly assumes the role of Wonder Woman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=4362 |title=Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics \u2013 The CD Indexes |publisher=Dcindexes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185605/http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=4362 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref> In the first appearance of Villany inc she is kidnapped to lure Wonder Woman into a trap.\n\nIn the late 1950s, DC Comics introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], and the Golden Age Hippolyte was established as existing on the world known as [[Earth-Two]]. The last appearance of this incarnation of Hippolyte was in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #97 in April 1958, after which the focus shifted from Earth-Two to the more modern versions of the characters on [[Earth-One]].\n\n===Silver and Bronze Ages===\n[[File:Hippolyta-DC Comics-Wonder Woman v. 1 No. 105 (1959).png|thumb|150px|The Silver and Bronze Age Hippolyta was depicted as blonde. From ''Wonder Woman'' (vol.1) #105 (April 1959).]]\nAs of ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #98 (May 1958), the Amazon Queen's name was spelled \"Hippolyta\", and she was depicted with blonde hair and a triple pointed tiara. The backstory of this \n[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hippolyta was largely identical to the Golden Age version, with some exceptions. For example, it was established in a 1973 storyline that Hippolyta had crafted a second daughter from clay, a dark-skinned Amazon named [[Nubia (comics)|Nubia]] who was to be Wonder Woman's sister before she was spirited away by the god Mars.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #204\u2013206 (February 1973 - July 1973)</ref> Hippolyta was also the adoptive mother of [[Donna Troy]], who had been rescued from a fire and brought to Paradise Island. As before, Hippolyta's role in the Silver Age era was primarily that of Paradise Island's queen and mentor to Wonder Woman. She was frequently shown interacting with her daughter as well as supporting characters of the era such as [[Wonder Girl]] and Wonder Tot. According to the DC Comics 1976 calendar, Hippolyta was born on January 8.\n\nHippolyta was also instrumental in several of the continuity shake-ups for the Earth-One Wonder Woman. Enraged that her daughter, recovering from amnesia, had submitted to trials by the [[Justice League]] to prove her worth to rejoin, she created her own test which involved resurrecting [[Steve Trevor]] to lead an assault on Paradise Island. The goddess Aphrodite granted Diana's wish to allow the resurrected Trevor to continue living (although he was later revealed to be Eros animating Trevor's body). After Trevor had again been killed and a grief-stricken Diana returned home, Hippolyta erased Diana's memories of him; when a Trevor from a parallel universe burst through the barriers between worlds and crashed off Paradise Island, Hippolyta asked Aphrodite to alter the memories of the entire world to allow the new Trevor to embark upon a life on Earth-One.\n\nIn 1985, the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries revised DC Comics continuity and combined the multiple Earths into one world. The modern version of Hippolyta would combine elements of her earlier incarnations and take on greater importance in the series.\n\n===Modern Age===\n[[File:QueenHippolyta.png|thumb|150px|Hippolyta as she appears from the 1987 reboot until 2011's ''[[The New 52]]''. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]] (2002).]]\n\n====Origin====\nHippolyta's origins underwent a revision after writer [[George P\u00e9rez]]' revamp of Wonder Woman in 1987. In that continuity, Hippolyta and the rest of the [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscirian]] Amazons were created by a select group of the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian gods]], which included [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]] and [[Aphrodite]]. These goddesses reincarnated the souls of women gathered by the earth-goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] (women who had been slain by man's ignorance and fear). They sent these souls (Hippolyta's original incarnation was a pregnant cavewoman slain circa 32,000 BCE) to the bottom of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The souls then began to merge with the clay on the sea bed. The first reincarnated Amazon to break the surface was Hippolyta, and thus she was titled as Queen of the new race; in this version Hippolyta stood 5'9\", weighed approximately 130&nbsp;lbs, had curly black hair and more. The second Amazon to break the surface was her sister [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]] and she ruled at Hippolyta's side. Each of the goddesses then blessed the Amazon nation with gifts: hunting skills (Artemis), wisdom (Athena), warm homes (Hestia), plentiful harvests (Demeter), and beauty inside and out (Aphrodite). As a symbol of their responsibilities, the goddesses gave Hippolyta and Antiope each a [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]]. The Amazons eventually founded the city of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in [[Anatolia]] and became known as fierce warriors of peace in [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]].\n\n====Heracles====\nThe jealous and vengeful god [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] tried to drive a wedge between Amazons and other civilizations by influencing his half-brother, the demi-god [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]] to challenge the Amazons. When Heracles first approached the Amazons seeking battle, Hippolyta met him outside the city gates and tried to employ peaceful negotiations. When this did not work, Heracles attacked the Amazon Queen. Hippolyta easily turned the tables on him by using her wisdom and battle skills to subdue him. Still wishing peace, Hippolyta invited Heracles and his men into their city to celebrate a potential friendship with a feast. Heracles seemingly accepted the invitation.\n\nOnce in their city, Heracles and his men drugged the Amazons' wine and took them prisoner. After the theft of Hippolyta's Golden Girdle and abuse and rape of the Amazons, Hippolyta cried out to Athena to help them escape their bonds. Athena said that she would only aid them on the condition that the Amazons not seek retribution against Heracles and his men as that would be beneath the ideals of the Amazons. Hippolyta agreed and her bonds were broken. Hippolyta freed the other Amazons. The Amazons, however, were filled with hate and the desire for revenge. Breaking Hippolyta's oath to Athena, the Amazons began slaughtering their captors, (Heracles and his general [[Theseus]] had left).\n\nAfter they had killed all the men keeping them prisoners, [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]] renounced all ties to the Olympian gods and said goodbye to her sister Hippolyta, giving Hippolyta her Golden Girdle of Gaea to replace the one stolen by Heracles. She left to pursue vengeance, intending to kill Heracles and Theseus. Antiope's tribe later became the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]].\n\n====Godly penance====\nHippolyta and the remaining faithful Amazons then went to the sea shore where [[Athena]] told them their punishment for betraying their ideals. They were to be given immortality so that they could forever safeguard a doorway to a place of unspeakable evil. The doorway was on a far-off isolated island and it took months to get there. To guide their way, the god [[Poseidon]] cleared a pathway for them across the seas. Once they arrived, the Amazons created a new city and named their new home Themyscira, after their previous fallen city. The Amazons continued to live on the island guarding this \"Doom's Doorway\" (later shown to also lead to other places such as parts of Hades) and paying homage to their gods for three-thousand years.\n\n====Diana's birth====\nHippolyta began to ache for something unknown. She was told by the oracle [[Menalippe]] that the yearning she felt was for her unborn daughter. She was instructed to go to the beach and form a figure of an infant out of the island's clay. The original five goddesses, plus Hermes, united to incarnate and bless this final soul. They imbued it with many gifts and merged it with the clay form and, just as with the previous Amazons, the clay was changed into flesh and blood. Hippolyta named the child Diana, after a \"great and holy warrior,\" a stranger who had washed ashore on the island and died helping the Amazons defeat [[Hecatoncheires|Cottus]], a creature escaping Doom's Doorway. This Diana was later revealed to be the mother of Steve Trevor, who as a pilot had crashed near the island in the 1940s.\n\n====Return of Heracles====\nDuring Diana's ''[[Challenge of the Gods (comics)|Challenge of the Gods]]'' storyline,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #10-11 (November\u2013December 1987)</ref><ref name=ww12>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #12 (January 1988)</ref><ref name=ww13>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #13 (February 1988)</ref> she discovered that Heracles was transformed into a colossal stone pillar within Doom's Doorway, and was supporting Themyscira's weight for several millennia.<ref name=ww12/> In this state he was tormented and scarred by various mythological creatures, feeling the pain inflicted by them but not being able to do anything about it (much like [[Prometheus]]).<ref name=ww13/> This was the punishment given to him for his past transgressions. Thanks to Diana, Hippolyta, and the Lasso of Truth, he was restored to his original form and begged the Amazons for forgiveness.  Though some of the Amazons still harbored anger for their past humiliation, most of them were moved by Heracles' newfound humility, and Queen Hippolyta asked her people to search their hearts for the strength to forgive, which they almost immediately did. Doing so herself, Hippolyta not only forgave Heracles, but shared a brief kiss with him before he left the mortal realm to return to his father in Olympus.<ref name=ww14>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #14 (March 1988)</ref>\n\n====Return to the outside world====\nAfter Diana's completion of her challenge, the Amazons were released from their punishment by the Olympian gods. They were free to live out their lives any way they saw fit while retaining their immortality.<ref name=ww14 /> To celebrate, Hippolyta declared that Themyscira would finally create cultural exchange with the outside world. Diana became Themyscira's ambassador to the U.N.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #37-40 (December 1989 - March 1990))</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #50 (January 1991)</ref>\n\nIn spreading the Amazon ideals of love and peace, Diana made a powerful enemy, the sorceress [[Circe (comics)|Circe]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #17-19 (June\u2013August 1988)</ref> One of Circe's attacks on Diana involved the brainwashing of Hippolyta, transforming her into the second [[Shim'Tar]], or chief warrior, of the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #60 (November 1991)</ref><ref>''War of the Gods'' #3 (November 1991)</ref> In this persona, Hippolyta attacked Diana, and was defeated by a ricochet from Diana's bracelets.\n\nCirce considered all Amazons to be her enemy and later made a new plan for revenge. She teleported the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall to Themyscira on the pretense that they were to take the island. While the two groups fought, Circe teleported the island to a dimension of demons. There the two groups of Amazons were forced to put aside their rivalry in order to stave off the demons' attacks. The Amazons remained in the demon dimension until Diana discovered what had happened and forced Circe to return the island back to its rightful dimension.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #89 (August 1994)</ref> They found upon their return that although their time in the demon dimension lasted several years, the time passed in our dimension was only a few months.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #90 (september 1994)</ref>\n\nIn this time the Themyscirian and Bana-Mighdallian Amazons made an uneasy truce. The Themyscirians would live in the city while the Bana-Mighdallians would form their own settlement on the opposite side of the island. In Hippolyta's mind she still served as Queen over all Amazons on the island, but the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons did not see it as such and tensions between the two tribes remained.<ref name=ww168>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #168 (May 2001)</ref>\n\n====Motherly deception====\nBecause the demon dimension they were in was magic based, Hippolyta began to receive dreams and visions of the future. In one such dream she foresaw Wonder Woman's death. Fearful for her daughter's welfare, she put into motion a plan to remove Diana from her role as Wonder Woman and replace the title of Themyscira's Champion to another Amazon. Thus a new Contest for the title was made though she kept her true reasons for calling the new Contest to herself alone. Initially Hippolyta thought the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall were not worthy to enter the Contest but when Diana, angered at her mother's treatment of the new Amazons, called a vote on the whole to see if her people also agreed that they should be allowed to participate, the answer was yes. Suddenly inspired, Hippolyta noticed that the Bana-Mighdallian's most likely warrior to win was the Amazon [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]]. Hippolyta then in secret went to the Themyscirian Amazon mystic Magala. She had Magala transfer half of Diana's gods-given powers over to Artemis in order for Artemis' victory to be better equipped.<ref name=ww124>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #124 (August 1997)</ref> Hippolyta also provided many additional obstacles for Diana to encounter during her Contest trials in order for her to become sidetracked from the goal of winning. Due to her actions, Artemis became the Contest's winner and the new champion Wonder Woman. Later when Diana began to receive visions of the past she confronted her mother on why she really called for a new Contest. When Hippolyta told her she and Diana's relationship became scarred as Diana never truly forgave her mother for knowingly sending another Amazon to her death.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #90, 0, 91-99 (September 1994 - July 1995)</ref>\n\n====Wonder Woman====\nAfter Artemis was killed in battle the title of Wonder Woman was returned to Diana. This sent Hippolyta into a deep depression as she realized she was the cause of an innocent's death. Hippolyta gave command to the Amazon General [[Philippus (fictional character)|Philippus]] and went into self-imposed banishment.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #104 (December 1995)</ref>\n\nHippolyta boarded a small boat and let it cast adrift. She eventually landed in Louisiana where she met a psychic named Angela.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #112 (August 1996)</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #114-115 (October\u2013November 1996)</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #118-119 (February\u2013March 1997)</ref> After becoming friends with Angela and her family, Angela informed Hippolyta that her daughter was in serious danger.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #123 (July 1997)</ref> Rushing to her aid, Hippolyta arrived too late to save Diana from the demon [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]], as Diana was still suffering from the spell that had reduced her strength.<ref name=ww124 /> Thus, Hippolyta's vision of her daughter dying as Wonder Woman came true.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #125-126 (September\u2013October 1997)</ref>\n\n[[File:Hippolyta (DC Comics) as WW - from WW v2 i130.png|thumb|upright|Hippolyta as [[Wonder Woman]] from ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #130 (Feb. 1998).

Whereas Diana used the Lasso of Truth as her primary weapon, Hippolyta favored a broad sword and wore a short blue skirt instead of briefs.\n\nJohn Byrne, the writer that introduced the concept of Hippolyta as the first Wonder Woman, has explained his intentions in a post in his message board:\n<blockquote>''I thought George's one \"mistake\" in rebooting Wonder Woman was making her only 25 years old when she left Paradise Island. I preferred the idea of a Diana who was thousands of years old (as, if I recall correctly, she was in the TV series). From that angle, I would have liked to have seen Diana having been Wonder Woman in WW2, and be returning to our world in the reboot.''</blockquote>\n<blockquote>''Not having that option, I took the next best course, and had Hippolyta fill that role.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17792 |title=Wonder Woman revisited |publisher=Byrne Robotics |date= |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Wonder Woman, Queen Hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with [[Jay Garrick]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #130-133 (February\u2013May 1998)</ref> After this mission, she elected to join the [[Justice Society of America]] and remained in that era for eight years, where her teammates nicknamed her \"Polly\". During that time she had a relationship with [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Ted Grant]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #185 (November 2002)</ref> Hippolyta also made visits into the past to see her godchild [[Fury (DC Comics)|Lyta]], daughter of Hippolyta's protege Helena, the Golden Age Fury.{{Issue|date=February 2008}} These visits happened yearly from young Lyta's perspective and also accounted for Hippolyta's participation in the JSA/JLA team ups. When she returned from the past, Hippolyta took Diana's place in the [[Justice League|JLA]] as well.<ref>''JLA'' #18-23 (May\u2013October 1998)</ref><ref>''JLA'' #30 (June 1999)</ref>\n\nEventually Diana gave up her godhood and returned to her role as Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #136 (August 1998)</ref> Still clinging to her newfound sense of freedom, Hippolyta did not wish to relinquish her title as Wonder Woman (even though she admitted her daughter looked \"better in a bathing suit\" than she did), leaving two different Wonder Women acting in the same role at the same time. Diana was often unhappy with Hippolyta's continued role as Wonder Woman as she felt Hippolyta was ignoring her ''true'' duties as ruler of Themyscira, thus further inciting the antagonism between mother and daughter.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #171 (August 2001)</ref>\n\nAround this time Hippolyta discovered that the hero [[Donna Troy]] was actually a mirror image of her daughter Diana, brought to life through Themyscirian sorceries. Though Hippolyta had met Donna on previous adventures, when the two women met again after learning this fact, Hippolyta accepted Donna as a second daughter and held a coronation on the island, proclaiming Donna to be the second Amazon princess and an heir to the Themyscirian throne.<ref>''Wonder Woman Secret Files and Origins'' #3 (May 2002)</ref>\n\nOn one visit to the island, Diana discovered that the two tribes of Amazons were on the verge of a civil war due to unresolved issues and mysterious acts of sabotage made on the Bana-Mighdallian's construction of their city. When both Diana and Donna confronted Hippolyta about her inaction of rule at such a dangerous time, Hippolyta became very upset with her two daughters and told them that she intended to continue her role as Wonder Woman in the outside world and that Diana and Donna were to rule the island in her absence. Unfortunately the civil war took place after all and many Amazons on both sides were killed. Returning to the island, Hippolyta and Diana agreed to denounce their royal titles in order for both Amazon tribes to have an opportunity for peace, having both tribes gain equal footing in united rule.<ref name=ww169>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #169 (June 2001)</ref><ref name=ww168/>\n\n====Death====\nHippolyta continued to establish a distinguished [[career]] as Wonder Woman. The Queen enjoyed her role in the Justice Society and became accustomed to life in the [[United States]]. Mother and daughter fought on several occasions over Hippolyta's past expected roles \u2014 hero or queen \u2014 and their differences were unresolved when the queen sacrificed herself to save the [[Earth]] from [[Imperiex]] during the Imperiex War featured in ''[[Our Worlds at War]]''.<ref name=ww172>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #172 (September 2001)</ref> Ironically Hippolyta died at the birthplace of the Amazons, near the [[Aegean Sea]] in [[Greece]]. However she was allowed to see her daughter one last time and say goodbye. She, the spirit of her sister Antiope, and [[Steve Trevor]]'s mother Diana Rockwell Trevor became ghostly guardians of the island watching over both tribes as their distant and former queens.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #188 (March 2003)</ref>\n\n====One Year Later====\nAs part of the ''[[Amazons Attack!|Amazons Attack]]'' storyline, the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] revived Hippolyta and showed her that the U.S. government illegally kidnapped her daughter Diana.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #8 (June 2007)</ref> She was being tortured until she gave over the plans on how the U.S. government could create their own [[Purple Ray]] to be used as a weapon.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #7 (June 2007)</ref> Angered over this, Hippolyta resumed leadership of the Amazons and had them attack the city of [[Washington, D.C.]] in the hopes of rescuing Diana and serving their own form of justice against the world for their actions. They are shown using winged steeds, and other mythical creatures. During battle Hippolyta discovered that Circe had secretly planned to detonate a [[nuclear weapon]] on Themyscira and gained her revenge on the traitor by impaling the sorceress with a battle spear through the chest. Wonder Woman has an opportunity to kill her mother but does not take it, instead giving the knife to Hippolyta, who will not kill her daughter. Despite the fact that Circe is supposedly dead, Hippolyta seems fully intent on continuing her assault on the United States, even issuing an attack on other locations, including Kansas. Her more chaotic and malicious actions start to concern her Amazon generals. It is later learned that Circe used a portion of her own soul to revive Hippolyta from death. Because of this Hippolyta's persona was tainted by the witch's evil and thus Hippolyta is now a more blood-thirsty being than before.<ref>''Amazons Attack!'' #1-6 (June\u2013October 2007)</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the war all of the Amazons are given false identities and scattered throughout the world.<ref>''Amazons Attack!'' #6 (October 2007)</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #12 (October 2007)</ref> Hippolyta is spared but is banished to live alone on Themyscira, by what appears to be Athena but is later revealed to be the villainous [[Granny Goodness]], who along with the other [[New Gods]] of [[Apokolips]] have imprisoned the Greek deities. In ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', Hippolyta lives in hiding from Granny Goodness and her new brand of Amazons, human recruits being trained as a new generation of her [[Female Furies]]. With the help of island castaways [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] (briefly known as Catwoman), [[Harley Quinn]] and a powerless [[Mary Marvel]], Hippolyta is able to drive Granny out of Thermiscyra and back to Apokolips. After the Greek Gods are freed by Mary, Granny [[Death of the New Gods|is murdered by the mysterious Godkiller]], leaving Hippolyta once more as the Queen of Themyscira.\n\n====The Circle====\nDuring her isolation Hippolyta travels to the four corners of Themyscira, speaking to an Amazon prisoner at each point, asking them if they repent, to which each prisoner replies, \"Never\". However, the fourth and last prisoner, whom Hippolyta identifies as Alkyone, presents her with a wooden tiara with the words \"Our Queen\" across it similar to the one she and Diana both wore as Wonder Woman. Alkyone tells Hippolyta since she denied her the use of any blades, she gnawed in the inscription with her teeth. She goes on to accuse Hippolyta of betrayal for birthing \"The Dragon\", which clearly is a reference to Diana. Alkyone begs her to kill Diana and let them be a tribe again, but Hippolyta adamantly refuses. Alkyone then tells Hippolyta to tell Diana the truth, but again Hippolyta refuses and breaks the wooden tiara in half. As she leaves, Alkyone vows to save Hippolyta and make them a tribe again by killing Diana.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #14 (January 2008)</ref>\n\nAlkyone's past reveals her to have been a member of Hippolyta's Royal Guard along with three other Amazons\u2014Myrto, Charis and Philomela, charged with her personal protection.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #15 (February 2008)</ref> They were viewed as too brutal-minded and overzealous by General [[Philippus (fictional character)|Philippus]], captain of the General Amazon Guard, a viewpoint that was later proven when Alkyone learned that Hippolyta desired a child. This came to a head when Alkyone learned from the Amazon sorceress, Magala that another Amazon named Gennes had supposedly given birth to a daughter. But it turned out the baby was nothing more than a clay doll carved in the image of a child. Concluding Gennes had gone mad, Alkyone ordered that no such dolls were ever to be crafted on Themyscira again. After that, she ordered Gennes to be killed. In the present day, the army of [[Captain Nazi]] lands on Themyscira, intending to claim it for themselves. Alerted to their arrival, Hippolyta cuts her hair and readies herself for battle and vows to redeem herself for all the mistakes she has made since her resurrection. Elsewhere on the island, Alkyone offers her help and the rest of the former Royal Guard to the soldiers in hunting down Hippolyta in exchange for their release.\n\n====Wonder Woman \u2013 The Movie====\nIn ''Wonder Woman'' issues 24 and 25, there is a movie being made about Diana. In the beginning of issue 24, Diana brings [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Thomas Andrew Tresser]] home to meet her mother, Queen Hippolyta. Hippolyta takes Tresser and leaves Diana alone on the beach. This is her opportunity to get to know the man in whom her daughter has become interested. The getting to know him phase includes taking Tom to the Royal Menagerie to hand feed Griffins of Myth. While there Hippolyta asks rather directly if he and Diana have made love yet. Flustered he is able to honestly answer that they haven't. She asks Tom, \"Will you protect her, keep her from harm, if you are able?\" He replies, \"Yes. That I can promise. Although it usually goes the other way 'round, to be blunt.\" Before he leaves she gives him a spear she has made, grants him the title Sir Thomas of Cleveland, and makes him a guardsman of Themyscira. As Diana and Tom prepare to leave she requests one thing of her new guardsman, babies. As many as he and Diana can create as quickly as they can create them. As they leave the island Alkyone is seen watching them from shore as they float away on a giant shell.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (November\u2013December 2008)</ref>\n\n====Past Imperfect====\nFollowing the events of ''Wonder Woman'' #600, the timeline is altered by the Greek Gods and Hippolyta's history is radically changed once again. Here, Themyscira is invaded by a heavily armed paramilitary group while Diana is still a child, and the majority of the Amazons are wiped out in the ensuing battle. Hippolyta is able to save Diana by entrusting her to several of her servants, who smuggle the child to the United States in the midst of the attack, but Hippolyta herself is ultimately captured by the enemy soldiers. After being bound and presented to the leader of the invaders, Hippolyta commits suicide by throwing herself into a massive fire being used to incinerate the dead Amazons, choosing to die rather than submit to her captors.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #601 (September 2010)</ref> After Wonder Woman's exile in the altered continuity is reversed, Hippolyta is briefly restored to her Modern Age origins,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #614 (October 2011)</ref> greeting her daughter back and approving the changes she had done to her attitude and appearance during her ordeal.\n\n====The New 52====\n[[File:Hippolyta New 52 Look.jpg|thumb|upright|New 52 version of Hippolyta, from ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #2 (December 2011). Art by [[Cliff Chiang]].]]\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Hippolyta receives another major change. Now looking like the Silver Age Hippolyta, youthful and blonde, she retains her edgy, [[women warriors in literature and culture|warrior woman]] attitude. Furthermore, this incarnation of Hippolyta didn't fashion Diana from clay: instead, she bore her daughter from a relationship with Zeus, concocting a lie to protect Diana from Hera's rage.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #3 (January 2012)</ref>\n\nAfter the truth about Diana's birth is revealed, Hera, the queen of the Greek gods, appears on Paradise Island to punish Hippolyta (not for having an affair with her husband, but for having been too weak to resist Zeus' seduction). Hippolyta had predicted this, and asks Hera to take her life in exchange of letting Diana live. However, Hera changes her mind at the last second, and instead of killing Hippolyta, turns her into stone and the rest of the Amazons, minus Diana, into snakes, thus destroying Wonder Woman's home and her only family.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #4 (February 2012)</ref>\n\n====DC Rebirth====\nDuring the 2016 relaunch [[DC Rebirth]], Hippolyta once again goes through a major change. In the \"Year One\" storyline Hippolyta is presented like the Golden Age version with black hair and has a peaceful demeanor. When Steve Trevor lands on the island and is the only survivor of the soldiers, she seeks to have him sent home safely by hosting a competition to determine which Amazon is worthy. She quickly realizes her daughter will be the one to win, something that saddens her since leaving the island forsakes an Amazon's right to return. However, she is nevertheless proud when Diana does indeed win, and they bid each other goodbye.\n\nIn the story arc \"The Lies\" Wonder Woman and Steve seemingly return to Themyscira to find Hippolyta (the New 52 one) and the Amazons safe and sound, despite Wonder Woman remembering her apparent demise. Hippolyta does not understand what she means and only seems suspicious of Steve, telling Diana not to let him wander around alone. However, Diana and Steve begin to notice the inconsistencies: the Amazons are not familiar, they speak English instead of their ancient language, and their architecture has changed. Diana realizes this is because what she thought to be true was a lie: she never returned to Themyscira when she left years before, so the New 52 Hippolyta was an illusion.\n\nIn the present day, Hippolyta and the Amazons take notice of a strange tree growing on the island that serves as a bad omen of events to come. Any attempts to cut down the tree are futile, and Hippolyta worries Diana is in danger. She and her fellow Amazons go to the tree and combat Deimos and Phobos, Ares' sons in wolf-like forms before they are defeated on the other side by Diana. Hippolyta is briefly reunited with her daughter but unable to reach her, stating how proud she is of who Diana has become.\n\nIn the [[Watchmen]] sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Hippolyta was told of her oracle's vision that Wonder Woman will be further injured in her fight with Black Adam during his attack on the United Nations. It was mentioned in a news report that the Amazons showed up during the battle and forcefully took Wonder Woman back to Themyscira.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHippolyta has 3,000 years of combat experience, providing her expertise in both hand-to-hand combat as well as with hand-held weapons. As a Themyscirian Amazon she is ageless and immortal,  allowing her to live indefinitely without physically aging beyond her youthful prime, but is still vulnerable to death upon sufficient injuries and such.<ref name=ww172/><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987)</ref> She also possesses enhanced strength and intelligence. As shown by fellow members of her tribe, she has the capability to break apart steel and concrete with her bare hands,<ref name=ww169/><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #59 (October 1991)</ref> jump over 25 feet from a standing position,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #57 (August 1991)</ref> has a high durability factor,<ref>''Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (October 2001)</ref> enhanced healing,<ref name=ww30>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #30 (May 1989)</ref> and the ability to absorb and process a vast amount of knowledge in a short period of time.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #3 (April 1987)</ref>\n\nHippolyta, also in addition to all the Themyscirian Amazons, possesses the ability to relieve her body of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth's soil and then reforming her body whole again.<ref name=ww30 /> The first time Diana does this she prays to her god [[Gaia (DC Comics)|Gaea]] saying: \"''Gaea, I pray to you. Grant me your strength. You are the Earth who suckled me, who nurtured and bred me. Through you all life is renewed. The circle which never ends. I pray you, mother Gaea, take me into your bosom. Please, let me be worthy.''\" During writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s time on the comic it was stated that this is a very sacred ritual to the Themyscirians, only to be used in the most dire of circumstances.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #120 (April 1997)</ref>\n\nAs an Amazon, Hippolyta had access to a number of magical artifacts. These artifacts included the Gauntlet of Atlas, which greatly increased her overall strength and durability, as well as the Sandals of Hermes, which increased her speed and allowed her to fly. During her time as Wonder Woman, Hippolyta wielded the Lasso of Truth, though she seemed to prefer a broadsword and shield in combat. Her broadsword was created by Hephaestus and was sharp enough to slice the electrons off of an atom.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Hippolyta encourages [[Aquaman]] of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] to marry her daughter, [[Wonder Woman]], after she had been poisoned by a [[Kraken]]. On the wedding day, however, Hippolyta was murdered by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] in disguise as an Atlantean, who in an act of betrayal, was working with [[Ocean Master]]. Diana was actually the target, but Hippolyta took the arrow. This leads to war between the Amazons and Atlanteans.<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the prequel comic to the video game, Hippolyta first appears in Year Two to take her comatose daughter Diana back to Themyscira with the hope that she will be healed. In Year Three, when Diana does not awake even after physically healing, she makes a deal with Hera to awaken Diana if she agrees to an eventual favor. Hera calls upon the favor in Year Four when she orders Hippolyta to lead the Amazons on an attack on Superman and his Regime. Hippolyta is reluctant since Diana is a part of the Regime, and when she refuses she is imprisoned by Hera and Zeus. Eventually she is sent to Tartarus with Harley Quinn and Billy Batson (Shazam), though Harley breaks them out with the use of a Kryptonian super pill and her own bizarre behavior. They are confronted by Ares, though they get away because of a Mother Box. They are then confronted by Darkseid, who imprisons them and reveals that he is aligned with Ares. Superman appears and frees them, leaving them open to flee with the Mother Box to the Himalayas, where they are met by Wonder Woman and Batman. She later joins her daughter in combating the Greek Gods, though the threat of a nuclear bomb stops the fighting. Once Diana takes care of it the New God Highfather intervenes and convinces Zeus and the other gods to leave Earth alone; they agree with the promise of severing all ties, including with the Amazons. In the beginning of Year Five Hippolyta comforts a guilt-ridden Diana and reveals her knowledge of how Diana has romantic feelings for Superman. She encourages her to stand by his side.\n\nIn the sequel comic ''Injustice 2'', the Regime has been overthrown and Diana imprisoned on Themyscira for her actions. Now aware of the full extent of the Regime's tyrannical behavior, Hippolyta tries to convince her daughter her ways are wrong, but Diana rebuffs Hippolyta as being a coward for never trying to better man's world herself. When Kara Zor-El washes ashore the island with the intent of rescuing Diana, Hippolyta is betrayed by a few Amazons who believe in Diana's view and aid in the rescue.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live action====\n[[File:TVQueenHippolyte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cloris Leachman]] as Queen Hippolyta on the ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' series.]]\n* In 1974, the [[Wonder Woman (1974 film)|pilot for Wonder Woman]] was broadcast, with [[Charlene Holt]] cast as Hippolyta. \n* In the 1975 ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' television series starring [[Lynda Carter]], three different actresses portrayed Queen Hippolyta: [[Cloris Leachman]] in ''The New Original Wonder Woman'' TV series [[The New Original Wonder Woman|pilot film]] (1975); [[Carolyn Jones]] in the episodes \"[[The Feminum Mystique]]\" parts 1 and 2 and \"[[Wonder Woman in Hollywood]]\"; and [[Beatrice Straight]] in the episodes \"[[The Return of Wonder Woman]]\" and \"[[The Bermuda Triangle Crisis]]\". The character was never referred to as Queen Hippolyta by name. Wonder Woman and Wonder Girl refer to her as \"Mother\" and the Amazons either refer to her as \"Your Majesty\" or \"The Queen\".\n* An allusion to Hippolyta is made in [[The WB]] television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''. In the 2004 [[Smallville (season 3)|season three]] episode \"[[Asylum (Smallville)|Asylum]]\", a newspaper includes the headline stating: \"Themyscirian Queen Addresses the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]\". Hippolyta is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 1978, an animated Queen Hippolyta was shown on ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' in the episodes \"Secret Origins of the Super Friends\" and \"Super Friends: Rest in Peace\". Queen Hippolyta also appears in the 1980 ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' episode \"Return of Atlantis\". Hippolyta is a brunette in her first two appearances, but is blonde in the third. In that series, Wonder Woman addresses Hippolyta by name rather than \"Mother\".\n* A brunette Queen Hippolyta in the 1988 ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' cartoon episode \"[[Superman and Wonder Woman versus the Sorceress of Time]]\" voiced by [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]. She is attacked by the Sorceress of Time, and herself and the other Amazons are shrunk down to midget size and imprisoned, whereupon she implores Wonder Woman to seek the aid of Superman in battling the Sorceress to reverse this.\n* Hippolyta appears in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:\n** In 2001, Hippolyta was depicted in the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', voiced by actress [[Susan Sullivan]].<ref name=\"Voice\">{{cite web |publisher=BehindtheVoiceActors.com |url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Wonder-Woman/Hippolyta/ |title=Voices of Hippolyta |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> Hippolyta appeared in the episodes \"[[Secret Origins (Justice League episode)|Secret Origins]]\", \"[[Paradise Lost (Justice League episode)|Paradise Lost]]\", \"[[Fury (Justice League episode)|Fury]]\", and \"[[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|Hereafter]]\". While Diana believes that Hippolyta molded her from clay and breathed mystic life into her, Hades says that they molded her together, suggesting that Hades is really Diana's father. Putting her religion and devotion to the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian Gods]] above all, she reluctantly exiles her daughter Diana from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]] rather than risk incurring divine wrath, when Diana brings out-worlders (the Justice League) to Themyscira in \"Paradise Lost\". In this series, it is explained that the Wonder Woman uniform was actually made by the god [[Hephaestus]] for Queen Hippolyta to use (but he cheekily comments that the uniform looks better on Diana). In the episode \"Fury\", Hawkgirl visits Themyscira to get information about Aresia from Hippolyta. A flashback revealed that Aresia's ship was attacked by pirates where she was the only survivor. While riding a horse on the beach, Hippolyta found Aresia's body and the dying captain where Hippolyta buried him in secret. In the present, Aresia captures Hippolyta as her plans to wipe out men goes into its next stage. When Aresia perishes in the plane crash, Hippolyta mourned Aresia's death. Hippolyta is seen comforting Diana following Superman's supposed death in the episode \"Hereafter\".\n** Hippolyta appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"[[The Balance (Justice League Unlimited)|The Balance]]\", voiced again by Susan Sullivan.<ref name=\"Voice\"/> Upon seeing the message that Hermes gave Wonder Woman, Hippolyta lifts the exile she put on her daughter as well as informing her of her full power. Also explored was her one time intimate relationship with the Greek god [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]].\n* In 2011, Hippolyta appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"[[Triumvirate of Terror!]]\", voiced by [[Tippi Hedren]].<ref name=\"Voice\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsonline.com/node/1255 |title=CC2010: ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' Interview with Andrea Romano |publisher=Comicsonline.com |date=July 31, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808173851/http://www.comicsonline.com/node/1255 |archivedate=August 8, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the episode, she is shown holding another contest amongst the Amazons, with Diana and herself presiding over the tournament. The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] infiltrates the tournament disguised as an Amazon, and emerges as the victor after using his Smilex to poison all of the other women in the arena. As the Joker approaches the throne to claim his prize, he removes his disguise and knocks both Diana and Hippolyta unconscious before fleeing the island with Diana as his captive. What happened to Hippolyta after this is not stated.\n* Hippolyta appears in the series ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode \"[[Luthor in Paradise]]\", voiced by [[Julianne Grossman]].<ref name=\"Voice\"/> It is mentioned that her staff is a key to the Forbidden Realm where the Oculus of the ''Argo'' is held that can grant anyone the powers of Zeus, and that artifact was entrusted to Hippolyta by Hera. She is present when Lex Luthor and Circe invade Themyscira in order to obtain a staff that would take them to the Forbidden Realm, where they defeat Hippolyta. After Lex Luthor and Circe are apprehended, Hippolyta has Circe imprisoned in Tartarus. Upon thanking Batman and Superman for helping her daughter and stopping the villains, Hippolyta advises Batman and Superman to get off Themyscira before her soldiers filet them.\n* Hippolyta appears on the 2019 animated series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' voiced by [[Cree Summer]].\n\n===Film===\n====Animation====\n* Actress [[Charlene Holt]] portrayed Queen Hippolyta in the 1974 TV movie ''[[Wonder Woman (1974 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' starring [[Cathy Lee Crosby]].\n* Hippolyta appears in the direct-to-DVD animated movie ''[[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|Wonder Woman]]''. She is voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]].<ref name=\"Voice\"/> Like Cloris Leachman's portrayal in the 1975 TV film, after she learns that Diana had undergone the challenge and won it against her prohibition, she accepts the result without argument. Similarly to her previous animated incarnation, this version of Hippolyta also became romantically involved with a Greek god\u2014Ares, the god of war\u2014whom she imprisoned after she was betrayed by him. She is the mother of Ares' son, Thrax.\n* Hippolyta appeared in the 2016 direct-to-DVD animated film ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Hero of the Year]]'' voiced by Julianne Grossman.<ref name=\"Voice\"/> Grossman reprised her role on the [[DC Super Hero Girls|web series]], ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games|Intergalactic Games]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Legends of Atlantis|Legends of Atlantis]]'', and the Lego shorts.\n* Hippolyta appears in the 2019 animated film ''[[Wonder Woman: Bloodlines]]'', voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. This version is far more hardline than other versions, as she refused to allow Steve Trevor to return home and even disowned Diana when she chose to leave Paradise Island with him.

Art by [[Harry G. Peter]].]]\n\nIn the story, Hippolyte and the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] once resided in \"Amazonia\" in the days of ancient Greece, until they were beguiled and bested by the demi-god [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], who had been inspired by the God of War [[Ares (DC Comics)|Mars]], to go after her. She was able to beat him thanks to the magic girdle, but he seduced her, and tricked her into removing the girdle, allowing him to steal it. This caused the Amazons to lose their super strength and the favor of their patron goddess, [[Aphrodite]]. Eventually she and the other Amazons were forgiven, but had to wear [[Wonder Woman's bracelets|bracelets]] to remind them of the folly of submitting to men. To regain their status, the Amazons were decreed to leave the mortal world and relocate to [[Paradise Island (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]. There they established their own society, free from the evils of man's world. So long as they remained there and Hippolyte retained possession of her magic girdle, the Amazons would be immortal. Much of this history was adapted, varied, and expanded upon in the modern version of the ''Wonder Woman'' comics.\n\nFor the most part, Hippolyte remained on Paradise Island during the Golden Age era, rarely interacting with the modern world to which her daughter had journeyed. Her role was that of the Amazon Queen and mentor to Wonder Woman. She was devoted to the Olympian goddesses, particularly the Amazons' patron Aphrodite, and was adamant that man never be allowed to set foot on Paradise Island. Although she remained mainly on the island, in one story from ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #26 (reprinted in ''Wonder Woman: The Complete History''), Hippolyte travels to Man's World and briefly assumes the role of Wonder Woman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=4362 |title=Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics \u2013 The CD Indexes |publisher=Dcindexes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185605/http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=4362 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref> In the first appearance of Villany inc she is kidnapped to lure Wonder Woman into a trap.\n\nIn the late 1950s, DC Comics introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], and the Golden Age Hippolyte was established as existing on the world known as [[Earth-Two]]. The last appearance of this incarnation of Hippolyte was in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #97 in April 1958, after which the focus shifted from Earth-Two to the more modern versions of the characters on [[Earth-One]].\n\n===Silver and Bronze Ages===\n[[File:Hippolyta-DC Comics-Wonder Woman v. 1 No. 105 (1959).png|thumb|150px|The Silver and Bronze Age Hippolyta was depicted as blonde. From ''Wonder Woman'' (vol.1) #105 (April 1959).]]\nAs of ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #98 (May 1958), the Amazon Queen's name was spelled \"Hippolyta\", and she was depicted with blonde hair and a triple pointed tiara. The backstory of this \n[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hippolyta was largely identical to the Golden Age version, with some exceptions. For example, it was established in a 1973 storyline that Hippolyta had crafted a second daughter from clay, a dark-skinned Amazon named [[Nubia (comics)|Nubia]] who was to be Wonder Woman's sister before she was spirited away by the god Mars.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #204\u2013206 (February 1973 - July 1973)</ref> Hippolyta was also the adoptive mother of [[Donna Troy]], who had been rescued from a fire and brought to Paradise Island. As before, Hippolyta's role in the Silver Age era was primarily that of Paradise Island's queen and mentor to Wonder Woman. She was frequently shown interacting with her daughter as well as supporting characters of the era such as [[Wonder Girl]] and Wonder Tot. According to the DC Comics 1976 calendar, Hippolyta was born on January 8.\n\nHippolyta was also instrumental in several of the continuity shake-ups for the Earth-One Wonder Woman. Enraged that her daughter, recovering from amnesia, had submitted to trials by the [[Justice League]] to prove her worth to rejoin, she created her own test which involved resurrecting [[Steve Trevor]] to lead an assault on Paradise Island. The goddess Aphrodite granted Diana's wish to allow the resurrected Trevor to continue living (although he was later revealed to be Eros animating Trevor's body). After Trevor had again been killed and a grief-stricken Diana returned home, Hippolyta erased Diana's memories of him; when a Trevor from a parallel universe burst through the barriers between worlds and crashed off Paradise Island, Hippolyta asked Aphrodite to alter the memories of the entire world to allow the new Trevor to embark upon a life on Earth-One.\n\nIn 1985, the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries revised DC Comics continuity and combined the multiple Earths into one world. The modern version of Hippolyta would combine elements of her earlier incarnations and take on greater importance in the series.\n\n===Modern Age===\n[[File:QueenHippolyta.png|thumb|150px|Hippolyta as she appears from the 1987 reboot until 2011's ''[[The New 52]]''. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]] (2002).]]\n\n====Origin====\nHippolyta's origins underwent a revision after writer [[George P\u00e9rez]]' revamp of Wonder Woman in 1987. In that continuity, Hippolyta and the rest of the [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscirian]] Amazons were created by a select group of the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian gods]], which included [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]] and [[Aphrodite]]. These goddesses reincarnated the souls of women gathered by the earth-goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] (women who had been slain by man's ignorance and fear). They sent these souls (Hippolyta's original incarnation was a pregnant cavewoman slain circa 32,000 BCE) to the bottom of the [[Aegean Sea]]. The souls then began to merge with the clay on the sea bed. The first reincarnated Amazon to break the surface was Hippolyta, and thus she was titled as Queen of the new race; in this version Hippolyta stood 5'9\", weighed approximately 130&nbsp;lbs, had curly black hair and more. The second Amazon to break the surface was her sister [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]] and she ruled at Hippolyta's side. Each of the goddesses then blessed the Amazon nation with gifts: hunting skills (Artemis), wisdom (Athena), warm homes (Hestia), plentiful harvests (Demeter), and beauty inside and out (Aphrodite). As a symbol of their responsibilities, the goddesses gave Hippolyta and Antiope each a [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]]. The Amazons eventually founded the city of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in [[Anatolia]] and became known as fierce warriors of peace in [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]].\n\n====Heracles====\nThe jealous and vengeful god [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] tried to drive a wedge between Amazons and other civilizations by influencing his half-brother, the demi-god [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]] to challenge the Amazons. When Heracles first approached the Amazons seeking battle, Hippolyta met him outside the city gates and tried to employ peaceful negotiations. When this did not work, Heracles attacked the Amazon Queen. Hippolyta easily turned the tables on him by using her wisdom and battle skills to subdue him. Still wishing peace, Hippolyta invited Heracles and his men into their city to celebrate a potential friendship with a feast. Heracles seemingly accepted the invitation.\n\nOnce in their city, Heracles and his men drugged the Amazons' wine and took them prisoner. After the theft of Hippolyta's Golden Girdle and abuse and rape of the Amazons, Hippolyta cried out to Athena to help them escape their bonds. Athena said that she would only aid them on the condition that the Amazons not seek retribution against Heracles and his men as that would be beneath the ideals of the Amazons. Hippolyta agreed and her bonds were broken. Hippolyta freed the other Amazons. The Amazons, however, were filled with hate and the desire for revenge. Breaking Hippolyta's oath to Athena, the Amazons began slaughtering their captors, (Heracles and his general [[Theseus]] had left).\n\nAfter they had killed all the men keeping them prisoners, [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]] renounced all ties to the Olympian gods and said goodbye to her sister Hippolyta, giving Hippolyta her Golden Girdle of Gaea to replace the one stolen by Heracles. She left to pursue vengeance, intending to kill Heracles and Theseus. Antiope's tribe later became the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]].\n\n====Godly penance====\nHippolyta and the remaining faithful Amazons then went to the sea shore where [[Athena]] told them their punishment for betraying their ideals. They were to be given immortality so that they could forever safeguard a doorway to a place of unspeakable evil. The doorway was on a far-off isolated island and it took months to get there. To guide their way, the god [[Poseidon]] cleared a pathway for them across the seas. Once they arrived, the Amazons created a new city and named their new home Themyscira, after their previous fallen city. The Amazons continued to live on the island guarding this \"Doom's Doorway\" (later shown to also lead to other places such as parts of Hades) and paying homage to their gods for three-thousand years.\n\n====Diana's birth====\nHippolyta began to ache for something unknown. She was told by the oracle [[Menalippe]] that the yearning she felt was for her unborn daughter. She was instructed to go to the beach and form a figure of an infant out of the island's clay. The original five goddesses, plus Hermes, united to incarnate and bless this final soul. They imbued it with many gifts and merged it with the clay form and, just as with the previous Amazons, the clay was changed into flesh and blood. Hippolyta named the child Diana, after a \"great and holy warrior,\" a stranger who had washed ashore on the island and died helping the Amazons defeat [[Hecatoncheires|Cottus]], a creature escaping Doom's Doorway. This Diana was later revealed to be the mother of Steve Trevor, who as a pilot had crashed near the island in the 1940s.\n\n====Return of Heracles====\nDuring Diana's ''[[Challenge of the Gods (comics)|Challenge of the Gods]]'' storyline,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #10-11 (November\u2013December 1987)</ref><ref name=ww12>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #12 (January 1988)</ref><ref name=ww13>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #13 (February 1988)</ref> she discovered that Heracles was transformed into a colossal stone pillar within Doom's Doorway, and was supporting Themyscira's weight for several millennia.<ref name=ww12/> In this state he was tormented and scarred by various mythological creatures, feeling the pain inflicted by them but not being able to do anything about it (much like [[Prometheus]]).<ref name=ww13/> This was the punishment given to him for his past transgressions. Thanks to Diana, Hippolyta, and the Lasso of Truth, he was restored to his original form and begged the Amazons for forgiveness.  Though some of the Amazons still harbored anger for their past humiliation, most of them were moved by Heracles' newfound humility, and Queen Hippolyta asked her people to search their hearts for the strength to forgive, which they almost immediately did. Doing so herself, Hippolyta not only forgave Heracles, but shared a brief kiss with him before he left the mortal realm to return to his father in Olympus.<ref name=ww14>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #14 (March 1988)</ref>\n\n====Return to the outside world====\nAfter Diana's completion of her challenge, the Amazons were released from their punishment by the Olympian gods. They were free to live out their lives any way they saw fit while retaining their immortality.<ref name=ww14 /> To celebrate, Hippolyta declared that Themyscira would finally create cultural exchange with the outside world. Diana became Themyscira's ambassador to the U.N.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #37-40 (December 1989 - March 1990))</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #50 (January 1991)</ref>\n\nIn spreading the Amazon ideals of love and peace, Diana made a powerful enemy, the sorceress [[Circe (comics)|Circe]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #17-19 (June\u2013August 1988)</ref> One of Circe's attacks on Diana involved the brainwashing of Hippolyta, transforming her into the second [[Shim'Tar]], or chief warrior, of the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #60 (November 1991)</ref><ref>''War of the Gods'' #3 (November 1991)</ref> In this persona, Hippolyta attacked Diana, and was defeated by a ricochet from Diana's bracelets.\n\nCirce considered all Amazons to be her enemy and later made a new plan for revenge. She teleported the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall to Themyscira on the pretense that they were to take the island. While the two groups fought, Circe teleported the island to a dimension of demons. There the two groups of Amazons were forced to put aside their rivalry in order to stave off the demons' attacks. The Amazons remained in the demon dimension until Diana discovered what had happened and forced Circe to return the island back to its rightful dimension.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #89 (August 1994)</ref> They found upon their return that although their time in the demon dimension lasted several years, the time passed in our dimension was only a few months.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #90 (september 1994)</ref>\n\nIn this time the Themyscirian and Bana-Mighdallian Amazons made an uneasy truce. The Themyscirians would live in the city while the Bana-Mighdallians would form their own settlement on the opposite side of the island. In Hippolyta's mind she still served as Queen over all Amazons on the island, but the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons did not see it as such and tensions between the two tribes remained.<ref name=ww168>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #168 (May 2001)</ref>\n\n====Motherly deception====\nBecause the demon dimension they were in was magic based, Hippolyta began to receive dreams and visions of the future. In one such dream she foresaw Wonder Woman's death. Fearful for her daughter's welfare, she put into motion a plan to remove Diana from her role as Wonder Woman and replace the title of Themyscira's Champion to another Amazon. Thus a new Contest for the title was made though she kept her true reasons for calling the new Contest to herself alone. Initially Hippolyta thought the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall were not worthy to enter the Contest but when Diana, angered at her mother's treatment of the new Amazons, called a vote on the whole to see if her people also agreed that they should be allowed to participate, the answer was yes. Suddenly inspired, Hippolyta noticed that the Bana-Mighdallian's most likely warrior to win was the Amazon [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]]. Hippolyta then in secret went to the Themyscirian Amazon mystic Magala. She had Magala transfer half of Diana's gods-given powers over to Artemis in order for Artemis' victory to be better equipped.<ref name=ww124>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #124 (August 1997)</ref> Hippolyta also provided many additional obstacles for Diana to encounter during her Contest trials in order for her to become sidetracked from the goal of winning. Due to her actions, Artemis became the Contest's winner and the new champion Wonder Woman. Later when Diana began to receive visions of the past she confronted her mother on why she really called for a new Contest. When Hippolyta told her she and Diana's relationship became scarred as Diana never truly forgave her mother for knowingly sending another Amazon to her death.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #90, 0, 91-99 (September 1994 - July 1995)</ref>\n\n====Wonder Woman====\nAfter Artemis was killed in battle the title of Wonder Woman was returned to Diana. This sent Hippolyta into a deep depression as she realized she was the cause of an innocent's death. Hippolyta gave command to the Amazon General [[Philippus (fictional character)|Philippus]] and went into self-imposed banishment.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #104 (December 1995)</ref>\n\nHippolyta boarded a small boat and let it cast adrift.

Whereas Diana used the Lasso of Truth as her primary weapon, Hippolyta favored a broad sword and wore a short blue skirt instead of briefs.\n\nJohn Byrne, the writer that introduced the concept of Hippolyta as the first Wonder Woman, has explained his intentions in a post in his message board:\n<blockquote>''I thought George's one \"mistake\" in rebooting Wonder Woman was making her only 25 years old when she left Paradise Island. I preferred the idea of a Diana who was thousands of years old (as, if I recall correctly, she was in the TV series). From that angle, I would have liked to have seen Diana having been Wonder Woman in WW2, and be returning to our world in the reboot.''</blockquote>\n<blockquote>''Not having that option, I took the next best course, and had Hippolyta fill that role.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=17792 |title=Wonder Woman revisited |publisher=Byrne Robotics |date= |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Wonder Woman, Queen Hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with [[Jay Garrick]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #130-133 (February\u2013May 1998)</ref> After this mission, she elected to join the [[Justice Society of America]] and remained in that era for eight years, where her teammates nicknamed her \"Polly\". During that time she had a relationship with [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted Grant]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #185 (November 2002)</ref> Hippolyta also made visits into the past to see her godchild [[Fury (DC Comics)|Lyta]], daughter of Hippolyta's protege Helena, the Golden Age Fury.{{Issue|date=February 2008}} These visits happened yearly from young Lyta's perspective and also accounted for Hippolyta's participation in the JSA/JLA team ups. When she returned from the past, Hippolyta took Diana's place in the [[Justice League|JLA]] as well.<ref>''JLA'' #18-23 (May\u2013October 1998)</ref><ref>''JLA'' #30 (June 1999)</ref>\n\nEventually Diana gave up her godhood and returned to her role as Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #136 (August 1998)</ref> Still clinging to her newfound sense of freedom, Hippolyta did not wish to relinquish her title as Wonder Woman (even though she admitted her daughter looked \"better in a bathing suit\" than she did), leaving two different Wonder Women acting in the same role at the same time. Diana was often unhappy with Hippolyta's continued role as Wonder Woman as she felt Hippolyta was ignoring her ''true'' duties as ruler of Themyscira, thus further inciting the antagonism between mother and daughter.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #171 (August 2001)</ref>\n\nAround this time Hippolyta discovered that the hero [[Donna Troy]] was actually a mirror image of her daughter Diana, brought to life through Themyscirian sorceries. Though Hippolyta had met Donna on previous adventures, when the two women met again after learning this fact, Hippolyta accepted Donna as a second daughter and held a coronation on the island, proclaiming Donna to be the second Amazon princess and an heir to the Themyscirian throne.<ref>''Wonder Woman Secret Files and Origins'' #3 (May 2002)</ref>\n\nOn one visit to the island, Diana discovered that the two tribes of Amazons were on the verge of a civil war due to unresolved issues and mysterious acts of sabotage made on the Bana-Mighdallian's construction of their city. When both Diana and Donna confronted Hippolyta about her inaction of rule at such a dangerous time, Hippolyta became very upset with her two daughters and told them that she intended to continue her role as Wonder Woman in the outside world and that Diana and Donna were to rule the island in her absence. Unfortunately the civil war took place after all and many Amazons on both sides were killed. Returning to the island, Hippolyta and Diana agreed to denounce their royal titles in order for both Amazon tribes to have an opportunity for peace, having both tribes gain equal footing in united rule.<ref name=ww169>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #169 (June 2001)</ref><ref name=ww168/>\n\n====Death====\nHippolyta continued to establish a distinguished [[career]] as Wonder Woman. The Queen enjoyed her role in the Justice Society and became accustomed to life in the [[United States]]. Mother and daughter fought on several occasions over Hippolyta's past expected roles \u2014 hero or queen \u2014 and their differences were unresolved when the queen sacrificed herself to save the [[Earth]] from [[Imperiex]] during the Imperiex War featured in ''[[Our Worlds at War]]''.<ref name=ww172>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #172 (September 2001)</ref> Ironically Hippolyta died at the birthplace of the Amazons, near the [[Aegean Sea]] in [[Greece]]. However she was allowed to see her daughter one last time and say goodbye. She, the spirit of her sister Antiope, and [[Steve Trevor]]'s mother Diana Rockwell Trevor became ghostly guardians of the island watching over both tribes as their distant and former queens.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #188 (March 2003)</ref>\n\n====One Year Later====\nAs part of the ''[[Amazons Attack!|Amazons Attack]]'' storyline, the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] revived Hippolyta and showed her that the U.S. government illegally kidnapped her daughter Diana.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #8 (June 2007)</ref> She was being tortured until she gave over the plans on how the U.S. government could create their own [[Purple Ray]] to be used as a weapon.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #7 (June 2007)</ref> Angered over this, Hippolyta resumed leadership of the Amazons and had them attack the city of [[Washington, D.C.]] in the hopes of rescuing Diana and serving their own form of justice against the world for their actions. They are shown using winged steeds, and other mythical creatures. During battle Hippolyta discovered that Circe had secretly planned to detonate a [[nuclear weapon]] on Themyscira and gained her revenge on the traitor by impaling the sorceress with a battle spear through the chest. Wonder Woman has an opportunity to kill her mother but does not take it, instead giving the knife to Hippolyta, who will not kill her daughter. Despite the fact that Circe is supposedly dead, Hippolyta seems fully intent on continuing her assault on the United States, even issuing an attack on other locations, including Kansas. Her more chaotic and malicious actions start to concern her Amazon generals. It is later learned that Circe used a portion of her own soul to revive Hippolyta from death. Because of this Hippolyta's persona was tainted by the witch's evil and thus Hippolyta is now a more blood-thirsty being than before.<ref>''Amazons Attack!'' #1-6 (June\u2013October 2007)</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the war all of the Amazons are given false identities and scattered throughout the world.<ref>''Amazons Attack!'' #6 (October 2007)</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #12 (October 2007)</ref> Hippolyta is spared but is banished to live alone on Themyscira, by what appears to be Athena but is later revealed to be the villainous [[Granny Goodness]], who along with the other [[New Gods]] of [[Apokolips]] have imprisoned the Greek deities. In ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', Hippolyta lives in hiding from Granny Goodness and her new brand of Amazons, human recruits being trained as a new generation of her [[Female Furies]]. With the help of island castaways [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] (briefly known as Catwoman), [[Harley Quinn]] and a powerless [[Mary Marvel]], Hippolyta is able to drive Granny out of Thermiscyra and back to Apokolips. After the Greek Gods are freed by Mary, Granny [[Death of the New Gods|is murdered by the mysterious Godkiller]], leaving Hippolyta once more as the Queen of Themyscira.\n\n====The Circle====\nDuring her isolation Hippolyta travels to the four corners of Themyscira, speaking to an Amazon prisoner at each point, asking them if they repent, to which each prisoner replies, \"Never\". However, the fourth and last prisoner, whom Hippolyta identifies as Alkyone, presents her with a wooden tiara with the words \"Our Queen\" across it similar to the one she and Diana both wore as Wonder Woman. Alkyone tells Hippolyta since she denied her the use of any blades, she gnawed in the inscription with her teeth. She goes on to accuse Hippolyta of betrayal for birthing \"The Dragon\", which clearly is a reference to Diana. Alkyone begs her to kill Diana and let them be a tribe again, but Hippolyta adamantly refuses. Alkyone then tells Hippolyta to tell Diana the truth, but again Hippolyta refuses and breaks the wooden tiara in half. As she leaves, Alkyone vows to save Hippolyta and make them a tribe again by killing Diana.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #14 (January 2008)</ref>\n\nAlkyone's past reveals her to have been a member of Hippolyta's Royal Guard along with three other Amazons\u2014Myrto, Charis and Philomela, charged with her personal protection.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #15 (February 2008)</ref> They were viewed as too brutal-minded and overzealous by General [[Philippus (fictional character)|Philippus]], captain of the General Amazon Guard, a viewpoint that was later proven when Alkyone learned that Hippolyta desired a child. This came to a head when Alkyone learned from the Amazon sorceress, Magala that another Amazon named Gennes had supposedly given birth to a daughter. But it turned out the baby was nothing more than a clay doll carved in the image of a child. Concluding Gennes had gone mad, Alkyone ordered that no such dolls were ever to be crafted on Themyscira again. After that, she ordered Gennes to be killed. In the present day, the army of [[Captain Nazi]] lands on Themyscira, intending to claim it for themselves. Alerted to their arrival, Hippolyta cuts her hair and readies herself for battle and vows to redeem herself for all the mistakes she has made since her resurrection. Elsewhere on the island, Alkyone offers her help and the rest of the former Royal Guard to the soldiers in hunting down Hippolyta in exchange for their release.\n\n====Wonder Woman \u2013 The Movie====\nIn ''Wonder Woman'' issues 24 and 25, there is a movie being made about Diana. In the beginning of issue 24, Diana brings [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Thomas Andrew Tresser]] home to meet her mother, Queen Hippolyta. Hippolyta takes Tresser and leaves Diana alone on the beach. This is her opportunity to get to know the man in whom her daughter has become interested. The getting to know him phase includes taking Tom to the Royal Menagerie to hand feed Griffins of Myth. While there Hippolyta asks rather directly if he and Diana have made love yet. Flustered he is able to honestly answer that they haven't. She asks Tom, \"Will you protect her, keep her from harm, if you are able?\" He replies, \"Yes. That I can promise. Although it usually goes the other way 'round, to be blunt.\" Before he leaves she gives him a spear she has made, grants him the title Sir Thomas of Cleveland, and makes him a guardsman of Themyscira. As Diana and Tom prepare to leave she requests one thing of her new guardsman, babies. As many as he and Diana can create as quickly as they can create them. As they leave the island Alkyone is seen watching them from shore as they float away on a giant shell.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (November\u2013December 2008)</ref>\n\n====Past Imperfect====\nFollowing the events of ''Wonder Woman'' #600, the timeline is altered by the Greek Gods and Hippolyta's history is radically changed once again. Here, Themyscira is invaded by a heavily armed paramilitary group while Diana is still a child, and the majority of the Amazons are wiped out in the ensuing battle. Hippolyta is able to save Diana by entrusting her to several of her servants, who smuggle the child to the United States in the midst of the attack, but Hippolyta herself is ultimately captured by the enemy soldiers. After being bound and presented to the leader of the invaders, Hippolyta commits suicide by throwing herself into a massive fire being used to incinerate the dead Amazons, choosing to die rather than submit to her captors.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #601 (September 2010)</ref> After Wonder Woman's exile in the altered continuity is reversed, Hippolyta is briefly restored to her Modern Age origins,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #614 (October 2011)</ref> greeting her daughter back and approving the changes she had done to her attitude and appearance during her ordeal.\n\n====The New 52====\n[[File:Hippolyta New 52 Look.jpg|thumb|upright|New 52 version of Hippolyta, from ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #2 (December 2011). Art by [[Cliff Chiang]].]]\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Hippolyta receives another major change. Now looking like the Silver Age Hippolyta, youthful and blonde, she retains her edgy, [[women warriors in literature and culture|warrior woman]] attitude. Furthermore, this incarnation of Hippolyta didn't fashion Diana from clay: instead, she bore her daughter from a relationship with Zeus, concocting a lie to protect Diana from Hera's rage.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #3 (January 2012)</ref>\n\nAfter the truth about Diana's birth is revealed, Hera, the queen of the Greek gods, appears on Paradise Island to punish Hippolyta (not for having an affair with her husband, but for having been too weak to resist Zeus' seduction). Hippolyta had predicted this, and asks Hera to take her life in exchange of letting Diana live. However, Hera changes her mind at the last second, and instead of killing Hippolyta, turns her into stone and the rest of the Amazons, minus Diana, into snakes, thus destroying Wonder Woman's home and her only family.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #4 (February 2012)</ref>\n\n====DC Rebirth====\nDuring the 2016 relaunch [[DC Rebirth]], Hippolyta once again goes through a major change. In the \"Year One\" storyline Hippolyta is presented like the Golden Age version with black hair and has a peaceful demeanor. When Steve Trevor lands on the island and is the only survivor of the soldiers, she seeks to have him sent home safely by hosting a competition to determine which Amazon is worthy. She quickly realizes her daughter will be the one to win, something that saddens her since leaving the island forsakes an Amazon's right to return. However, she is nevertheless proud when Diana does indeed win, and they bid each other goodbye.\n\nIn the story arc \"The Lies\" Wonder Woman and Steve seemingly return to Themyscira to find Hippolyta (the New 52 one) and the Amazons safe and sound, despite Wonder Woman remembering her apparent demise. Hippolyta does not understand what she means and only seems suspicious of Steve, telling Diana not to let him wander around alone. However, Diana and Steve begin to notice the inconsistencies: the Amazons are not familiar, they speak English instead of their ancient language, and their architecture has changed. Diana realizes this is because what she thought to be true was a lie: she never returned to Themyscira when she left years before, so the New 52 Hippolyta was an illusion.\n\nIn the present day, Hippolyta and the Amazons take notice of a strange tree growing on the island that serves as a bad omen of events to come. Any attempts to cut down the tree are futile, and Hippolyta worries Diana is in danger. She and her fellow Amazons go to the tree and combat Deimos and Phobos, Ares' sons in wolf-like forms before they are defeated on the other side by Diana. Hippolyta is briefly reunited with her daughter but unable to reach her, stating how proud she is of who Diana has become.\n\nIn the [[Watchmen]] sequel \"[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\" Hippolyta was told of her oracle's vision that Wonder Woman will be further injured in her fight with Black Adam during his attack on the United Nations. It was mentioned in a news report that the Amazons showed up during the battle and forcefully took Wonder Woman back to Themyscira.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #11. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHippolyta has 3,000 years of combat experience, providing her expertise in both hand-to-hand combat as well as with hand-held weapons. As a Themyscirian Amazon she is ageless and immortal,  allowing her to live indefinitely without physically aging beyond her youthful prime, but is still vulnerable to death upon sufficient injuries and such.<ref name=ww172/><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1987)</ref> She also possesses enhanced strength and intelligence. As shown by fellow members of her tribe, she has the capability to break apart steel and concrete with her bare hands,<ref name=ww169/><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #59 (October 1991)</ref> jump over 25 feet from a standing position,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #57 (August 1991)</ref> has a high durability factor,<ref>''Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (October 2001)</ref> enhanced healing,<ref name=ww30>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #30 (May 1989)</ref> and the ability to absorb and process a vast amount of knowledge in a short period of time.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #3 (April 1987)</ref>\n\nHippolyta, also in addition to all the Themyscirian Amazons, possesses the ability to relieve her body of physical injury and toxins by becoming one with the Earth's soil and then reforming her body whole again.<ref name=ww30 /> The first time Diana does this she prays to her god [[Gaia (DC Comics)|Gaea]] saying: \"''Gaea, I pray to you. Grant me your strength. You are the Earth who suckled me, who nurtured and bred me. Through you all life is renewed. The circle which never ends. I pray you, mother Gaea, take me into your bosom. Please, let me be worthy.''\" During writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s time on the comic it was stated that this is a very sacred ritual to the Themyscirians, only to be used in the most dire of circumstances.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #120 (April 1997)</ref>\n\nAs an Amazon, Hippolyta had access to a number of magical artifacts. These artifacts included the Gauntlet of Atlas, which greatly increased her overall strength and durability, as well as the Sandals of Hermes, which increased her speed and allowed her to fly. During her time as Wonder Woman, Hippolyta wielded the Lasso of Truth, though she seemed to prefer a broadsword and shield in combat. Her broadsword was created by Hephaestus and was sharp enough to slice the electrons off of an atom.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Hippolyta encourages [[Aquaman]] of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] to marry her daughter, [[Wonder Woman]], after she had been poisoned by a [[Kraken]]. On the wedding day, however, Hippolyta was murdered by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] in disguise as an Atlantean, who in an act of betrayal, was working with [[Ocean Master]]. Diana was actually the target, but Hippolyta took the arrow. This leads to war between the Amazons and Atlanteans.<ref>''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the prequel comic to the video game, Hippolyta first appears in Year Two to take her comatose daughter Diana back to Themyscira with the hope that she will be healed. In Year Three, when Diana does not awake even after physically healing, she makes a deal with Hera to awaken Diana if she agrees to an eventual favor. Hera calls upon the favor in Year Four when she orders Hippolyta to lead the Amazons on an attack on Superman and his Regime. Hippolyta is reluctant since Diana is a part of the Regime, and when she refuses she is imprisoned by Hera and Zeus. Eventually she is sent to Tartarus with Harley Quinn and Billy Batson (Shazam), though Harley breaks them out with the use of a Kryptonian super pill and her own bizarre behavior. They are confronted by Ares, though they get away because of a Mother Box. They are then confronted by Darkseid, who imprisons them and reveals that he is aligned with Ares. Superman appears and frees them, leaving them open to flee with the Mother Box to the Himalayas, where they are met by Wonder Woman and Batman. She later joins her daughter in combating the Greek Gods, though the threat of a nuclear bomb stops the fighting. Once Diana takes care of it the New God Highfather intervenes and convinces Zeus and the other gods to leave Earth alone; they agree with the promise of severing all ties, including with the Amazons. In the beginning of Year Five Hippolyta comforts a guilt-ridden Diana and reveals her knowledge of how Diana has romantic feelings for Superman. She encourages her to stand by his side.\n\nIn the sequel comic ''Injustice 2'', the Regime has been overthrown and Diana imprisoned on Themyscira for her actions. Now aware of the full extent of the Regime's tyrannical behavior, Hippolyta tries to convince her daughter her ways are wrong, but Diana rebuffs Hippolyta as being a coward for never trying to better man's world herself. When Kara Zor-El washes ashore the island with the intent of rescuing Diana, Hippolyta is betrayed by a few Amazons who believe in Diana's view and aid in the rescue.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live action====\n[[File:TVQueenHippolyte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cloris Leachman]] as Queen Hippolyta on the ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' series.]]\n* In 1974, the [[Wonder Woman (1974 film)|pilot for Wonder Woman]] was broadcast, with [[Charlene Holt]] cast as Hippolyta. \n* In the 1975 ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' television series starring [[Lynda Carter]], three different actresses portrayed Queen Hippolyta: [[Cloris Leachman]] in ''The New Original Wonder Woman'' TV series [[The New Original Wonder Woman|pilot film]] (1975); [[Carolyn Jones]] in the episodes \"[[The Feminum Mystique]]\" parts 1 and 2 and \"[[Wonder Woman in Hollywood]]\"; and [[Beatrice Straight]] in the episodes \"[[The Return of Wonder Woman]]\" and \"[[The Bermuda Triangle Crisis]]\". The character was never referred to as Queen Hippolyta by name. Wonder Woman and Wonder Girl refer to her as \"Mother\" and the Amazons either refer to her as \"Your Majesty\" or \"The Queen\".\n* An allusion to Hippolyta is made in [[The WB]] television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''. In the 2004 [[Smallville (season 3)|season three]] episode \"[[Asylum (Smallville)|Asylum]]\", a newspaper includes the headline stating: \"Themyscirian Queen Addresses the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]\". Hippolyta is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 1978, an animated Queen Hippolyta was shown on ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' in the episodes \"Secret Origins of the Super Friends\" and \"Super Friends: Rest in Peace\". Queen Hippolyta also appears in the 1980 ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' episode \"Return of Atlantis\". Hippolyta is a brunette in her first two appearances, but is blonde in the third. In that series, Wonder Woman addresses Hippolyta by name rather than \"Mother\".\n* A brunette Queen Hippolyta in the 1988 ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' cartoon episode \"[[Superman and Wonder Woman versus the Sorceress of Time]]\" voiced by [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]. She is attacked by the Sorceress of Time, and herself and the other Amazons are shrunk down to midget size and imprisoned, whereupon she implores Wonder Woman to seek the aid of Superman in battling the Sorceress to reverse this.\n* Hippolyta appears in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:\n** In 2001, Hippolyta was depicted in the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', voiced by actress [[Susan Sullivan]].<ref name=\"Voice\">{{cite web |publisher=BehindtheVoiceActors.com |url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Wonder-Woman/Hippolyta/ |title=Voices of Hippolyta |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> Hippolyta appeared in the episodes \"[[Secret Origins (Justice League episode)|Secret Origins]]\", \"[[Paradise Lost (Justice League episode)|Paradise Lost]]\", \"[[Fury (Justice League episode)|Fury]]\", and \"[[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|Hereafter]]\". While Diana believes that Hippolyta molded her from clay and breathed mystic life into her, Hades says that they molded her together, suggesting that Hades is really Diana's father. Putting her religion and devotion to the [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Olympian Gods]] above all, she reluctantly exiles her daughter Diana from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]] rather than risk incurring divine wrath, when Diana brings out-worlders (the Justice League) to Themyscira in \"Paradise Lost\". In this series, it is explained that the Wonder Woman uniform was actually made by the god [[Hephaestus]] for Queen Hippolyta to use (but he cheekily comments that the uniform looks better on Diana). In the episode \"Fury\", Hawkgirl visits Themyscira to get information about Aresia from Hippolyta. A flashback revealed that Aresia's ship was attacked by pirates where she was the only survivor. While riding a horse on the beach, Hippolyta found Aresia's body and the dying captain where Hippolyta buried him in secret. In the present, Aresia captures Hippolyta as her plans to wipe out men goes into its next stage. When Aresia perishes in the plane crash, Hippolyta mourned Aresia's death. Hippolyta is seen comforting Diana following Superman's supposed death in the episode \"Hereafter\".\n** Hippolyta appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"[[The Balance (Justice League Unlimited)|The Balance]]\", voiced again by Susan Sullivan.<ref name=\"Voice\"/> Upon seeing the message that Hermes gave Wonder Woman, Hippolyta lifts the exile she put on her daughter as well as informing her of her full power.

As the Joker approaches the throne to claim his prize, he removes his disguise and knocks both Diana and Hippolyta unconscious before fleeing the island with Diana as his captive. What happened to Hippolyta after this is not stated.\n* Hippolyta appears in the series ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode \"[[Luthor in Paradise]]\", voiced by [[Julianne Grossman]].<ref name=\"Voice\"/> It is mentioned that her staff is a key to the Forbidden Realm where the Oculus of the ''Argo'' is held that can grant anyone the powers of Zeus, and that artifact was entrusted to Hippolyta by Hera. She is present when Lex Luthor and Circe invade Themyscira in order to obtain a staff that would take them to the Forbidden Realm, where they defeat Hippolyta. After Lex Luthor and Circe are apprehended, Hippolyta has Circe imprisoned in Tartarus. Upon thanking Batman and Superman for helping her daughter and stopping the villains, Hippolyta advises Batman and Superman to get off Themyscira before her soldiers filet them.\n* Hippolyta appears on the 2019 animated series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' voiced by [[Cree Summer]].\n\n===Film===\n====Animation====\n* Actress [[Charlene Holt]] portrayed Queen Hippolyta in the 1974 TV movie ''[[Wonder Woman (1974 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' starring [[Cathy Lee Crosby]].\n* Hippolyta appears in the direct-to-DVD animated movie ''[[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|Wonder Woman]]''. She is voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]].<ref name=\"Voice\"/> Like Cloris Leachman's portrayal in the 1975 TV film, after she learns that Diana had undergone the challenge and won it against her prohibition, she accepts the result without argument. Similarly to her previous animated incarnation, this version of Hippolyta also became romantically involved with a Greek god\u2014Ares, the god of war\u2014whom she imprisoned after she was betrayed by him. She is the mother of Ares' son, Thrax.\n* Hippolyta appeared in the 2016 direct-to-DVD animated film ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Hero of the Year]]'' voiced by Julianne Grossman.<ref name=\"Voice\"/> Grossman reprised her role on the [[DC Super Hero Girls|web series]], ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games|Intergalactic Games]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls: Legends of Atlantis|Legends of Atlantis]]'', and the Lego shorts.\n* Hippolyta appears in the 2019 animated film ''[[Wonder Woman: Bloodlines]]'', voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. This version is far more hardline than other versions, as she refused to allow Steve Trevor to return home and even disowned Diana when she chose to leave Paradise Island with him. By the end of the film, they do reconcile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-bloodlines-synopsis-art-cast/amp/|title=Wonder Woman Bloodlines Gets Synopsis, Art, Voice Cast|website=comicbookresources|date=July 29, 2019|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====DC Extended Universe====\n{{Main|DC Extended Universe}} {{See also|Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Justice League (film)|Wonder Woman 1984}}\n[[Connie Nielsen]] portrays Hippolyta in several films set in the DC Extended Universe.<ref name=\"EW 2016-03\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/wonder-woman-first-look-gal-gadot-robin-wright-connie-nielsen |title=''Wonder Woman'': Gal Gadot, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen first look |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref> \n*She makes her debut in the 2017 ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' film.

Written by [[Hank Chapman]],\n\n{{quote|\"Atrocity Story\" is not really a story at all, but rather a body of exposition in narrative form conveying information.... Chapman starts off with screaming headlines of brutal Communist atrocities done to U.S. and U.N. troops and unarmed civilians. He then draws comparisons to Nazi atrocities perpetrated by the Third Reich.... Paul Reinman renders this broadcast in newsreel fashion starting off with a magnificent full-page splash depicting a score of inhumanly bound and slaughtered U.S. Marines. The tempo picks up and using smaller and smaller panels, Reinman displays one atrocity after another. The panel-to-panel progression is swift and Reinman's art is crisp and starkly grim with dark shadowing in the inks. Page 5 is a disturbing eight-panel review of the atrocities on the Nazi concentration camps depicting dead camp victims and riveting single panels of hollow-eyed, skeletal survivors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://timely-atlas-comics.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-history-of-atlas-war-comics-1950-1960.html | first= Michael J. | last=Vassallo | publisher = Timely-Atlas-Comics | date= May 4, 2013 | accessdate = September 9, 2013 | title =A History of Atlas War Comics (1950-1960) | archivedate= August 20, 2013 | url-status =  live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130820053454/http://timely-atlas-comics.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-history-of-atlas-war-comics-1950-1960.html}}</ref>}}\n\nWith the late-1950s return of comics legend [[Jack Kirby]] to [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], on the cusp of it becoming [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], Reinman became a frequent Kirby [[inker]] in such \"[[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|pre-superhero Marvel]]\" [[science-fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthologies]] as ''[[Strange Tales]]'' and ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', as well as on the espionage series ''[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]''.

Written by [[Hank Chapman]],\n\n{{quote|\"Atrocity Story\" is not really a story at all, but rather a body of exposition in narrative form conveying information.... Chapman starts off with screaming headlines of brutal Communist atrocities done to U.S. and U.N. troops and unarmed civilians. He then draws comparisons to Nazi atrocities perpetrated by the Third Reich.... Paul Reinman renders this broadcast in newsreel fashion starting off with a magnificent full-page splash depicting a score of inhumanly bound and slaughtered U.S. Marines. The tempo picks up and using smaller and smaller panels, Reinman displays one atrocity after another. The panel-to-panel progression is swift and Reinman's art is crisp and starkly grim with dark shadowing in the inks. Page 5 is a disturbing eight-panel review of the atrocities on the Nazi concentration camps depicting dead camp victims and riveting single panels of hollow-eyed, skeletal survivors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://timely-atlas-comics.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-history-of-atlas-war-comics-1950-1960.html | first= Michael J. | last=Vassallo | publisher = Timely-Atlas-Comics | date= May 4, 2013 | accessdate = September 9, 2013 | title =A History of Atlas War Comics (1950-1960) | archivedate= August 20, 2013 | url-status =  live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130820053454/http://timely-atlas-comics.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-history-of-atlas-war-comics-1950-1960.html}}</ref>}}\n\nWith the late-1950s return of comics legend [[Jack Kirby]] to [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], on the cusp of it becoming [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], Reinman became a frequent Kirby [[inker]] in such \"[[Atlas Comics (1950s)#Pre-superhero Marvel|pre-superhero Marvel]]\" [[science-fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthologies]] as ''[[Strange Tales]]'' and ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', as well as on the espionage series ''[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]''.

She has continued to appear through the mid-2000s, mainly as a supporting character in ''[[Justice Society of America]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn the original comics in the 1940s, Ma Hunkel is a working mother whose costume consists of [[long underwear|longjohns]] and a [[cooking pot]] on her head. She adopts the identity of the Red Tornado to fight local criminals in her [[New York City]] neighborhood, inspired by her son's admiration for the superhero [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]]. The character's popularity was such that she was given a cameo in the first adventure of the [[Justice Society of America]], visiting the JSA's headquarters but being forced by a humorous mishap, her pants splitting, to leave without having the chance to apply for membership. However, later Justice Society stories have declared Ma to be an honorary member of the team.\n\nMa was later joined by a pair of sidekicks known as the Cyclone Kids, consisting of her daughter Amelia \"Sisty\" Hunkel and neighbor Mortimer \"Dinky\" Jibbet (brother of boy cartoonist Scribbly, the star of the comic book feature in which the Red Tornado debuted).\n\nMa Hunkel returned in ''JSA'' #55 (February, 2004). This story reveals that Ma had been in the [[Witness Protection Program]] since 1950. Senior JSA members Green Lantern, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|the Flash]], [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] find Ma to tell her that she can come out of hiding, as the last member of the gang against whom she testified in 1950 has died. Ma subsequently becomes caretaker of the JSA's [[Manhattan]] museum/headquarters. She does not, however, resume her crimefighting activities as the Red Tornado.\n\nHer daughter and (now) son-in-law, the former Cyclone Kids, briefly have their own costumed adventures, starting in the title ''[[Young Justice]]''.

They only knew that this bulky figure in the red flannels, bedroom slippers, cape, and inverted stew pot could be counted on to tackle all sorts of criminals from the biggest to the smallest.\"<ref name=Goulart/>\n\nThe character reappeared in a three-page \"Scribbly\" story by Mayer in DC's ''Secret Origins'' #29 (Aug. 1986). She had a one-panel appearance in ''[[Animal Man]]'' \"Deus Ex Machine\", in a sort of limbo for characters who at the time weren't written into mainstream continuity.\n\nIn Alex Ross's classic 1996 graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', set in an [[Elseworlds|alternative DC future]], the \"Original Red Tornado\" is identified as Ma Hunkel: she can just be seen at the top-left hand side of the Justice League line-up which includes [[Superman]] and [[Norman McCay]]. In issue 3, (page 135 of the collected edition), panel 1, she can be seen on a balcony looking down at Superman and McCay and wearing a far more sophisticated, armour-like costume.\n\nShe appeared briefly in 1998's ''DC Universe Holiday Bash II'' special, in the story \"I Left My Heart at the Justice Society Canteen\", and in ''All-Star Comics 80-Page Giant'' #1 (Sept. 1999), in a story, \"Way of the Amazon\", in which Ma Hunkel takes valorous center stage amid [[Liberty Belle (comics)|Liberty Belle]], [[Phantom Lady]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. She has continued to appear through the mid-2000s, mainly as a supporting character in ''[[Justice Society of America]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn the original comics in the 1940s, Ma Hunkel is a working mother whose costume consists of [[long underwear|longjohns]] and a [[cooking pot]] on her head. She adopts the identity of the Red Tornado to fight local criminals in her [[New York City]] neighborhood, inspired by her son's admiration for the superhero [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]]. The character's popularity was such that she was given a cameo in the first adventure of the [[Justice Society of America]], visiting the JSA's headquarters but being forced by a humorous mishap, her pants splitting, to leave without having the chance to apply for membership. However, later Justice Society stories have declared Ma to be an honorary member of the team.\n\nMa was later joined by a pair of sidekicks known as the Cyclone Kids, consisting of her daughter Amelia \"Sisty\" Hunkel and neighbor Mortimer \"Dinky\" Jibbet (brother of boy cartoonist Scribbly, the star of the comic book feature in which the Red Tornado debuted).\n\nMa Hunkel returned in ''JSA'' #55 (February, 2004). This story reveals that Ma had been in the [[Witness Protection Program]] since 1950. Senior JSA members Green Lantern, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|the Flash]], [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] find Ma to tell her that she can come out of hiding, as the last member of the gang against whom she testified in 1950 has died. Ma subsequently becomes caretaker of the JSA's [[Manhattan]] museum/headquarters. She does not, however, resume her crimefighting activities as the Red Tornado.\n\nHer daughter and (now) son-in-law, the former Cyclone Kids, briefly have their own costumed adventures, starting in the title ''[[Young Justice]]''. They band together with other Golden Age sidekicks out of concern for the safety of younger superheroes.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Peter David|David, Peter]] |penciller=[[Todd Nauck|Nauck, Todd]] |inker=Stucker, Lary |letterer=[[Ken Lopez|Lopez, Ken]] |editor=[[Eddie Berganza|Berganza, Eddie]] |story=Aftermath |title=[[Young Justice]] |volume=1 |issue=16 |date=January 2000 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref>\n\nMa's wind-controlling granddaughter, [[Maxine Hunkel]], joins the JSA in ''Justice Society of America'' Vol. 3 #1 (February, 2007).

This character is younger and more svelte than the original version and appears to possess wind-based powers. It is unclear if this is a new version of Ma Hunkel.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIn her prime, Ma Hunkel was a surprisingly strong woman. Many who encountered her often believed that the Red Tornado was, in fact, a man, a notion that helped protect Ma's secret identity on more than one occasion. In the ensuing years, Ma Hunkel's strength level has diminished with age.\n\nMa Hunkel was also a great cook with an ability to feed a large group of people which included the Justice Society of America.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Kingdom Come''===\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' timeline, an older Ma Hunkel wielding a more sophisticated armor version of the Red Tornado costume joins the re-formed [[Justice League]] under [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]]<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] |artist=[[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]] |letterer=[[Todd Klein|Klein, Todd]] |editor=Kahan, Bob |story=Up in the Sky |title=[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=July 1996 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=New York, NY |page=}}</ref>, and appears '''[[Maxine Hunkel]]'''.

A full-length story, and Roy Thomas' last contribution to the series, excluding the Grim Ghost story in #42.\n* '''#32''' (November 1988): The [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In a full-length story by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Peter David]], the Justice League is formed by [[Green Lantern]] ([[Hal Jordan]]), the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], [[Aquaman]], the Martian Manhunter and the Black Canary. Superman and Batman were not founding members, and [[Wonder Woman]]'s revised continuity precluded her from the same. The events depicted were later expanded upon in ''JLA: Year One'' and ''JLA: Incarnations''.\n* '''#33''' (December 1988): [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] and [[Mister Miracle]].

It also included five pages of ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who]]'' entries on [[Bette Kane|Flamebird]], the [[Golden Eagle (comics)|Golden Eagle]], the [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], the [[Mal Duncan|Herald]], the Antithesis and the [[Mister Twister (comics)|Gargoyle]].\n* '''''Special'' #1''' (1989): the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Sam Kieth]], the [[Riddler]] by Neil Gaiman, [[Matt Wagner]] and [[Bernie Mireault]], and [[Two-Face]] by [[Mark Verheiden]] and [[Pat Broderick]].\n\nAdditionally, there was a belated ''Secret Origins 80-Page Giant'' issued in 1998 ({{ISBN|1-56389-440-8}}), that focused on the members of [[Young Justice]].\n\n==Collected edition==\nSome issues of the second series were collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] along with other material and some original work in 1989 called ''Secret Origins'', but the official title, as stated in the book's [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]], is given as ''Secret Origins of The World's Greatest Super-Heroes'' ({{ISBN|0930289501}}). The focus was on DC's major characters: origin of the Justice League of America (from #32), the Flash (Barry Allen, from ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2); Green Lantern (Hal Jordan, from #36); J'onn J'onnz, the Martian Manhunter (from #35); and Superman (from ''The Man of Steel'' #6). There was also an all-new retelling of Batman's origins, ''[[The Man Who Falls|Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', by Dennis O'Neil and [[Dick Giordano]]; this story later served as a cited inspiration for the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"genesis\">{{cite video | people=[[Dan DiDio|DiDio, Dan]] (Vice President of DC Comics), [[David S.

Much of this was changed in the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' crossover, Thomas himself would [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] this some months later in ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)#Captain Marvel in the late 1980s|SHAZAM! The New Beginning]]'', and all of which was changed again by Jerry Ordway in his [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]''.\n* '''#4''' (July 1986): [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] (Ronnie Raymond).\n* '''#5''' (August 1986): the original [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)|Crimson Avenger]]; art by [[Gene Colan]].\n* '''#6''' (September 1986): [[Halo (comics)|Halo]] of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]; the Golden Age [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]]. This was the first double-sized issue.\n* '''#7''' (October 1986): [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]]; the Golden Age [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]]\n* '''#8''' (November 1986): [[Shadow Lass]]; [[Doll Man]].\n* '''#9''' (December 1986): The original [[Star-Spangled Kid]] (Skyman) and [[Stripesy]]; the Golden Age [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]].\n* '''#10''' (January 1987): The [[Phantom Stranger]]. This was a ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' tie-in that related four possible origins for the character; one by Mike Barr and [[Jim Aparo]] was a variation on the [[Wandering Jew]] myth, while another by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Joe Orlando]] postulated that the Stranger was a fallen angel.\n* '''#11''' (February 1987): the Golden Age [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]]; [[Power Girl]]. Both stories presented have since been retconned, with Power Girl's backstory having been redefined by [[Geoff Johns]] in the pages of ''JSA Classified'', which served as part of the buildup to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.\n* '''#12''' (March 1987): The [[Challengers of the Unknown]]; [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]].\n* '''#13''' (April 1987): [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (art by [[Erik Larsen]]); [[Johnny Thunder#Original version|Johnny Thunder and his Thunderbolt]]; the Whip.\n* '''#14''' (May 1987): [[Suicide Squad]]. Another ''Legends'' tie-in, it served as a prequel to the later series and was written by that series' writer, [[John Ostrander]].\n* '''#15''' (June 1987): The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]; [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]].\n* '''#16''' (July 1987): [[Hourman]]; the [[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]; [['Mazing Man]].\n* '''#17''' (August 1987): [[Adam Strange]]; [[Doctor Occult]].\n* '''#18''' (September 1987): The Golden Age Green Lantern ([[Alan Scott]]); the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]].\n* '''#19''' (October 1987): [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]]; the [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]].\n* '''#20''' (November 1987): [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]; [[Doctor Mid-Nite]].\n* '''#21''' (December 1987): [[Jonah Hex]]; the [[Black Condor]].\n* '''#22''' (January 1988): the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]. This was a tie-in with ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' as was the subsequent issue, and aligned the various histories of the characters with the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] name together.\n* '''#23''' (February 1988): the [[Guardians of the Universe]] written by [[Todd Klein]]; the [[Floronic Man]] written by [[Rick Veitch]].\n* '''#24''' (March 1988): [[Doctor Fate]]; [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]. Mark Waid became editor beginning with this issue.\n* '''#25''' (April 1988): The [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] (now apocryphal); the Golden Age [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]].\n* '''#26''' (May 1988): [[Black Lightning]]; [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]].\n* '''#27''' (June 1988): [[Zatanna]], her father [[Zatara]], and [[Doctor Mist]].\n* '''#28''' (July 1988): [[Midnight (comics)|Midnight]] art by Gil Kane; [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]] art by [[Rob Liefeld]].  Nightshade's origin doubled as an introduction/backdrop to a three-issue ''Suicide Squad'' story arc where she returned to her place of origin to save her brother.\n* '''#29''' (August 1988): The [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]; the [[Red Tornado (Golden Age)|Red Tornado]] (Ma Hunkel; this was [[Sheldon Mayer]]'s last comic book story); [[Tex Thompson|Mr. America]] (a.k.a. the Americommando).\n* '''#30''' (September 1988): [[Plastic Man]]; the [[Elongated Man]].\n* '''#31''' (October 1988): The [[Justice Society of America]]. A full-length story, and Roy Thomas' last contribution to the series, excluding the Grim Ghost story in #42.\n* '''#32''' (November 1988): The [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In a full-length story by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Peter David]], the Justice League is formed by [[Green Lantern]] ([[Hal Jordan]]), the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], [[Aquaman]], the Martian Manhunter and the Black Canary. Superman and Batman were not founding members, and [[Wonder Woman]]'s revised continuity precluded her from the same. The events depicted were later expanded upon in ''JLA: Year One'' and ''JLA: Incarnations''.\n* '''#33''' (December 1988): [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] and [[Mister Miracle]]. This and the subsequent two issues dealt with the members of Justice League International.\n* '''#34''' (Winter 1988): [[Captain Atom]], [[G'nort]] and [[Rocket Red]].\n* '''#35''' (Holiday 1988): [[Booster Gold]], [[Maxwell Lord]], and the [[Martian Manhunter]] rendered apocryphal by events and revelations in J'onn J'onnz' later solo series.\n* '''#36''' (January 1989): Green Lantern ([[Hal Jordan]]) story by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Jim Owsley]]; [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] story by [[Neil Gaiman]].\n* '''#37''' (February 1989): The [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]]; the original [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]].\n* '''#38''' (March 1989): The [[Green Arrow]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]].\n* '''#39''' (April 1989): [[Animal Man]] story by [[Grant Morrison]]; the [[Man-Bat]].\n* '''#40''' (May 1989): The [[Gorillas in comics|all-gorilla]] issue, spotlighting [[Congorilla]], [[Detective Chimp]], and [[Gorilla Grodd]].\n* '''#41''' (June 1989): The [[Rogues (comics)|Flash's Rogues Gallery]] - the [[Weather Wizard]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], [[Captain Boomerang]], and [[Captain Cold]].\n* '''#42''' (July 1989): [[Phantom Girl]]; the [[Gay Ghost]]/Grim Ghost.\n* '''#43''' (August 1989): The original [[Hawk and Dove]]; [[Cave Carson]]; [[Chris KL-99]].\n* '''#44''' (September 1989): [[Clayface]] I, II, III and IV. This issue gave background information for a story arc that appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #604-607 entitled ''The Mud Pack''.\n* '''#45''' (October 1989): [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]; [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]].\n* '''#46''' (December 1989): The headquarters of the Silver Age Justice League of America (story by Grant Morrison), the New Titans' [[Titans Tower]], and the 'rocketship clubhouse' of the Legion of Super Heroes. Arm Fall Off Boy makes his first appearance.\n* '''#47''' (February 1990): Deceased Legionnaires [[Ferro Lad]], [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] and [[Chemical King]].\n* '''#48''' (April 1990): [[Ambush Bug]], [[Stanley and His Monster]], [[Rex the Wonder Dog]], and the [[Trigger Twins]].\n* '''#49''' (June 1990): [[Bouncing Boy]], the [[Newsboy Legion]], and the [[Silent Knight]].\n* '''#50''' (August 1990): a 96-page last issue. This consisted of a [[prose]] retelling of [[Robin (character)|Dick Grayson]]'s first encounter with Batman by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]]; the first meeting of the Golden and Silver Age [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]es story by Grant Morrison; how [[Johnny Thunder#Western version|Johnny Thunder (the western hero)]] came to be; the definitive history of the [[Black Canary]]; and the stories behind the [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] and the [[Space Museum (comics)|Space Museum]].\n\n===''Annual''s and ''Special''s===\n* '''''Annual'' #1''' (1987): the [[Doom Patrol]] art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]; [[Captain Comet]].\n* '''''Annual'' #2''' (1988): The second and third Flashes ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]]).\n* '''''Annual'' #3''' (1989): the [[Teen Titans]]. This was an anniversary tribute with contributions from [[George P\u00e9rez]], [[Tom Grummett]], [[Irv Novick]], [[Dave Cockrum]], [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] and [[Colleen Doran]]. It also included five pages of ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who]]'' entries on [[Bette Kane|Flamebird]], the [[Golden Eagle (comics)|Golden Eagle]], the [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], the [[Mal Duncan|Herald]], the Antithesis and the [[Mister Twister (comics)|Gargoyle]].\n* '''''Special'' #1''' (1989): the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Sam Kieth]], the [[Riddler]] by Neil Gaiman, [[Matt Wagner]] and [[Bernie Mireault]], and [[Two-Face]] by [[Mark Verheiden]] and [[Pat Broderick]].\n\nAdditionally, there was a belated ''Secret Origins 80-Page Giant'' issued in 1998 ({{ISBN|1-56389-440-8}}), that focused on the members of [[Young Justice]].\n\n==Collected edition==\nSome issues of the second series were collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] along with other material and some original work in 1989 called ''Secret Origins'', but the official title, as stated in the book's [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]], is given as ''Secret Origins of The World's Greatest Super-Heroes'' ({{ISBN|0930289501}}). The focus was on DC's major characters: origin of the Justice League of America (from #32), the Flash (Barry Allen, from ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2); Green Lantern (Hal Jordan, from #36); J'onn J'onnz, the Martian Manhunter (from #35); and Superman (from ''The Man of Steel'' #6). There was also an all-new retelling of Batman's origins, ''[[The Man Who Falls|Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', by Dennis O'Neil and [[Dick Giordano]]; this story later served as a cited inspiration for the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"genesis\">{{cite video | people=[[Dan DiDio|DiDio, Dan]] (Vice President of DC Comics), [[David S.

Wickersham moved the Third District court headquarters to [[Fairbanks]] in 1903.]]\n[[Image:James Wickersham and chiefs.jpg|thumb|Judge Wickersham (center) in council with Indian chiefs, Fairbanks, Alaska]]\n'''James Wickersham''' (August 24, 1857 \u2013 October 24, 1939) was a district [[Judge#United States|judge]] for [[Alaska]], appointed by U.S. President [[William McKinley]] to the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska|Third Judicial District]] in 1900. He resigned his post in 1908 and was subsequently elected as Alaska's delegate to [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]], serving until 1917 and then being re-elected in 1930. He was instrumental in the passage of the [[Organic Act]] of 1912, which granted Alaska territorial status, introduced the Alaska Railroad Bill, legislation to establish [[Denali National Park and Preserve|McKinley Park]], and the first [[Alaska Statehood Bill]] in 1916. He was among those responsible for the creation of the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, which later became the [[University of Alaska]]. A residence hall on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus is named in his honor.\n\nWickersham was born near [[Patoka, Illinois]] and moved in 1883 with his wife, Deborah, to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington Territory]], where he became a judge. While in Tacoma he helped lead a mob which forced the city's Chinese population out of town, and was later arrested as one of the \"Tacoma Twenty-Seven,\" though he was never convicted. He was a member of the Tacoma Academy of Science and was President of that organization in 1893.  He presented a paper to the Academy on 6 Feb, 1893, entitled, Is it Mount Tacoma, or Rainier?  During the presentation the \"following prominent Indians representing the Puyallup, Nesqually and Klickitat tribes were seated on the platform:  George Leschi, son of Quiemuth, a leader in the Indian war of 1855; Jack Simmons; John Hiaton, one of the patriarchs of the reservation, 80 years of age, and a signer of the treaty of 1854; Mrs. John Hiaton and John Powers\".  The presentation has been reproduced by a digital file created at the Library of Congress.<ref>Is it Mount Tacoma, or Rainier?  Originally published in Tacoma:  News Publishing Company 1893, reproduced by the Library of Congress from a digital file.</ref>\n\n==Arrival in Alaska==\nWhen Wickersham set off for Alaska he was allegedly dodging a government posting in Japan, and he told anyone who asked that he preferred the Eagle post, saying he \"yearned for the Yukon, not Yokohama\".<ref name=\"Wickersham2010\">{{cite book|last=Wickersham|first=James|title=Old Yukon: Tales, Trails, and Trials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiMTTcUb1x0C&pg=PR15|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2010-03-15|publisher=University of Alaska Press|isbn=9781602231139|pages=15\u2013}}</ref> With the introduction of federal oversight in the form of three district court judges, Wickersham being one of the two new appointees, his peers being [[Arthur H. Noyes]] in Nome and the previously established [[Melville C. Brown]] in Juneau, he was now one of the three most powerful people in Alaska, with no one within 3,000 miles to overrule his decisions or stand in his way. After the Nome Gold Conspiracy involving prominent Republican National Committee member [[Alexander McKenzie (politician)|Alexander McKenzie]], it was Wickersham they turned to clean up the legal mess left by then ousted Judge Noyes, allegedly involved.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naske|first1=Claus-M.|title=Frontier Politics: Alaska's|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=132|edition=3rd}}</ref> Through his hard work, and his tenacity, he made sure everyone understood his authority. His start into Alaskan official law was a litigation of most profound simplicity, and the epitome of Alaskan frontier spirit. \"Chief Charley, head of the Charley River band of the Tena Indians, was the first litigant to appeal to the new court officials for justice.\"<ref name=Wickersham2010 /> Someone from upriver had stolen his dog, a very serious offense that warranted violence if this new American law official could not have it solved within his power peacefully. After being given the run around, Charley finally reached Wickersham and consulted the highest court in the land. After listening carefully Wickersham appointed a deputy to retrieve the stolen animal, and waited with the chief for his return, chatting about everyday problems.<ref name=Wickersham2010 /> When the dog was safely returned two points were driven home, the concrete authority of Judge Wickersham, and that his tenure in Alaska would be one of action.\n\nAs the most powerful personage of Federal oversight for the vast majority of the interior of Alaska, Wickersham was an important man to have on your side.  His relationship with the development of Fairbanks helped shape not only the future of the Interior's steadily expanding city, but also the shape of things to come for the state. Wickersham's working relationship with Captain [[E.T. Barnette]] led to the initially small settlement developing into a city that became a gateway to the arctic. Through Barnette and Wickersham's efforts, Fairbanks became incorporated, initiated federal development, and settled locations for key federal positions in the city thus insuring its future relevance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Terrence|title=Crooked Past: The history of a Frontier Mining Camp: Fairbanks, Alaska|date=1991|publisher=University of Alaska Press|location=Fairbanks, AK|isbn=0-912006-53-6|page=73}}</ref>\n\nThough they worked well together for the betterment of Alaska, and particularly the interior, they did not always have the best personal relationship. When presiding over one of Barnette's many gold claim cases, he inferred that if the case went in his favor, Wickersham could benefit from the decision himself after his term was over. \"It was an outright bribe.\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Terrence|title=Crooked Past: The history of a Frontier Mining Camp: Fairbanks, Alaska|date=1991|publisher=University of Alaska Press|location=Fairbanks, AK|isbn=0-912006-53-6|page=90}}</ref> Quoted one historian. Personal opinions and ever changing allegiances aside, as far as the future of Fairbanks went, Barnette could always count on Wickersham to have his back as what Barnette wanted usually was what was best for Fairbanks. As Wickersham finished up his time as judge, he moved on to represent Alaskas' interests in Washington.\n\n==Congressional delegate==\n\nFrom the position of the judge on the trail in Alaska, Wickersham successfully ran for the position of congressional delegate for the District of Alaska in 1908 beginning his term in 1909. In his first two terms as delegate, Wickersham focused on two aspects: territorial status for Alaska and trust-busting the Alaska Syndicate. [[File:James Wickersham at First National Bank, 1900-1916.jpg|thumb|Photo of James Wickersham standing in front of a First National Bank Assay Office, holding a gold (?) brick, cigar in mouth.]]\n\nThe issue of home-rule in Alaska falls under the popular idea that Alaska had been neglected by the [[United States federal government]] since its purchase from Russia in 1867 and was denied any form of self-government. The first semblance of self-government came through the First Organic Act in 1884.

However, the Organic Act of 1884 was simply a start to government in Alaska and it still left the control of Alaska's resources to the federal government and largely, outside private interests.\n\n[[File:James Wickersham Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|James Wickersham Portrait photo, 1921-1922]]The [[Alaska Syndicate]], a conglomeration of privately owned businesses headed by Guggenheim interests, represented outside rule of Alaska's resources. Their main focus was \"\u2026the development of copper, holdings. It was for this purpose that it acquired and operated transportation lines.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Jeannette Paddock|title=Alaska; a History of Its Administration, Exploitation, and Industrial Development During Its First Half Century under the Rule of the United States|date=1924|publisher=Arther H. Clark Co.|pages=340}}</ref>  Thus, the Alaska Syndicate not only ruled the copper fields but the steamship lines that moved the copper back to the United States. When Wickersham became the Delegate for Alaska, he vowed to relinquish the Alaska Syndicate's hold on copper and transportation. \nOne of the first issues that brought the Alaska Syndicate and Wickersham into battle was over Wickersham's first attempt to create a territorial legislature in 1909. According to Wickersham's first bill as delegate, \"it provided for a legislature of twenty-four members \u2013 eight in the Senate and sixteen in the House.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Atwood|first1=Evangeline|title=Frontier Politics: Alaska's James Wickersham|date=1979|publisher=Binford & Mort|location=Portland, OR|pages=200|edition=1st}}</ref>  However, President Taft believed that Alaska was not ready for territorial government and status. For the Alaska Syndicate, this brought relief. Those interested in Alaska's resources had opposed Wickersham due to the fear of industry taxes on their copper holdings if Alaska progressed to territorial status, or even worse, statehood.\n\nOnly two years later in Wickersham's second term as delegate, the home-rule bill passed as the Second Organic Act in 1912 establishing Alaska officially as a United States territory with a legislature. While Congress still maintained heavy control over the territory, it allowed Wickersham to move against the Alaska Syndicate. Continuing on the forward momentum of the Second Organic Act, Wickersham sought, \"\u2026congressional authorization for a federal railroad in Alaska.\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haycox|first1=Stephen|title=Alaska: An American Colony|date=2002|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle, WA|pages=230}}</ref> While this again would bring more government control to Alaska, it did mean that the Guggenheim hold on transportation would be severely weakened. In order to see this bill passed in the senate, Wickersham stood for over five hours delivering a speech to Congress, at that time the longest speech on record. His effort was not wasted and \"the bill passed the Senate on January 24 by a vote of 46 to 16.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Atwood|first1=Evangeline|title=Frontier Politics: Alaska's James Wickersham|publisher=Binford & Mort|location=Portland, OR|pages=275|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nWickersham would go on to serve several more terms as Alaska's delegate to Congress, his last term running from 1931-1933. His time as delegate began major political themes in Alaska's history that still hold today. Alaska exists on the paradoxical theory of demanding state rule over its resources and yet still incredibly dependent on the federal government largely through, presently, the investment of the Department of Defense. Wickersham's dilemma began this mindset of federal dependence because he saw that as a better alternative than having private interests and \"Robber-Barons\" ruling over Alaska's resources.\n\n===Oratory===\n{{Quote|text=The Democratic nominee was a Fairbanks lawyer and [[List of mayors of Fairbanks, Alaska|one-time mayor]], Thomas A.

Denali (first Dinmore's Mountain, then Mt. McKinley). Departing from Fairbanks May 16, 1903, on the Tanana Chief steamer with two mules, Mark and Hannah. There were four companions that joined him on the trip: George Jeffrey, Mort Stevens, Charlie Web and John McLeod. To finance the venture the men published the first Tanana region Newspaper \"The Fairbanks Miner, Vol. 1, No.1, May, 1903\", eight pages typed up on a typewriter.\n\nOn the second day of being on the steamer, Wickersham's party had a stroke of luck and discovered a boat drifting through the river ice flow. The team dubbed Wickersham the Admiral of the newly named Mudlark and used the boat while traversing the Kantishna River.\nBy June 4 the excursion party had staked Gold Claims on Chitsia Creek, and thanks to a map with description filed at Rampart, led to larger prospecting for the Kantishna Mining.\n\nThe trip took a turn of misfortune when the party came to an impassable mountain face, later known as Wickersham Wall. It was June 20 Wickersham wrote in his diary \"...and have reluctantly concluded there is no possible chance of further ascent from this side of Denali at this season--or any other season for that matter.\"\n\nEven more defeating for the party, is a wreck of their raft in a glacial stream on the descent that destroys their food supply and equipment. Hungry, tired, and terrorized by mosquitoes the group \"happily ended the first attempt of white men...to scale the mighty walls of Denali.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wickersham|first1=James|title=Old Yuikon: Tales-Trails-Trails|date=1938|publisher=West Publishing Co.|location=St. Paul, MN|pages=312}}</ref>\n...\nThe first attempted summit of Denali took place in 1903. The mountaineer was Judge James Wickersham. He attempted to climb the mountain via Peters Glacier and the North Face, but he fell far short of his goal. The route Wickersham tried to ascend wasn\u2019t accomplished until 1963 due to avalanche dangers.

He resigned his post in 1908 and was subsequently elected as Alaska's delegate to [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]], serving until 1917 and then being re-elected in 1930. He was instrumental in the passage of the [[Organic Act]] of 1912, which granted Alaska territorial status, introduced the Alaska Railroad Bill, legislation to establish [[Denali National Park and Preserve|McKinley Park]], and the first [[Alaska Statehood Bill]] in 1916. He was among those responsible for the creation of the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, which later became the [[University of Alaska]]. A residence hall on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus is named in his honor.\n\nWickersham was born near [[Patoka, Illinois]] and moved in 1883 with his wife, Deborah, to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington Territory]], where he became a judge. While in Tacoma he helped lead a mob which forced the city's Chinese population out of town, and was later arrested as one of the \"Tacoma Twenty-Seven,\" though he was never convicted. He was a member of the Tacoma Academy of Science and was President of that organization in 1893.  He presented a paper to the Academy on 6 Feb, 1893, entitled, Is it Mount Tacoma, or Rainier?  During the presentation the \"following prominent Indians representing the Puyallup, Nesqually and Klickitat tribes were seated on the platform:  George Leschi, son of Quiemuth, a leader in the Indian war of 1855; Jack Simmons; John Hiaton, one of the patriarchs of the reservation, 80 years of age, and a signer of the treaty of 1854; Mrs. John Hiaton and John Powers\".

Noyes]] in Nome and previously established [[Melville C. Brown]] in Juneau, he was now one of the three most powerful people in Alaska, with no one within 3,000 miles to overrule his decisions or stand in his way. After the Nome Gold Conspiracy involving prominent Republican National Committee member [[Alexander McKenzie (politician)|Alexander McKenzie]], it was Wickersham they turned to clean up the legal mess left by then ousted Judge Noyes, allegedly involved.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naske|first1=Claus-M.|title=Frontier Politics: Alaska's|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=132|edition=3rd}}</ref> Through his hard work, and his tenacity, he made sure everyone understood his authority. His start into Alaskan official law was a litigation of most profound simplicity, and the epitome of Alaskan frontier spirit. \"Chief Charley, head of the Charley River band of the Tena Indians, was the first litigant to appeal to the new court officials for justice.\"<ref name=Wickersham2010 /> Someone from upriver had stolen his dog, a very serious offense that warranted violence if this new American law official could not have it solved within his power peacefully. After being given the run around, Charley finally reached Wickersham and consulted the highest court in the land. After listening carefully Wickersham appointed a deputy to retrieve the stolen animal, and waited with the chief for his return, chatting about everyday problems.<ref name=Wickersham2010 /> When the dog was safely returned two points were driven home, the concrete authority of Judge Wickersham, and that his tenure in Alaska would be one of action.\n\nAs the most powerful personage of Federal oversight for the vast majority of the interior of Alaska, Wickersham was an important man to have on your side.  His relationship with the development of Fairbanks helped shape not only the future of the Interior's steadily expanding city, but also the shape of things to come for the state. Wickersham's working relationship with Captain [[E.T. Barnette]] led to the initially small settlement developing into a city that became a gateway to the arctic. Through Barnette and Wickersham's efforts, Fairbanks became incorporated, initiated federal development, and settled locations for key federal positions in the city thus insuring its future relevance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Terrence|title=Crooked Past: The history of a Frontier Mining Camp: Fairbanks, Alaska|date=1991|publisher=University of Alaska Press|location=Fairbanks, AK|isbn=0-912006-53-6|page=73}}</ref>\n\nThough they worked well together for the betterment of Alaska, and particularly the interior, they did not always have the best personal relationship. When presiding over one of Barnette's many gold claim cases, he inferred that if the case went in his favor, Wickersham could benefit from the decision himself after his term was over. \"It was an outright bribe.\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Terrence|title=Crooked Past: The history of a Frontier Mining Camp: Fairbanks, Alaska|date=1991|publisher=University of Alaska Press|location=Fairbanks, AK|isbn=0-912006-53-6|page=90}}</ref> Quoted one historian. Personal opinions and ever changing allegiances aside, as far as the future of Fairbanks went, Barnette could always count on Wickersham to have his back as what Barnette wanted usually was what was best for Fairbanks. As Wickersham finished up his time as judge, he moved on to represent Alaskas' interests in Washington.\n\n==Congressional delegate==\n\nFrom the position of the judge on the trail in Alaska, Wickersham successfully ran for the position of congressional delegate for the District of Alaska in 1908 beginning his term in 1909. In his first two terms as delegate, Wickersham focused on two aspects: territorial status for Alaska and trust-busting the Alaska Syndicate. [[File:James Wickersham at First National Bank, 1900-1916.jpg|thumb|Photo of James Wickersham standing in front of a First National Bank Assay Office, holding a gold (?) brick, cigar in mouth.]]\n\nThe issue of home-rule in Alaska falls under the popular idea that Alaska had been neglected by the [[United States federal government]] since its purchase from Russia in 1867 and was denied any form of self-government. The first semblance of self-government came through the First Organic Act in 1884. This act instated \"\u2026a governor, judge, attorney, clerk of court, marshal, four deputy marshals, and four commissioners, who were to function as justices of the peace.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naske|first1=Claus-M.|title=Frontier Politics: Alaska's|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=117|edition=3rd}}</ref> Mainly as a reactionary to the huge population increase during the Klondike gold rush, these government offices were not voted in by Alaskans, but appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate each for a four-year term.
