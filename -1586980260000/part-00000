From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880.

The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced. Which was the first cathedral of the city before the current one was completed in 1711. Another atraction is the Caxa real, a colonial house that was built between 1739 and 1741 and developed by the architect Bartolom\u00e9 de Maradiaga as a center where the tributes for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] were stored, within it Gold, silver and plaster extracted from the mines of Honduras were processed, to later be shipped to Europe. On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor. In 1774, an earthquake that caused serious damage to the structure, however, was repaired within a few months, although the house was weaker. In 1809 another earthquake damaged the building. It was rebuilt in 2013 and is currently an events center that has hosted important international political figures, such as [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen Leticia of Spain]], and the former President of Mexico on his visit to Honduras. \n\n<br />\n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

Wilkins was a nine-time [[NBA All-Star]], and is widely viewed as one of the best [[slam dunk|dunkers]] in NBA history, earning the nickname \"'''the Human Highlight Film'''\".<ref name=wilkins_summary>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |title=Dominique Wilkins Summary |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011052602/http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos Athens]] (a professional team in [[Greek basketball league system|Greece's top-tier level]] [[Greek Basket League]], with whom he won his first titles, the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]), [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Fortitudo Bologna]] (a professional team in [[Italian basketball league system|Italy's top-tier level]] [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]]), the [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Orlando Magic]] before he retired in 1999.\n\n==Early life and college==\nWilkins was born in [[Paris, France]] while his father was stationed there as an airman in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Wilkins' family then moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in [[Washington, North Carolina]], where he attended Washington High School.  He was the back-to-back MVP for the team's consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978\u20131979). Wilkins was in the \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the [[McDonald's All-American Game]], The Capital Classic, The Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and The Dapper Dan Classic All-Star Games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald's, 26 points in the Capital, and 22 points in the Derby Classic. He entered the [[University of Georgia]] in 1979 with an established reputation as an exciting player. Wilkins averaged 21.6 points a game over his career and was named [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1988 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Dominique Wilkins (b. 1960) |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |title=Men's Basketball \u2013 All-Time Award Winners |publisher=Southeastern Conference |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231531/http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>  He left college after his junior year.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nWilkins was selected third overall (behind [[James Worthy]] and [[Terry Cummings]]) by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1982 NBA draft]]. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah. At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] several months after the draft for [[John Drew (basketball)|John Drew]], [[Freeman Williams]] and $1 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGJkfbA3RE |title=Basketball \u2013 He Got Pushed Away}}</ref> Despite Wilkins's reluctance to play in Utah, the trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history, as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.\n\nWilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386]] with an average of 30.3 points per game.\n\nWilkins was instrumental in the Hawks' prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]].\n\nA nine-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] and the winner of two [[NBA slam dunk contest]]s, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2019, he ranks 13th on the NBA scoring list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Points |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=Mar 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWilkins' nickname was \"The Human Highlight Film\" for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks.  His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.\n\nHis #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.\n\n====Early NBA years====\nWilkins notched his first [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest|Slam-Dunk Championship]] at the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Indianapolis during the 1984\u201385 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984\u201385. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34\u201348 and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\nWilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985\u201386, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 [[Spud Webb|Anthony \"Spud\" Webb]] as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than {{convert|4|ft|m}} to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985\u201386 season to finish 50\u201332 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks' leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). Atlanta beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] in four games in the first round of the playoffs, but the Hawks could not get past the eventual NBA-champion [[Boston Celtics]], losing four games to one in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Wilkins averaged 28.6 points in the nine playoff games.\n\nAfter playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since [[Edward Johnson, Jr.|Eddie Johnson]] in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to [[Michael Jordan]]'s 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season's end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50\u201332 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. [[Doc Rivers]], [[Kevin Willis]], [[Tree Rollins]], and [[Mike McGee (basketball)|Mike McGee]] contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.\n\n====Late 1980's====\nIn the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138\u2013133 victory.\n\nAtlanta (50\u201332) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals]] before losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and [[Larry Bird]] carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118\u2013116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. \"The basket was like a well,\" remembered Wilkins. \"I couldn\u2019t miss. He couldn\u2019t miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I\u2019ve ever played in or seen played. It was two guys who just did not want to lose.\"\n\nDuring the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins's scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season's end. The Hawks added [[Reggie Theus]] and [[Moses Malone]] to the team in 1988\u201389. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Kevin Willis]], however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.\n\nWilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989\u201390 by edging out the [[Sacramento Kings]]\u2019 [[Kenny Smith]] for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985\u201386, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41\u201341 record in [[Mike Fratello]]'s last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins' career.\n\n====1990's====\nWilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]], leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game\u2014seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East's 116\u2013114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year's absence, drawing the defending NBA champion [[1990\u201391 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113\u201381, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Wilkins' ruptured his Achilles tendon against the [[1991\u201392 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the [[1991\u201392 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] were the most by an NBA player that season.\n\nThe following season, Wilkins would recover from his injury and eventually win the NBA Comeback Player of the Year award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballislife.com/32-year-old-dominique-wilkins-injures-achilles-in-1992-comes-back-next-year-to-average-30-ppg/ |title=32 year old Dominique Wilkins injures Achilles in 1992 / Averages 30 Points the following season |publisher=Ballislife.com |date=April 13, 2013 |accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref> He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the [[1992\u201393 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], he broke [[Bob Pettit]]'s franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. The [[1992\u201393 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] swept the Hawks in the first round of the playoffs 3\u20130.\n\n===Los Angeles Clippers and Boston===\nWilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11\u00bd years with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Wilkins was traded to the [[1993\u201394 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]] on February 24 in exchange for [[Danny Manning]].  This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36\u201316 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade.  Wilkins' contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.\n\nThe top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the [[1993\u201394 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins' 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA's all-time list.  Wilkins became a free agent after the 1993\u201394 season and signed with the Boston Celtics.

During the [[1996 FIBA European League Final Four|1996 EuroLeague Final Four]], that was held in his birthplace of Paris, Wilkins had 35 points and 8 rebounds in the semifinal against [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], and a double-double, with 16 points and 10 rebounds against [[FC Barcelona (basketball)|Barcelona]] in the [[EuroLeague Final|final]].

Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996\u201397. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before [[Tim Duncan]].\n\nHowever, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Teamsystem Bologna]] of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]], for the 1997\u201398 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League.<ref>[http://web.legabasket.it/player/?id=WIL-DOM-60 Dominique Wilkins Teamsystem Bologna {{in lang|it}}.]</ref> With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the [[1997\u201398 FIBA EuroLeague|FIBA EuroLeague 1997\u201398 season]].<ref>[http://www.fibaeurope.com/compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.season_1998.roundID_2569.playerID_19042.teamID_2622.html Jacques Dominique Wilkins.]</ref> Wilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998\u201399 campaign, alongside his brother [[Gerald Wilkins]], with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\n===Slam dunk contests===\nWilkins participated in five [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contests]], winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind [[Larry Nance]] and [[Julius Erving]]. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat [[Michael Jordan]] in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'7\" teammate, [[Spud Webb]].\n\nThe 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins' first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins' completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins' head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest's most controversial crown.\n\nIn 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as [[Kenny Smith]], [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Kenny Walker]] (the 1989 champion). He defeated [[Kenny Smith]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] in the final round.\n\n== Later life ==\nSince 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks' Vice President of Basketball.

Dominique Wilkins''' (born January 12, 1960) is an American retired [[professional]] [[basketball]] player who primarily played for the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Wilkins was a nine-time [[NBA All-Star]], and is widely viewed as one of the best [[slam dunk|dunkers]] in NBA history, earning the nickname \"'''the Human Highlight Film'''\".<ref name=wilkins_summary>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |title=Dominique Wilkins Summary |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011052602/http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos Athens]] (a professional team in [[Greek basketball league system|Greece's top-tier level]] [[Greek Basket League]], with whom he won his first titles, the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]), [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Fortitudo Bologna]] (a professional team in [[Italian basketball league system|Italy's top-tier level]] [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]]), the [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Orlando Magic]] before he retired in 1999.\n\n==Early life and college==\nWilkins was born in [[Paris, France]] while his father was stationed there as an airman in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Wilkins' family then moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in [[Washington, North Carolina]], where he attended Washington High School.  He was the back-to-back MVP for the team's consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978\u20131979). Wilkins was in the \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the [[McDonald's All-American Game]], The Capital Classic, The Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and The Dapper Dan Classic All-Star Games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald's, 26 points in the Capital, and 22 points in the Derby Classic. He entered the [[University of Georgia]] in 1979 with an established reputation as an exciting player. Wilkins averaged 21.6 points a game over his career and was named [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1988 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Dominique Wilkins (b. 1960) |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |title=Men's Basketball \u2013 All-Time Award Winners |publisher=Southeastern Conference |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231531/http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>  He left college after his junior year.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nWilkins was selected third overall (behind [[James Worthy]] and [[Terry Cummings]]) by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1982 NBA draft]]. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah. At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] several months after the draft for [[John Drew (basketball)|John Drew]], [[Freeman Williams]] and $1 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGJkfbA3RE |title=Basketball \u2013 He Got Pushed Away}}</ref> Despite Wilkins's reluctance to play in Utah, the trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history, as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.\n\nWilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386]] with an average of 30.3 points per game.\n\nWilkins was instrumental in the Hawks' prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]].\n\nA nine-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] and the winner of two [[NBA slam dunk contest]]s, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2019, he ranks 13th on the NBA scoring list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Points |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=Mar 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWilkins' nickname was \"The Human Highlight Film\" for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks.  His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.\n\nHis #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.\n\n====Early NBA years====\nWilkins notched his first [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest|Slam-Dunk Championship]] at the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Indianapolis during the 1984\u201385 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984\u201385. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34\u201348 and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\nWilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985\u201386, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 [[Spud Webb|Anthony \"Spud\" Webb]] as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than {{convert|4|ft|m}} to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985\u201386 season to finish 50\u201332 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks' leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). Atlanta beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] in four games in the first round of the playoffs, but the Hawks could not get past the eventual NBA-champion [[Boston Celtics]], losing four games to one in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Wilkins averaged 28.6 points in the nine playoff games.\n\nAfter playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since [[Edward Johnson, Jr.|Eddie Johnson]] in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to [[Michael Jordan]]'s 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season's end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50\u201332 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. [[Doc Rivers]], [[Kevin Willis]], [[Tree Rollins]], and [[Mike McGee (basketball)|Mike McGee]] contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.\n\n====Late 1980's====\nIn the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138\u2013133 victory.\n\nAtlanta (50\u201332) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals]] before losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and [[Larry Bird]] carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118\u2013116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. \"The basket was like a well,\" remembered Wilkins. \"I couldn\u2019t miss. He couldn\u2019t miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I\u2019ve ever played in or seen played. It was two guys who just did not want to lose.\"\n\nDuring the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins's scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season's end. The Hawks added [[Reggie Theus]] and [[Moses Malone]] to the team in 1988\u201389. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Kevin Willis]], however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.\n\nWilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989\u201390 by edging out the [[Sacramento Kings]]\u2019 [[Kenny Smith]] for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985\u201386, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41\u201341 record in [[Mike Fratello]]'s last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins' career.\n\n====1990's====\nWilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]], leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game\u2014seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East's 116\u2013114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year's absence, drawing the defending NBA champion [[1990\u201391 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113\u201381, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Wilkins' ruptured his Achilles tendon against the [[1991\u201392 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the [[1991\u201392 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] were the most by an NBA player that season.\n\nThe following season, Wilkins would recover from his injury and eventually win the NBA Comeback Player of the Year award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballislife.com/32-year-old-dominique-wilkins-injures-achilles-in-1992-comes-back-next-year-to-average-30-ppg/ |title=32 year old Dominique Wilkins injures Achilles in 1992 / Averages 30 Points the following season |publisher=Ballislife.com |date=April 13, 2013 |accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref> He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the [[1992\u201393 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], he broke [[Bob Pettit]]'s franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. The [[1992\u201393 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] swept the Hawks in the first round of the playoffs 3\u20130.\n\n===Los Angeles Clippers and Boston===\nWilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11\u00bd years with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Wilkins was traded to the [[1993\u201394 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]] on February 24 in exchange for [[Danny Manning]].  This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36\u201316 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade.  Wilkins' contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.\n\nThe top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the [[1993\u201394 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins' 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA's all-time list.  Wilkins became a free agent after the 1993\u201394 season and signed with the Boston Celtics.

During the [[1996 FIBA European League Final Four|1996 EuroLeague Final Four]], that was held in his birthplace of Paris, Wilkins had 35 points and 8 rebounds in the semifinal against [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], and a double-double, with 16 points and 10 rebounds against [[FC Barcelona (basketball)|Barcelona]] in the [[EuroLeague Final|final]].

However, he failed to win the national championship of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] 1995\u201396 season, as his team, Panathinaikos, lost the Greek League Finals to their arch-rivals, [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], 3 games to 2.

Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996\u201397. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before [[Tim Duncan]].\n\nHowever, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Teamsystem Bologna]] of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]], for the 1997\u201398 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League.<ref>[http://web.legabasket.it/player/?id=WIL-DOM-60 Dominique Wilkins Teamsystem Bologna {{in lang|it}}.]</ref> With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the [[1997\u201398 FIBA EuroLeague|FIBA EuroLeague 1997\u201398 season]].<ref>[http://www.fibaeurope.com/compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.season_1998.roundID_2569.playerID_19042.teamID_2622.html Jacques Dominique Wilkins.]</ref> Wilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998\u201399 campaign, alongside his brother [[Gerald Wilkins]], with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\n===Slam dunk contests===\nWilkins participated in five [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contests]], winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind [[Larry Nance]] and [[Julius Erving]]. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat [[Michael Jordan]] in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'7\" teammate, [[Spud Webb]].\n\nThe 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins' first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins' completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins' head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest's most controversial crown.\n\nIn 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as [[Kenny Smith]], [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Kenny Walker]] (the 1989 champion). He defeated [[Kenny Smith]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] in the final round.\n\n== Later life ==\nSince 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks' Vice President of Basketball.

''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', released only in Japan at the time, reuses gameplay elements from ''Super Mario Bros.'', though the game is much more difficult than its predecessor. Nintendo of America disliked ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', which they found to be frustratingly difficult and otherwise little more than a modification of ''Super Mario Bros.'' Rather than risk the franchise's popularity, they cancelled its stateside release and looked for an alternative.

''The Adventure of Link'' features [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] areas within a larger world map rather than the [[Top-down perspective|bird's eye view]] of the previous title. The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more [[role-playing video game|RPG]] elements, including an [[experience point]]s (EXP) system, [[Magic (gaming)|magic spells]], and more interaction with [[non-player character]]s (NPCs).

The [[overworld]], the area where the majority of the action occurs in other ''The Legend of Zelda'' games, is still from a [[top-down perspective]], but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] view. These separate methods of traveling and entering combat are one of many aspects adapted from the [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] genre.<ref name=\"game\" /> The game was highly successful at the time, and introduced elements such as Link's \"magic meter\" and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games, although the role-playing elements such as experience points and the platform-style side-scrolling and multiple lives were never used again in the official series. The game is also looked upon as one of the most difficult games in the ''Zelda'' series and 8-bit gaming as a whole. Additionally, ''The Adventure of Link'' was one of the first games to combine [[role-playing video game]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements to a considerable degree.\n\nSoon after, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' was developed by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]]; the game took more than two years to complete.<ref name=\"IGN-100\">{{cite web| url = http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_39.html| title = IGN Top 100 Games 2007: 39 Super Mario Bros. 3| website = IGN| year = 2007| accessdate = January 25, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170409163615/http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_39.html| archive-date = April 9, 2017| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The game offers numerous modifications on the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ranging from costumes with different abilities to new enemies.<ref name=\"IGN-100\" /><ref name=\"IGN-MarioHistory\">{{cite web| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p2.html| title = The History of the Super Mario Bros| website = IGN| first = Rus| last = McLaughlin| date = November 8, 2007| accessdate = January 26, 2009}}</ref> Bowser's children were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work on the game.<ref name=\"IGN-100\" /> The Koopalings' names were later altered to mimic names of well-known, [[Western culture|Western]] musicians in the [[Internationalization and localization|English localization]].<ref name=\"IGN-100\" /> In a first for the ''Mario'' series, the player navigates via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a level playfield.

He said, \"The reason behind using such a simple process, as I am sure you have all experienced in the workshop, is that there is a total limit on team energy. There is a limit to the work a team can do, and there is a limit to my own energy. We opted not to use that limited time and energy on pre-rendered images for use in cinema scenes, but rather on tests on other inter-active elements and polishing up the game\".<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/>\n\nFor these reasons, he opposes prerendered cutscenes.<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/><ref name=\"Iwata Asks OoT 3D Miyamoto\" /><ref name=\"Miyamoto Talks Dolphin at Space World 99\" /><ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/> Of ''Ocarina of Time'', he says \"we were able to make use of truly cinematic methods with our camera work without relying on [prerendered video].\"<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/>\n\nIn 2003, he described his \"fundamental dislike\" of the [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] (RPG) genre: \"I think that with an RPG you are completely bound hand and foot, and can't move. But gradually you become able to move your hands and legs... you become slightly untied. And in the end, you feel powerful. So what you get out of an RPG is a feeling of happiness. But I don't think they're something that's fundamentally fun to play. With a game like that, anyone can become really good at it.

Nintendo of America disliked ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', which they found to be frustratingly difficult and otherwise little more than a modification of ''Super Mario Bros.'' Rather than risk the franchise's popularity, they cancelled its stateside release and looked for an alternative.

''The Adventure of Link'' features [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] areas within a larger world map rather than the [[Top-down perspective|bird's eye view]] of the previous title. The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more [[role-playing video game|RPG]] elements, including an [[experience point]]s (EXP) system, [[Magic (gaming)|magic spells]], and more interaction with [[non-player character]]s (NPCs).

The [[overworld]], the area where the majority of the action occurs in other ''The Legend of Zelda'' games, is still from a [[top-down perspective]], but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] view. These separate methods of traveling and entering combat are one of many aspects adapted from the [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] genre.<ref name=\"game\" /> The game was highly successful at the time, and introduced elements such as Link's \"magic meter\" and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games, although the role-playing elements such as experience points and the platform-style side-scrolling and multiple lives were never used again in the official series. The game is also looked upon as one of the most difficult games in the ''Zelda'' series and 8-bit gaming as a whole. Additionally, ''The Adventure of Link'' was one of the first games to combine [[role-playing video game]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements to a considerable degree.\n\nSoon after, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' was developed by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]]; the game took more than two years to complete.<ref name=\"IGN-100\">{{cite web| url = http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_39.html| title = IGN Top 100 Games 2007: 39 Super Mario Bros. 3| website = IGN| year = 2007| accessdate = January 25, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170409163615/http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_39.html| archive-date = April 9, 2017| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The game offers numerous modifications on the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ranging from costumes with different abilities to new enemies.<ref name=\"IGN-100\" /><ref name=\"IGN-MarioHistory\">{{cite web| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p2.html| title = The History of the Super Mario Bros| website = IGN| first = Rus| last = McLaughlin| date = November 8, 2007| accessdate = January 26, 2009}}</ref> Bowser's children were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work on the game.<ref name=\"IGN-100\" /> The Koopalings' names were later altered to mimic names of well-known, [[Western culture|Western]] musicians in the [[Internationalization and localization|English localization]].<ref name=\"IGN-100\" /> In a first for the ''Mario'' series, the player navigates via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a level playfield.

Instead, Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun for himself. He says that if he enjoys it, others will too.<ref name=\"New Yorker\" /> He elaborates, citing the conception of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series as an example, \"And that's the point \u2013 Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It's the very core feeling we should have in making games.\"<ref name=\"Miyamoto Talks Dolphin at Space World 99\">{{cite interview | title=Miyamoto Talks Dolphin at Space World '99 | publisher=GameSpot | date=August 28, 1999 | interviewer=Chris Johnston | first=Shigeru | last=Miyamoto | subjectlink=Shigeru Miyamoto | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-talks-dolphin-at-space-world-and14599/1100-2460819/ | accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Miyamoto wants players to experience ''[[kyokan]]''; he wants \"the players to feel about the game what the developers felt themselves.\"<ref name=\"New Yorker\" />\n\nHe then tests it with friends and family. He encourages younger developers to consider people who are new to gaming, for example by having them switch their dominant hand with their other hand to feel the experience of an unfamiliar game.<ref name=\"New Yorker\" />\n\nMiyamoto's philosophy does not focus on hyper-realistic graphics, although he realizes they have their place. He is more focused on the game mechanics, such as the choices and challenges in the game.<ref name=\"New Yorker\" /> Similar to how manga artists subverted their genre, Miyamoto hopes to subvert some of the basic principles he had popularized in his early games, retaining some elements but eliminating others.<ref name=\"New Yorker\" />\n\nHis use of real-time rendered cinematics (not prerendered video) serves both his own rapidly interactive development process with no rendering delays, and the player's interaction with the game's continuity. He prefers to change his games right until they are finalized, and to make \"something unique and unprecedented\". He prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, \"I will never make movie-like games\";<ref name=\"Miyamoto Talks Dolphin at Space World 99\" /> therefore, the more than 90 total minutes of short cutscenes interspersed throughout ''Ocarina of Time''<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/> deliver more interactive cinematic qualities.<ref name=\"Miyamoto Talks Dolphin at Space World 99\" /><ref name=\"Iwata Asks OoT 3D Original\">{{cite interview|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/1/0 | interviewer=[[Satoru Iwata]] | first1=Toshio | last1=Iwawaki | first2=Eiji | last2=Aonuma | first3=Takumi | last3=Kawagoe | first4=Yoshiaki | last4=Koizumi | first5=Toru | last5=Osawa | title=Iwata Asks: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D: Original Development Staff \u2013 Part 1 |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref>{{rp|5}} His vision mandates a rapid and malleable development process with small teams, as when he directed substantial changes to the overall game scenario in the final months of the development of ''Ocarina of Time''. He said, \"The reason behind using such a simple process, as I am sure you have all experienced in the workshop, is that there is a total limit on team energy. There is a limit to the work a team can do, and there is a limit to my own energy. We opted not to use that limited time and energy on pre-rendered images for use in cinema scenes, but rather on tests on other inter-active elements and polishing up the game\".<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/>\n\nFor these reasons, he opposes prerendered cutscenes.<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/><ref name=\"Iwata Asks OoT 3D Miyamoto\" /><ref name=\"Miyamoto Talks Dolphin at Space World 99\" /><ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/> Of ''Ocarina of Time'', he says \"we were able to make use of truly cinematic methods with our camera work without relying on [prerendered video].\"<ref name=\"GDC: Miyamoto Keynote\"/>\n\nIn 2003, he described his \"fundamental dislike\" of the [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] (RPG) genre: \"I think that with an RPG you are completely bound hand and foot, and can't move. But gradually you become able to move your hands and legs... you become slightly untied. And in the end, you feel powerful. So what you get out of an RPG is a feeling of happiness. But I don't think they're something that's fundamentally fun to play. With a game like that, anyone can become really good at it.
