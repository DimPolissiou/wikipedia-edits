He starts up a Spanish study group in order to score with attractive classmate Britta Perry ([[Gillian Jacobs]]), who invites her friend Abed Nadir ([[Danny Pudi]]), who in turn invites classmates Troy Barnes ([[Donald Glover]]), Annie Edison ([[Alison Brie]]), Shirley Bennett ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]), and Pierce Hawthorne ([[Chevy Chase]]). After believing he has secured a date with Britta, Jeff stirs up conflict within the group in order to leave with her, only to be confronted by her about his ulterior motive. When he gives an inspirational speech to calm them down and finally go out with Britta, she reveals his true intentions and asks him to leave. Jeff storms out, only to find out the answers obtained from Dr. Duncan are actually blank. As he is leaving campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy who are encouraged by his advice.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known from her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nThe premise of ''Community'' was based on Harmon's real-life experiences.

Chang however cannot go through with the beating, since he would be expelled for hitting a member of the Greendale staff.

Though principally not very partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded to take the job by the quality of the show's writing.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show.

Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known from her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nThe premise of ''Community'' was based on Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself.  He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a film, not a sitcom.

Ruled by Ascanian princes from the [[High Middle Ages]] to the [[Early modern period]], Anhalt was divided several times amongst various lines of the dynasty until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806, when [[Napoleon]] elevated the remaining states of [[Anhalt-Bernburg]], [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and [[Anhalt-K\u00f6then]] to duchies.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Anhalt territory stretched from the [[Harz]] mountain range in the west to the [[Elbe]] River and beyond to the [[Fl\u00e4ming Heath]] in the east. Upon the 1315 loss of [[Principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben|Anhalt-Aschersleben]], the lands around Ballenstedt formed a western [[enclave and exclave|exclave]]. The area of the later duchy was 906&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi (2,300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\n\nIn the west, the land is undulating and in the extreme northwest, where it forms part of the Harz mountains, hilly, with the [[Ramberg (Harz)]] peak as the tallest point at 1,900&nbsp;ft (579&nbsp;m). From the Harz the country gently shelves down to the [[Saale]]; the land between this river and the Elbe is particularly fertile. East of the Elbe, the land is mostly a flat sandy plain, with extensive [[pine]] forests, interspersed with bog-land and rich pastures. The Elbe is the chief river, intersecting the eastern portion of the former duchy, from east to west, and at [[Rosslau]] is met by the [[Mulde]].  The navigable Saale takes a northerly direction through the central portion of the territory and receives, on the right, the [[Fuhne]] and, on the left, the [[Wipper (Saale)|Wipper]] and the [[Bode (Wipper)|Bode]].\n\nThe climate is generally mild, less so in the higher Harz regions to the south-west.\n\n== History ==\nFrom the 9th century onward, the western parts of the later Anhalt territory up to the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers were included in the ''[[Schwabengau]]'' region of [[Eastphalia]], the eastern part of the medieval Duchy of Saxony. In the 11th century, it came under the rule of Count [[Esico of Ballenstedt]] (died 1059 or 1060), mentioned in a 1036 deed issued by Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] at [[Tilleda]]. Possibly a descendant of the Saxon margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo]], he owned large [[allod]]ial lands around [[Ballenstedt]] in the ''Schwabengau'' as well as in the adjacent ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' Serimunt in the former [[Saxon Eastern March]]. \n[[File:SchlossBallenstedt2005.jpg|thumb|Ballenstedt Castle]]\nCount Esico was succeeded by his son [[Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt|Adalbert II of Ballenstedt]], who also appeared as a count in the Saxon [[Nordth\u00fcringgau]] and further territories in the Eastern March. Adalbert joined the [[Saxon Rebellion]] against King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and was slain in a feud with [[Egeno II of Konradsburg]] in 1180. His son Count [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt|Otto the Rich]] appeared as a \"Count of Ballenstedt\" from 1106. When Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] temporarily deprived [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]] of the [[List of rulers of Saxony|Saxon ducal title]] in 1112, Otto was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Saxony, which, however, he had to renounce shortly afterwards, as Lothair and Henry had reconciled. On the eve of the 1115 [[Battle of Welfesholz]], Otto campaigned the lands of the [[Polabian Slavs]], gaining large estates around [[Zerbst]] up to the [[Hevelli]] lands ruled by the [[Hevelli]] princes.\n\n===County of Anhalt===\nUntil his death in 1123, Count Otto had [[Anhalt Castle]] built in the [[Harz]] mountains near [[Harzgerode]] and appears to have been among the first to assume the title of a \"Count of Anhalt\". He was the father of [[Albert the Bear]], who temporarily was appointed Margrave of the Saxon Eastern March (or [[March of Lusatia]]) by the Saxon duke Lothair of Supplinburg and struggled for the ducal title himself. Albert could not prevail against the [[House of Welf|Welf]] duke [[Henry the Lion]], nevertheless he conquered the eastern territories of the former [[Northern March]], which had been lost in the 983 [[Great Slav Rising]], where he established the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157. When he died in 1170, his younger son Count [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernhard]] inherited the Ascanian home territories around Anhalt Castle and after the deposition of Henry the Lion by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] finally became Duke of Saxony in 1180. However, he effectively only ruled over the Eastphalian territories, while the [[Westphalia]]n and [[Engern]] parts of Saxony fell under the control of the [[Electorate of Cologne|Prince-Archbishops of Cologne]].\n\nThe County of Anhalt finally arose upon the death of Duke Bernhard in 1212, when his sons divided their heritage. The younger [[Albert I, Duke of Saxony|Albert I]] became Duke of Saxony, while the elder [[Henry I, Count of Anhalt|Henry I]] went on to rule the Ascanian lands, now definitely separated from Saxony, as Count of Anhalt. In 1218, Henry I assumed the title of a prince and thereby was the real founder of the princely [[House of Ascania|House of Anhalt]].\n\n=== Princes of Anhalt ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse (Herzog) von Anhalt.jpg|thumb|''Der Herzoge von Anhalte.'', [[Codex Manesse]], c. 1305/15]]\nOn Henry's death in 1252, his three sons partitioned the principality and founded, respectively, the lines of [[Anhalt-Aschersleben|Aschersleben]], [[Anhalt-Bernburg|Bernburg]] and [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Zerbst]].  The family ruling in Aschersleben became extinct in 1315, and this district was subsequently incorporated in the neighboring [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]], thus dividing the territory of [[Anhalt-Bernburg]] in two separate pieces.  The last prince of the original line of Anhalt-Bernburg died in 1468 and his lands were inherited by the princes of the sole remaining line, that of [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Anhalt-Zerbst]].  The territory belonging to this branch of the family had been divided in 1396, and after the acquisition of Bernburg Prince [[George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|George I]] made a further partition of Zerbst (Zerbst and Dessau). Early in the 16th century, however, owing to the death or abdication of several princes, the family had become narrowed down to the two branches of Anhalt-K\u00f6then and Anhalt-Dessau (issued both from Anhalt-Dessau in 1471).\n\n[[Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then|Wolfgang of Anhalt]], called ''the Confessor'', who became prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then in 1508, was the second ruler in the world to introduce the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] to his country. He was a co-signer of the [[Augsburg Confession]] in 1530, and after the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] in 1547 was placed under [[Imperial ban]] and deprived of his lands by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After the [[peace of Passau]] in 1552 he bought back his principality, but as he was childless he surrendered it in 1562 to his kinsmen the princes of Anhalt-Dessau. [[Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]] (d. 1516) left three sons, [[John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst|John V]], [[George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|George III]], and [[Joachim I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Joachim]], who ruled their lands together for many years, and who favoured the [[Lutheran]] doctrine, which thus became dominant in Anhalt. About 1546 the three brothers divided their principality and founded the lines of [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Zerbst]], [[Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau|Pl\u00f6tzkau]] and Dessau. This division, however, was only temporary, as the acquisition of [[Anhalt-K\u00f6then|K\u00f6then]], and a series of deaths among the ruling princes, enabled [[Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt|Joachim Ernest]], a son of John V, to unite the whole of Anhalt under his rule in 1570.\n\nThe first united [[principality]] of Anhalt was short-lived, and in 1603 it was split up into the mini states of Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-K\u00f6then, Anhalt-Zerbst and Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau.\n\nJoachim Ernest died in 1586, and his five sons ruled the land in common until 1603, when owing to the lack of [[primogeniture]], Anhalt was again divided, and the lines of Dessau, Bernburg, Pl\u00f6tzkau, Zerbst and K\u00f6then were re-founded.  The principality was ravaged during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and in the earlier part of this struggle [[Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg]] took an important part.  In 1635 an arrangement was made by the various princes of Anhalt, which gave a certain authority to the eldest member of the family, who was thus able to represent the principality as a whole.  This proceeding was probably due to the necessity of maintaining an appearance of unity in view of the disturbed state of European politics.\n[[File:Map of Anhalt (1747-1793).svg|thumb|Anhalt partitions 1747-1793]]\nIn 1665, the branch of Anhalt-K\u00f6then became extinct, and according to a family compact this district was inherited by [[Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then|Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau]], who surrendered Pl\u00f6tzkau to Bernburg, and took the title of prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then.  In the same year the princes of Anhalt decided that if any branch of the family became extinct its lands should be equally divided between the remaining branches.  This arrangement was carried out after the death of [[Frederick Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]] in 1793, and Zerbst was divided between the three remaining princes.  During these years the policy of the different princes was marked, perhaps intentionally, by considerable uniformity. Once or twice [[Calvinism]] was favoured by a prince, but in general the house was loyal to the doctrines of [[Martin Luther]].  The growth of [[Prussia]] provided Anhalt with a formidable neighbour, and the long-delayed establishment of primogeniture by all branches of the family prevented further divisions of the principality.\n\n===Dukes of Anhalt=== <!--[[Template:States of the Confederation of the Rhine]], [[Template:States of the German Confederation]] and [[Template:States of the North German Confederation]] link here-->\n{{main|Duchy of Anhalt}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Duchy of Anhalt.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the 19th-century Duchy of Anhalt.]]\nIn 1806, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] elevated the remaining states of Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-K\u00f6then to duchies; in the meantime, Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau and Anhalt-Zerbst had ceased to exist. These duchies were united again in 1863, due to the extinction of the K\u00f6then and Bernburg lines.  The new duchy consisted of two large portions, Eastern and Western Anhalt, separated by the interposition of a part of the Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] and of five [[exclave]]s surrounded by [[Prussia]]n territory: [[Alsleben]], [[Gro\u00dfm\u00fchlingen|M\u00fchlingen]], [[Dornburg]], [[G\u00f6dnitz]] and [[Abberode|Tilkerode-Abberode]]. The eastern and larger portion of the duchy was enclosed by the Prussian government district of [[Potsdam]] (in the Prussian province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]) and by [[Magdeburg]] and [[Merseburg]], belonging to the Prussian province of Saxony. The western or smaller portion, the so-called Upper Duchy or [[Ballenstedt]], was also enclosed by the two latter districts as well as by the Duchy of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nWhen a united state, the capital of Anhalt was [[Dessau]].\n\nAlong with the fall of all German monarchies, the Duchy of Anhalt came to an end in 1918\u201319 during [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|the revolution that followed]] the end of [[World War I]]. It was replaced by the [[Free State of Anhalt]] within the [[Weimar Republic]]. After [[World War II]], the Free State was united with the Prussian parts of Saxony to form [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. Subsequently, Saxony-Anhalt was dissolved in 1952, but re-established prior to the [[German reunification]] in 1990, since when it has been one of the sixteen [[States of Germany|''(Bundes)l\u00e4nder'']] (states) of [[Germany]].\n\n==== Constitution ====\nThe duchy, by virtue of a fundamental law, proclaimed on September 17, 1859 and subsequently modified by various [[decree]]s, was a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The duke, who bore the title of \"Highness\", wielded the executive power while sharing the [[legislation]] with the [[Estates of the realm|estates]].  The [[diet (assembly)|diet]] ([[Landtag]]) was composed of thirty-six members, of whom two were appointed by the duke, eight were representatives of landowners paying the highest taxes, two of the highest assessed members of the commercial and manufacturing classes, fourteen of the other [[Voting|electors]] of the towns and ten of the rural districts.  The representatives were chosen for six years by indirect vote and must have completed their twenty-fifth year.  The duke governed through a [[minister of state]], who was the praeses of all the departments&nbsp;\u2014 finance, home affairs, education, public worship and statistics.\n\n== Population ==\nIn 1905 the population of the Duchy of Anhalt was 328,007, a ratio of about 351 to the square mile (909&nbsp;km\u00b2). The country was divided into the districts of [[Dessau]], [[K\u00f6then]], [[Zerbst]], [[Bernburg]] and [[Ballenstedt]], of which that of Bernburg was the most, and that of Ballenstedt the least, populated. Of the towns, four, viz. Dessau, Bernburg, K\u00f6then and Zerbst, had populations exceeding 20,000.\n\nThe inhabitants of the duchy, with the exception of about 12,000 [[Roman Catholic]]s and 1700 [[Jew]]s, were members of the [[Evangelical State Church of Anhalt]]. The supreme ecclesiastical authority was the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]] in Dessau; while a [[synod]] of 39 members, elected for six years, assembled at periods to deliberate on internal matters touching the organization of the church. The Roman Catholics were under the [[bishop of Paderborn]].\n\n== Rulers of Anhalt ==\n\n===[[House of Ascania]]===\n\n====Partitions of Anhalt under Ascanian rule====\n\n{|align=\"center\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px; border: 1px solid black; text-align: center;\"\n|+ \n|- \n| colspan=10 style=\"background: #fff;\" |'''County of Anhalt'''<br>(1030-1212)\n|- \n| colspan=10 style=\"background: #fff;\" |'''Principality of Anhalt'''<br>(1212-1252)\n|- \n| colspan=4 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #eca;\" |'''Anhalt-Zerbst'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1252-1396)\n| colspan=5 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #cef;\" |'''Anhalt-Bernburg'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1252-1468)\n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #ceb;\" |'''Anhalt-Aschersleben'''<br>(1252-1315)\n|- \n| colspan=1 rowspan=\"12\" style=\"background: #eee;\" |''Annexed to <br>[[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]''\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ccf;\" |'''Anhalt-K\u00f6then'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1396-1562)\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #cea;\" |'''Anhalt-Dessau'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1396-1561)\n|- \n| colspan=7 style=\"background: #cea;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Dessau---> \n|- \n| colspan=5 style=\"background: #cea;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Dessau---> \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #eca;\" |'''Anhalt-Zerbst'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1544-1562)\n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #AaCcBb;\" |'''Anhalt-Plotzkau'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1544-1553)\n|- \n| colspan=5 style=\"background: #cea;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Dessau---> \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #eca;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Zerbst---> \n|- \n| colspan=7 style=\"background: #eca;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Zerbst---> \n|- \n| colspan=9 style=\"background: #fff;\" |'''Principality of Anhalt'''<br><small>''(from Anhalt-Zerbst line)''</small><br>(1562-1603)\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #ccf;\" |'''Anhalt-K\u00f6then'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1603-1847)\n| colspan=1 style=\"background:#AaCcBb;\" |'''Anhalt-Plotzkau'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1603-1665)\n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #cea;\" |'''Anhalt-Dessau'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1603-1863)\n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #eca;\" |'''Anhalt-Zerbst'''<br><small>(3rd creation)</small><br>(1603-1793)\n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #cef;\" |'''Anhalt-Bernburg'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1603-1863)\n|- \n| colspan=3 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ccf;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---K\u00f6then---> \n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #cea;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Dessau---> \n|- \n| colspan=7 style=\"background: #cea;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Dessau---> \n|- \n| colspan=9 style=\"background: #fff;\" |'''Duchy of Anhalt'''<br><small>''(from Anhalt-Dessau line)''</small><br>(1863-1918)\n|}\n\n====Table of rulers====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n! colspan=2 | Ruler!!Born!!Reign!!Death!!Ruling part!!Consort!!Notes\n|-bgcolor=#fff\n|[[Esico of Ballenstedt|Esico]]||||?||c.1030-1060||1060||[[County of Anhalt|Anhalt]] || Matilda of Swabia<br/>before 1060<br/>one child|| First known ruler of the lands of Anhalt.

Ruled by Ascanian princes from the [[High Middle Ages]] to the [[Early modern period]], Anhalt was divided several times amongst various lines of the dynasty until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806, when [[Napoleon]] elevated the remaining states of [[Anhalt-Bernburg]], [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and [[Anhalt-K\u00f6then]] to duchies.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Anhalt territory stretched from the [[Harz]] mountain range in the west to the [[Elbe]] River and beyond to the [[Fl\u00e4ming Heath]] in the east. Upon the 1315 loss of [[Principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben|Anhalt-Aschersleben]], the lands around Ballenstedt formed a western [[enclave and exclave|exclave]]. The area of the later duchy was 906 miles\u00b2 (2300&nbsp;km\u00b2).\n\nIn the west, the land is undulating and in the extreme northwest, where it forms part of the Harz mountains, hilly, with the [[Ramberg (Harz)]] peak as the tallest point at 1,900&nbsp;ft (579 m). From the Harz the country gently shelves down to the [[Saale]]; the land between this river and the Elbe is particularly fertile. East of the Elbe, the land is mostly a flat sandy plain, with extensive [[pine]] forests, interspersed with bog-land and rich pastures. The Elbe is the chief river, intersecting the eastern portion of the former duchy, from east to west, and at [[Rosslau]] is met by the [[Mulde]].  The navigable Saale takes a northerly direction through the central portion of the territory and receives, on the right, the [[Fuhne]] and, on the left, the [[Wipper (Saale)|Wipper]] and the [[Bode (Wipper)|Bode]].\n\nThe climate is generally mild, less so in the higher Harz regions to the south-west.\n\n== History ==\nFrom the 9th century onward, the western parts of the later Anhalt territory up to the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers were included in the ''[[Schwabengau]]'' region of [[Eastphalia]], the eastern part of the medieval Duchy of Saxony. In the 11th century, it came under the rule of Count [[Esico of Ballenstedt]] (died 1059 or 1060), mentioned in a 1036 deed issued by Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] at [[Tilleda]]. Possibly a descendant of the Saxon margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo]], he owned large [[allod]]ial lands around [[Ballenstedt]] in the ''Schwabengau'' as well as in the adjacent ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' Serimunt in the former [[Saxon Eastern March]]. \n[[File:SchlossBallenstedt2005.jpg|thumb|Ballenstedt Castle]]\nCount Esico was succeeded by his son [[Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt|Adalbert II of Ballenstedt]], who also appeared as a count in the Saxon [[Nordth\u00fcringgau]] and further territories in the Eastern March. Adalbert joined the [[Saxon Rebellion]] against King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and was slain in a feud with [[Egeno II of Konradsburg]] in 1180. His son Count [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt|Otto the Rich]] appeared as a \"Count of Ballenstedt\" from 1106. When Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] temporarily deprived [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair of Supplinburg]] of the [[List of rulers of Saxony|Saxon ducal title]] in 1112, Otto was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Saxony, which, however, he had to renounce shortly afterwards, as Lothair and Henry had reconciled. On the eve of the 1115 [[Battle of Welfesholz]], Otto campaigned the lands of the [[Polabian Slavs]], gaining large estates around [[Zerbst]] up to the [[Hevelli]] lands ruled by the [[Hevelli]] princes.\n\n===County of Anhalt===\nUntil his death in 1123, Count Otto had [[Anhalt Castle]] built in the [[Harz]] mountains near [[Harzgerode]] and appears to have been among the first to assume the title of a \"Count of Anhalt\". He was the father of [[Albert the Bear]], who temporarily was appointed Margrave of the Saxon Eastern March (or [[March of Lusatia]]) by the Saxon duke Lothair of Supplinburg and struggled for the ducal title himself. Albert could not prevail against the [[House of Welf|Welf]] duke [[Henry the Lion]], nevertheless he conquered the eastern territories of the former [[Northern March]], which had been lost in the 983 [[Great Slav Rising]], where he established the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157. When he died in 1170, his younger son Count [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernhard]] inherited the Ascanian home territories around Anhalt Castle and after the deposition of Henry the Lion by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] finally became Duke of Saxony in 1180. However, he effectively only ruled over the Eastphalian territories, while the [[Westphalia]]n and [[Engern]] parts of Saxony fell under the control of the [[Electorate of Cologne|Prince-Archbishops of Cologne]].\n\nThe County of Anhalt finally arose upon the death of Duke Bernhard in 1212, when his sons divided their heritage. The younger [[Albert I, Duke of Saxony|Albert I]] became Duke of Saxony, while the elder [[Henry I, Count of Anhalt|Henry I]] went on to rule the Ascanian lands, now definitely separated from Saxony, as Count of Anhalt. In 1218, Henry I assumed the title of a prince and thereby was the real founder of the princely [[House of Ascania|House of Anhalt]].\n\n=== Princes of Anhalt ===\n[[File:Codex Manesse (Herzog) von Anhalt.jpg|thumb|''Der Herzoge von Anhalte.'', [[Codex Manesse]], c. 1305/15]]\nOn Henry's death in 1252, his three sons partitioned the principality and founded, respectively, the lines of [[Anhalt-Aschersleben|Aschersleben]], [[Anhalt-Bernburg|Bernburg]] and [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Zerbst]].  The family ruling in Aschersleben became extinct in 1315, and this district was subsequently incorporated in the neighboring [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]], thus dividing the territory of [[Anhalt-Bernburg]] in two separate pieces.  The last prince of the original line of Anhalt-Bernburg died in 1468 and his lands were inherited by the princes of the sole remaining line, that of [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Anhalt-Zerbst]].  The territory belonging to this branch of the family had been divided in 1396, and after the acquisition of Bernburg Prince [[George I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|George I]] made a further partition of Zerbst (Zerbst and Dessau). Early in the 16th century, however, owing to the death or abdication of several princes, the family had become narrowed down to the two branches of Anhalt-K\u00f6then and Anhalt-Dessau (issued both from Anhalt-Dessau in 1471).\n\n[[Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then|Wolfgang of Anhalt]], called ''the Confessor'', who became prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then in 1508, was the second ruler in the world to introduce the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] to his country. He was a co-signer of the [[Augsburg Confession]] in 1530, and after the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] in 1547 was placed under [[Imperial ban]] and deprived of his lands by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After the [[peace of Passau]] in 1552 he bought back his principality, but as he was childless he surrendered it in 1562 to his kinsmen the princes of Anhalt-Dessau. [[Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]] (d. 1516) left three sons, [[John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst|John V]], [[George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|George III]], and [[Joachim I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Joachim]], who ruled their lands together for many years, and who favoured the [[Lutheran]] doctrine, which thus became dominant in Anhalt. About 1546 the three brothers divided their principality and founded the lines of [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Zerbst]], [[Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau|Pl\u00f6tzkau]] and Dessau. This division, however, was only temporary, as the acquisition of [[Anhalt-K\u00f6then|K\u00f6then]], and a series of deaths among the ruling princes, enabled [[Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt|Joachim Ernest]], a son of John V, to unite the whole of Anhalt under his rule in 1570.\n\nThe first united [[principality]] of Anhalt was short-lived, and in 1603 it was split up into the mini states of Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-K\u00f6then, Anhalt-Zerbst and Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau.\n\nJoachim Ernest died in 1586, and his five sons ruled the land in common until 1603, when owing to the lack of [[primogeniture]], Anhalt was again divided, and the lines of Dessau, Bernburg, Pl\u00f6tzkau, Zerbst and K\u00f6then were re-founded.  The principality was ravaged during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and in the earlier part of this struggle [[Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg]] took an important part.  In 1635 an arrangement was made by the various princes of Anhalt, which gave a certain authority to the eldest member of the family, who was thus able to represent the principality as a whole.  This proceeding was probably due to the necessity of maintaining an appearance of unity in view of the disturbed state of European politics.\n[[File:Map of Anhalt (1747-1793).svg|thumb|Anhalt partitions 1747-1793]]\nIn 1665, the branch of Anhalt-K\u00f6then became extinct, and according to a family compact this district was inherited by [[Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then|Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau]], who surrendered Pl\u00f6tzkau to Bernburg, and took the title of prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then.  In the same year the princes of Anhalt decided that if any branch of the family became extinct its lands should be equally divided between the remaining branches.  This arrangement was carried out after the death of [[Frederick Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]] in 1793, and Zerbst was divided between the three remaining princes.  During these years the policy of the different princes was marked, perhaps intentionally, by considerable uniformity. Once or twice [[Calvinism]] was favoured by a prince, but in general the house was loyal to the doctrines of [[Martin Luther]].  The growth of [[Prussia]] provided Anhalt with a formidable neighbour, and the long-delayed establishment of primogeniture by all branches of the family prevented further divisions of the principality.\n\n===Dukes of Anhalt=== <!--[[Template:States of the Confederation of the Rhine]], [[Template:States of the German Confederation]] and [[Template:States of the North German Confederation]] link here-->\n{{main|Duchy of Anhalt}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Duchy of Anhalt.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of the 19th-century Duchy of Anhalt.]]\nIn 1806, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] elevated the remaining states of Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-K\u00f6then to duchies; in the meantime, Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau and Anhalt-Zerbst had ceased to exist. These duchies were united again in 1863, due to the extinction of the K\u00f6then and Bernburg lines.  The new duchy consisted of two large portions, Eastern and Western Anhalt, separated by the interposition of a part of the Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] and of five [[exclave]]s surrounded by [[Prussia]]n territory: [[Alsleben]], [[Gro\u00dfm\u00fchlingen|M\u00fchlingen]], [[Dornburg]], [[G\u00f6dnitz]] and [[Abberode|Tilkerode-Abberode]]. The eastern and larger portion of the duchy was enclosed by the Prussian government district of [[Potsdam]] (in the Prussian province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]) and by [[Magdeburg]] and [[Merseburg]], belonging to the Prussian province of Saxony. The western or smaller portion, the so-called Upper Duchy or [[Ballenstedt]], was also enclosed by the two latter districts as well as by the Duchy of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nWhen a united state, the capital of Anhalt was [[Dessau]].\n\nAlong with the fall of all German monarchies, the Duchy of Anhalt came to an end in 1918\u201319 during [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|the revolution that followed]] the end of [[World War I]]. It was replaced by the [[Free State of Anhalt]] within the [[Weimar Republic]]. After [[World War II]], the Free State was united with the Prussian parts of Saxony to form [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. Subsequently, Saxony-Anhalt was dissolved in 1952, but re-established prior to the [[German reunification]] in 1990, since when it has been one of the sixteen [[States of Germany|''(Bundes)l\u00e4nder'']] (states) of [[Germany]].\n\n==== Constitution ====\nThe duchy, by virtue of a fundamental law, proclaimed on September 17, 1859 and subsequently modified by various [[decree]]s, was a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The duke, who bore the title of \"Highness\", wielded the executive power while sharing the [[legislation]] with the [[Estates of the realm|estates]].  The [[diet (assembly)|diet]] ([[Landtag]]) was composed of thirty-six members, of whom two were appointed by the duke, eight were representatives of landowners paying the highest taxes, two of the highest assessed members of the commercial and manufacturing classes, fourteen of the other [[Voting|electors]] of the towns and ten of the rural districts.  The representatives were chosen for six years by indirect vote and must have completed their twenty-fifth year.  The duke governed through a [[minister of state]], who was the praeses of all the departments&nbsp;\u2014 finance, home affairs, education, public worship and statistics.\n\n== Population ==\nIn 1905 the population of the Duchy of Anhalt was 328,007, a ratio of about 351 to the square mile (909&nbsp;km\u00b2). The country was divided into the districts of [[Dessau]], [[K\u00f6then]], [[Zerbst]], [[Bernburg]] and [[Ballenstedt]], of which that of Bernburg was the most, and that of Ballenstedt the least, populated. Of the towns, four, viz.

On a high [[schist]] ridge that rises {{convert|200|ft|m}} above the [[Hudson River]] from [[Dyckman Street]] to the northern tip of the island, Inwood Hill Park's densely folded, glacially scoured topography contains the largest remaining [[old-growth forest]] on Manhattan Island. Unlike other Manhattan parks, Inwood Hill Park is largely natural and consists of mostly wooded, non-landscaped hills.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Site ===\n[[File:Shorakkopoch Rock.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Shorakkopoch Rock]]\n[[File:Inwoodhillpark.jpg|jpg|thumb|left|267px|Looking at the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]] from the park along the [[Harlem River]]]]\n[[File:WPA workers Inwood Hill Park (1938).jpg|thumb|left|267px|[[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] workers constructing a paved pathway in Inwood Hill Park (1938)]]\n\nInwood Hill Park has a human history that goes back to the [[Pre-Columbian era]]. Through the 17th century, Native Americans known as the [[Lenape]] inhabited the area. There is evidence of a main encampment along the eastern edge of the park. The Lenape relied on both the Hudson and Harlem Rivers as sources for food. Artifacts and the remains of old campfires were found in Inwood's rock shelters, suggesting their use for shelter and temporary living quarters. Legend has it that under a [[tulip tree]] in the park [[Peter Minuit]], Director General of New Netherland, purchased Manhattan from the a band of Native Americans in 1626 for the Dutch West India Company; the purchase price being a shipment of goods worth 60 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]]. The tree, the largest tulip on the island, survived for centuries until it was felled by a storm in 1933. Until the 1950s the base of the tree under which this transaction allegedly took place was still to be seen, surrounded by a large iron fence, but as it rotted it was finally removed and a boulder (Shorakkopoch Rock) and plaque replaced it.\n\n[[Fort Cockhill]], one of many forts built in New York by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, stood slightly north from the center of Inwood Hill Park. A small, five-sided earthen structure equipped with two cannons, it overlooked the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek at its confluence with the Hudson River. At the time, the area was known from Colonial to post\u2013Revolutionary War times as ''Cox's Hill'' or ''Tubby Hook Hill''.\n\nEven though the area which is now Inwood Hill Park was the site of one of the last farms in Manhattan \u2013 which lasted to at least c. 1890<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, p. 9</ref> \u2013 by the 19th century it was largely the location of country retreats for some of the wealthier families of the community and the rest of New York's social elite.<ref>{{cite news|author=Unknown|url=http://myinwood.net/inwood-in-1886/|title=Big Woods Right In Town (Inwood in 1886)|newspaper=[[New York World]]|date=December 26, 1886}}</ref> One such notable who had a summer estate in Inwood was [[Isidor Straus]], co-owner of the [[Macy's]] department store and a passenger on the ill-fated voyage of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].

Additionally, an [[orphanage]] was located high on a bluff in what is now Inwood Hill Park in the nineteenth century. The site today includes a small paved area and park benches; no trace of the building remains. At least three freshwater springs arise in the park, one of which was used for drinking water by the workers who constructed the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]].\n\n=== Use as park ===\n[[Andrew Haswell Green]], who was in charge of the [[Central Park Commissioner|Central Park Commission]], and responsible for laying out the streets on the [[Upper West Side]] and in [[Upper Manhattan]], first suggested that a park be created in Inwood in 1895.  His idea did not gain traction quickly, but the discovery of archeological finds in the area, the unique geology of the hill, historical associations (both true and merely rumored), the inherent beauty of the landscape and the views to be seen from it finally brought the city around,<ref name=concrete3637>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp. 36\u201337</ref> and between 1915 and the early 1940s, it purchased parcels of land that make up the park as it is today.\n\nThe park was officially opened on May 8, 1926.  Squatters who lived in the abandoned estates around the perimeter of the park were removed in the 1930s by [[Robert Moses]] and the [[Works Project Administration]].  The WPA also paved over some trails and illuminated them with lampposts, many of which are now in need of repair. Arson and dumping have damaged the park and its integrity, as have erosion-control measures which were not well conceived.<ref name=concrete3637 />\n\nOn September 15, 1995, the Inwood Hill Nature Center was dedicated and opened to the public. It is located near the park entrance on 218th Street and Indian Road. The center is located on Manhattan's only salt-water marsh, and has been designated as an interactive exhibit with ongoing monitoring of the natural area. It is also the focal point to watch the eagles that have been placed in the park to be freed when they are able to adjust to the environment.<ref>Renner, James (September 2003) [http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html \"Inwood Hill Park\"] ''Washington Heights & Inwood Onine'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902033654/http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html |date=September 2, 2010 }}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe park covers {{convert|196.4|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"NYC Parks\">{{cite web |title= Inwood Hill Park |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/inwoodhillpark |publisher= New York City Department of Parks and Recreation |accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> The [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Empire Connection]] run through it, and at its northern end the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]] and the rail-only [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]] link Manhattan to the Bronx.\n\nThe park's western boundary is the Hudson River, and the southern boundary is Dyckman Street.

These waterfowl can be studied further via educational programs held at the Nature Center at the north end of the property. [[Mallard]]s, [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[ring-billed gull]]s are year-round residents, using both the water and the nearby lawns and ballfields. Many wading birds and waterfowl pass through on the spring and fall migrations, and [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s often spend the summer.  Also in the [[salt marsh]] can be found fish, [[mollusks]] and [[crustaceans]] among the [[cordgrass]] and [[bulrush]]es which can tolerate both salt and fresh water.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\">Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35</ref>\n\nThe woods support a wide variety of birds, including common species such as [[blue jay]]s and [[Northern cardinal|cardinals]], as well as [[wild turkey]]s. [[bird of prey|Birds of prey]] that breed in the park include [[red-tailed hawk]]s and [[owl]]s. A five-year project that began in summer 2002 attempted to reintroduce the [[bald eagle]] to Manhattan using [[Hack (falconry)|hacking]] boxes in the park and eaglets brought in from the Midwest. In the first summer, three of the four introduced eaglets fledged successfully; three or four fledged each year of the program.<ref>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/urban_park_rangers/eaglecam/blog/index.html City of New York/Parks and Recreation Eagles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The nesting structure was removed in 2009.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThe park also sustains many types of trees and flowers which are no longer extant elsewhere on Manhattan Island, such as ''Dicentra cucullaria'', or \"Dutchman's breeches\". In 1918, Arthur Graves, then of the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and later a curator at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], found in the park a species of [[chestnut tree]] which was resistant to a blight which was then attacking the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of chestnut trees.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.32-26</ref>\n\nAnimals found in the park include Eastern and [[meadow vole]]s, red-bellied [[salamander]]s, [[southern flying squirrel]]s, [[opossum]]s, white-footed [[deer mice]], and [[cottontail rabbit]]s, as well as the expected [[eastern grey squirrel]]s and [[raccoon]]s. [[Foxes]] were also once residents, but the increasing number of [[coyote]]s spotted in [[Central Park]] and in the Bronx's [[Van Cortlandt Park]] may account for the foxes' apparent current absence.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThough the park does not support large wild mammals, the local wildlife does include raccoons and skunks as well as the usual city rodents. Both locals and people from outside the neighborhood fish from the riverbank at the north end of the park.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe park contains three children's [[playground]]s, baseball and soccer fields, and tennis and basketball courts.<ref name=\"Yarrow 1987\"/> The Inwood Hill Nature Center at the north end of the park is both a location for educational programs and the local headquarters of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation#Urban Park Rangers|Urban Park Rangers]]. Inwood Hill Park's ballfields are heavily used by local and other city Spanish-language leagues during the baseball season. This usage places extreme pressure on the park, which, as a result, has required more active management in recent years.\n\nThe lack of green space in the eastern part of Inwood and [[the Bronx]] nearby creates an enormous demand for picnicking with barbecues and table/chair setups, activity that is either illegal or tightly controlled in most city parks; however, Inwood Hill Park has managed this by permitting such setups on the manicured, maintained peninsula portion of the park.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Panorama\n | image      = File:Inwood Hill Park Panorama.jpg\n | caption    = <div align=center>Panorama of the park in fall</div>\n | height     = 180\n}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite concrete}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Inwood Hill Park}}\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/park_info_pages/park_info.php?propID=M042 NYC Parks: Inwood Hill Park]\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Protected areas of New York City}}\n\n[[Category:Inwood, Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Nature centers in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parks in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Urban public parks]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Works Progress Administration in New York City]]\n[[Category:Harlem River]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{short description|Public park in Manhattan, New York}}\n{{coord|40.872458|-73.925886|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Infobox park\n| name = Inwood Hill Park\n| photo = Native Caves.jpg\n| photo_width = 225px\n| photo_caption = Native American caves\n| type = [[Urban park]]\n| location = [[Inwood, Manhattan]], [[New York City]]\n| area = {{convert|196.4|acre|ha}}\n| created = 1926\n| operator = [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]\n}}\n\n'''Inwood Hill Park''' is a public [[park]] in the [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], operated by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

His idea did not gain traction quickly, but the discovery of archeological finds in the area, the unique geology of the hill, historical associations (both true and merely rumored), the inherent beauty of the landscape and the views to be seen from it finally brought the city around,<ref name=concrete3637>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp. 36\u201337</ref> and between 1915 and the early 1940s, it purchased parcels of land that make up the park as it is today.\n\nThe park was officially opened on May 8, 1926.  Squatters who lived in the abandoned estates around the perimeter of the park were removed in the 1930s by [[Robert Moses]] and the [[Works Project Administration]].  The WPA also paved over some trails and illuminated them with lampposts, many of which are now in need of repair. Arson and dumping have damaged the park and its integrity, as have erosion-control measures which were not well conceived.<ref name=concrete3637 />\n\nOn September 15, 1995, the Inwood Hill Nature Center was dedicated and opened to the public. It is located near the park entrance on 218th Street and Indian Road. The center is located on Manhattan's only salt-water marsh, and has been designated as an interactive exhibit with ongoing monitoring of the natural area. It is also the focal point to watch the eagles that have been placed in the park to be freed when they are able to adjust to the environment.<ref>Renner, James (September 2003) [http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html \"Inwood Hill Park\"] ''Washington Heights & Inwood Onine'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902033654/http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html |date=September 2, 2010 }}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe park covers {{convert|196.4|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"NYC Parks\">{{cite web |title= Inwood Hill Park |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/inwoodhillpark |publisher= New York City Department of Parks and Recreation |accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> The [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Empire Connection]] run through it, and at its northern end the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]] and the rail-only [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]] link Manhattan to the Bronx.\n\nThe park's western boundary is the Hudson River, and the southern boundary is Dyckman Street. From [[Dyckman Street (Manhattan)|Dyckman Street]] to 204th Street the eastern boundary is Payson Avenue, from 204th to 214th Street it is Seaman Avenue, and from 215th Street to the park's end at 218th Street the eastern boundary is Indian Road.<ref name=\"NYC Parks\"/> {{convert|10|mi}} footpaths criss-cross the park, allowing easy access to Dyckman Street, [[Fort Tryon Park]], [[Fort Washington Park (Manhattan)|Fort Washington Park]], and [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] \u2013 part of the [[Manhattan Waterfront Greenway]].

These waterfowl can be studied further via educational programs held at the Nature Center at the north end of the property. [[Mallard]]s, [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[ring-billed gull]]s are year-round residents, using both the water and the nearby lawns and ballfields. Many wading birds and waterfowl pass through on the spring and fall migrations, and [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s often spend the summer.  Also in the [[salt marsh]] can be found fish, [[mollusks]] and [[crustaceans]] among the [[cordgrass]] and [[bulrush]]es which can tolerate both salt and fresh water.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\">Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35</ref>\n\nThe woods support a wide variety of birds, including common species such as [[blue jay]]s and [[Northern cardinal|cardinals]], as well as [[wild turkey]]s. [[bird of prey|Birds of prey]] that breed in the park include [[red-tailed hawk]]s and [[owl]]s. A five-year project that began in summer 2002 attempted to reintroduce the [[bald eagle]] to Manhattan using [[Hack (falconry)|hacking]] boxes in the park and eaglets brought in from the Midwest. In the first summer, three of the four introduced eaglets fledged successfully; three or four fledged each year of the program.<ref>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/urban_park_rangers/eaglecam/blog/index.html City of New York/Parks and Recreation Eagles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The nesting structure was removed in 2009.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThe park also sustains many types of trees and flowers which are no longer extant elsewhere on Manhattan Island, such as ''Dicentra cucullaria'', or \"Dutchman's breeches\". In 1918, Arthur Graves, then of the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and later a curator at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], found in the park a species of [[chestnut tree]] which was resistant to a blight which was then attacking the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of chestnut trees.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.32-26</ref>\n\nAnimals found in the park include Eastern and [[meadow vole]]s, red-bellied [[salamander]]s, [[southern flying squirrel]]s, [[opossum]]s, white-footed [[deer mice]], and [[cottontail rabbit]]s, as well as the expected [[eastern grey squirrel]]s and [[raccoon]]s. [[Foxes]] were also once residents, but the increasing number of [[coyote]]s spotted in [[Central Park]] and in the Bronx's [[Van Cortlandt Park]] may account for the foxes' apparent current absence.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThough the park does not support large wild mammals, the local wildlife does include raccoons and skunks as well as the usual city rodents. Both locals and people from outside the neighborhood fish from the riverbank at the north end of the park.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe park contains three children's [[playground]]s, baseball and soccer fields, and tennis and basketball courts.<ref name=\"Yarrow 1987\"/> The Inwood Hill Nature Center at the north end of the park is both a location for educational programs and the local headquarters of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation#Urban Park Rangers|Urban Park Rangers]]. Inwood Hill Park's ballfields are heavily used by local and other city Spanish-language leagues during the baseball season. This usage places extreme pressure on the park, which, as a result, has required more active management in recent years.\n\nThe lack of green space in the eastern part of Inwood and [[the Bronx]] nearby creates an enormous demand for picnicking with barbecues and table/chair setups, activity that is either illegal or tightly controlled in most city parks; however, Inwood Hill Park has managed this by permitting such setups on the manicured, maintained peninsula portion of the park.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Panorama\n | image      = File:Inwood Hill Park Panorama.jpg\n | caption    = <div align=center>Panorama of the park in fall</div>\n | height     = 180\n}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite concrete}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Inwood Hill Park}}\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/park_info_pages/park_info.php?propID=M042 NYC Parks: Inwood Hill Park]\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Protected areas of New York City}}\n\n[[Category:Inwood, Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Nature centers in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parks in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Urban public parks]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Works Progress Administration in New York City]]\n[[Category:Harlem River]]\n", "name_user": "HaileJones", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed Passive voice from tulip tree description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwood_Hill_Park"}
