Chamberlain began his career as a youth player with Middlesex and London and gained youth international honours for his country. He joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1952, where he made 204 first team appearances, scoring 64 goals before leaving for [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in 1965. He finished his professional career at [[Gravesend and Northfleet F.C.|Gravesend and Northfleet]].\n\n==Career==\n\nChamberlain was born in King Cross, London., and as a youth joined the local boys club, The Mary Ward Settlement in [[Bloomsbury]], where he played in the London Federation of Boys Club Leagues. He was also a schoolboy international before signing for Fulham. After spending his youth career in London and Middlesex, Chamberlain signed for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1954, encouraging his schoolboy friend [[Johnny Haynes]] to join him there. He made his debut in November that year. Two years later after his National Service, in Chamberlain's first team game in 1954, with his first kick in the very first minute, he scored a goal against Lincoln City. Next season, he even postponed his wedding day in order to play against Newcastle United in pouring rain in the 4th round of the F.A. Cup. Tosh scored a hat trick (and possibly a fourth, which was controversially given offside) and in the best tradition of Fulham's greatest games, they eventually lost, 4\u20135. His last game was in a FA Cup 3rd round replay at Millwall on 11 January 1965.\n\n==Playing style and legacy==\nTrevor was a maverick of a player on the left wing and much loved by Fulham supporters - because he wasn't 'perfect'. He made a great partnership on the field with his long-term friend Johnny Haynes. Tosh was renowned for his thunderous kick, a toe-punt once caught by [[Gordon Banks]] forced him over the goalline, causing an own goal. Another time, a back pass to his goalie, [[Tony Macedo]] resulted in broken ribs. He famously stopped in mid game once in order to ask for a quick puff from a supporter's cigarette, before continuing play.\n\nHe was one of the most beloved of all the Fulham characters (along with Johnny Haynes and Jimmy Hill) of the 1950s and 1960s and his exploits thrilled the fans as much as they often exasperated Haynes, who was always a perfectionist. As Max Miller might have said, \"There'll never be another\".\n\n==Since retirement==\nSince retiring from football, Chamberlain worked for [[Richmond Park]] authorities in the 1980s and '90s. He also worked as a sports instructor at [[Elliott School]] in [[Putney]]. He is frequently seen at Craven Cottage and continues to support Fulham FC.\n\n[[File:Tosh Chamberlain.jpg|thumb|Tosh in recent years]]\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cc.fulhamfc.com/forum/topics/the-50-greatest-fulham-players?xg_source=activity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722031529/http://cc.fulhamfc.com/forum/topics/the-50-greatest-fulham-players?xg_source=activity |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

Researchers believe that most cases of arachnoid cysts are developmental malformations that arise from the unexplained splitting or tearing of the arachnoid membrane.\n\nIn some cases, arachnoid cysts occurring in the middle fossa are accompanied by underdevelopment ([[hypoplasia]]) or compression of the [[temporal lobe]]. The exact role that temporal lobe abnormalities play in the development of [[middle fossa]] arachnoid cysts is unknown.\n\nThere are some cases where hereditary disorders have been connected with arachnoid cysts.<ref name=\"pmid7490613\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schievink WI, Huston J, Torres VE, Marsh WR | title = Intracranial cysts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease | journal = J.

Blood vessels on the surface of a cyst may tear and bleed into the cyst (intracystic [[hemorrhage]]), increasing its size. If a blood vessel bleeds on the outside of a cyst, a collection of blood ([[hematoma]]) may result. In the cases of intracystic hemorrhage and hematoma, the individual may have symptoms of increased pressure within the cranium and signs of compression of nearby nerve (neural) tissue.\n\nSome scientists debate whether arachnoid cysts are a true congenite condition or if this should be separated from secondary cysts.<ref name=\"pmid22411232\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Westermaier T, Schweitzer T, Ernestus RI | title = Arachnoid cysts | journal = Adv.

It was conceived by Professor Tim Lang<ref>http://www.city.ac.uk/communityandhealth/phpcfp/foodpolicy/index.html.  He explains its history in this article Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)\u2019, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97</ref> at the Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment (SAFE) Alliance<ref>The SAFE Alliance merged with the National Food Alliance in 1999 to become Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming http://www.sustainweb.org/.

Learning in sustainable agriculture: Food miles and missing objects. Environmental Values, 14, 163-83</ref>\n\nSome scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the [[globalization]] of trade; the focus of food supply bases into fewer, larger districts; drastic changes in delivery patterns; the increase in processed and packaged foods; and making fewer trips to the supermarket.  These make a small part of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions created by food; 83% of overall emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> are in production phases.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = C.\n | last2 = Matthews | first2 = H. | year = 2008\n | title = Food-Miles and the Relative Climate Impacts of Food Choices in the United States | url =\n | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 42 | issue = 10| pages = 3508\u20133513\n | doi=10.1021/es702969f| doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\nSeveral studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle, including production, consumption, and transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/ww/localfood|title=Sources and Resources for \"Local Food: The Economics\" - Worldwatch Institute|date=|website=www.worldwatch.org|access-date=April 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404015748/http://www.worldwatch.org/ww/localfood|archive-date=April 4, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> These include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas 'up to the farm gate' versus 'beyond the farm gate'.  In the UK, for example, agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40% of the overall food chain (including retail, packaging, fertilizer manufacture, and other factors), whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12% of overall food-chain emissions.<ref>(Garnett 2011, Food Policy)</ref>  Researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information.\n\nThe concept of \"food miles\" has been criticised, and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production. In comparison, the percentage of total energy used in home food preparation is 26% and in food processing is 29%, far greater than transportation.<ref>John Hendrickson, \"Energy use in the U.S. Food System: A summary of existing research and analysis.\" Sustainable Farming (Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec), vol. 7, no. 4. Fall 1997.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of [[sustainability]] which deals with a large range of environmental, social and economic issues, including [[local food]]. The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, [[City University, London]]) who says: \"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations.\"<ref>Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)\u2019, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97</ref>  The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961.<ref>Erik Millstone and Tim Lang, The Atlas of Food, Earthscan, London, 1963, p. 60.</ref> Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions.\n\nAlthough it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a [[DEFRA]] report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at [[AEA Technology]] Environment, entitled ''The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development'', included findings that \"the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over \u00a39 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion.\"<ref>Smith, A. et al. (2005) The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development: Final report. DEFRA, London.

Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling.

However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number \u2013 although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable \u2013 or not \u2013 a food product is.<ref name=\"Paxton\"/>\n\nWal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food travelled {{convert|1,500|miles|km}} before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.<ref>Jane Black, \"What\u2019s in a Number: How the Press Got the Idea That Food Travels 1,500 Miles from Farm to Plate,\" Slate, September 17, 2008, www.slate.com/ id/ 2200202.</ref>\n\nMore recently, iOS and Android apps are appearing which allow consumers to get various information (nutritional information, ...) and track the origin of products they buy and sometimes also get additional information such as the distance the product has travelled from its production location to the consumer (i.e. OpenLabel, Glow, [[Open Food Facts]], ...).<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mobile-barcode-scanning-apps-empower-consumers-to-shop-with-confidence-20150319-1m2mjz.html Mobile barcode scanning apps empower consumers to shop with confidence]</ref> These apps may rely on [[barcode]] scanning.<ref>[https://www.foodbev.com/news/interview-origintrail-the-app-that-tells-you-where-your-food-is-from/ Interview: OriginTrail, an app that tells you where your food is from]</ref> Also, smartphones can simply scan the [[QR code]], after which a link in the browser opens up showing the production location of the product (i.e. Farm to Fork project, ...).<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/consumers-track-products-smartphone How consumers can track products at the touch of a smartphone button]</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n=== Fair trade ===\n\nAccording to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food [[supply chain]] that also contribute to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions which are not taken into account by simple \"food miles\" measurements.<ref name=\"ChiMacGregorKing\">Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009).

Unless the product has a [[Fairtrade certification]] label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers.<ref>C. Dolan, J. Humphrey, and C.

A recent [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) case study indicated that [[tomato]]es grown in [[Spain]] and transported to the [[United Kingdom]] may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] than heated [[greenhouse]]s in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=0&ProjectID=15001|title=Defra, UK - Science Search|first=Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)|last=Department for Environment|date=|website=defra.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nAccording to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of [[Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)]] in accordance with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14040]], entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by [[economies of scale]]. Research from the [[Justus Liebig University Giessen]] show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of [[energy use]] per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production.<ref>[http://www.uni-giessen.de/fbr09/pt/PT_Ecology_of_Scale.htm]</ref><ref>Schlich E, Fleissner U: The Ecology of Scale.

For example New Zealand [[agriculture]] tends to apply fewer [[fertilizer]]s (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant [[CO2 emissions|{{CO2}} emissions]]) and animals are able to [[grazing|graze]] year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in [[compound feed|feed]] such as [[concentrate]]s.

Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. [[Deforestation]] eliminates [[carbon sinks]], accelerating the process of [[climate change]]. Cultivation, including the use of [[synthetic fertiliser]]s, releases greenhouse gases such as [[nitrous oxide]]. [[Nitrogen fertiliser]] is especially demanding of [[fossil fuels]], as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil.<ref name=\"ChiMacGregorKing\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, it's increasingly recognised that [[meat]] and [[Dairy product|dairy]] are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK's consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom|greenhouse gas emissions]]  related to consumption.<ref name=\"ChiMacGregorKing\"/>\n\nAccording to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]], even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet.<ref>[http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0602-ucsc_liaw_food_miles.html Food miles are less important to environment than food choices, study concludes], Jane Liaw, special to [[Mongabay]], June 2, 2008</ref> They also concluded that \"Shifting less than one day per week\u2019s worth of calories from [[red meat]] and [[dairy products]] to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.\" In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.\n\n=== \"Local\" food miles ===\n\nA commonly ignored element is the [[last mile]]. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5&nbsp;kg of meat over {{convert|60000|mi|km}} by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in [[bulk transport]], or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or {{convert|40|mi|km}} to buy that meat.  Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store  consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices.<ref>Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2009. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. Food Policy, 34 (2), pp. 150-155.</ref>  Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated.  For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the [[last mile]] by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport.  Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.<ref>Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2011. Food miles: time for a re-think? British Food Journal, 113 (7), pp. 919-934.</ref>\n\n=== Lifecycle analysis, rather than food miles ===\n\n[[life cycle assessment|Lifecycle analysis]], a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in [[resource depletion]], [[air|air pollution]] and [[water pollution]] and waste generation/[[municipal solid waste]].<ref>Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009).

The term was coined by Tim Lang (now Professor of Food Policy, [[City University, London]]) who says: \"The point was to highlight the hidden ecological, social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way, one which had objective reality but also connotations.\"<ref>Tim Lang (2006). 'locale / global (food miles)\u2019, Slow Food (Bra, Cuneo Italy), 19, May 2006, p.94-97</ref>  The increased distance traveled by food in developed countries was caused by the globilization of food trade, which increased by 4 times since 1961.<ref>Erik Millstone and Tim Lang, The Atlas of Food, Earthscan, London, 1963, p. 60.</ref> Food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food. Road transport produces 60% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Air transport produces 20% of the world's food transport carbon emissions. Rail and sea transport produce 10% each of the world's food transport carbon emissions.\n\nAlthough it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact, it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact. For example, a [[DEFRA]] report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at [[AEA Technology]] Environment, entitled ''The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development'', included findings that \"the direct environmental, social and economic costs of food transport are over \u00a39 billion each year, and are dominated by congestion.\"<ref>Smith, A. et al. (2005) The Validity of Food Miles as an Indicator of Sustainable Development: Final report. DEFRA, London.

Many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling. More emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place.<ref name=\"motu.org.nz\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.motu.org.nz/files/docs/agdpresentations/AgD23_Saunders_-_Carbon_footprinting_and_other_trade_factors.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207005907/http://motu.org.nz/files/docs/agdpresentations/AgD23_Saunders_-_Carbon_footprinting_and_other_trade_factors.pdf |archive-date=February 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also, the positive environmental effects of [[organic farming]] may be compromised by increased [[transport]]ation, unless it is produced by local [[farm]]s.  The [[Carbon Trust]] notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production, all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered, including production, origin, seasonality and home care.<ref>[http://www.carbontrust.com/news/2012/03/food-the-carbon-story \"Food, the carbon story\"], ''[[The Carbon Trust]]'', 15 March 2012. Retrieved on 20 January 2015.</ref>\n\n==Food miles in business==\nA recent study led by Professor Miguel Gomez (Applied Economics and Management), at [[Cornell University]] and supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] found that in many instances, the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets.  It suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prevor|first=Jim|title=Jim Prevor's Perishable Pundit|url=http://www.perishablepundit.com/index.php?date=10/01/10&pundit=1|accessdate=20 July 2011|date=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Calculating food miles==\n\nWith processed foods that are made of many different ingredients, it is very complicated, though not impossible, to calculate the {{CO2}} emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient, by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport (air, road or rail). However, as both Prof. Lang and the original Food Miles report noted, the resulting number \u2013 although interesting, cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable \u2013 or not \u2013 a food product is.<ref name=\"Paxton\"/>\n\nWal-Mart publicized a press releasing that stated food travelled {{convert|1,500|miles|km}} before it reaches customers. The shocking statistics aroused public concern about food miles. According to Jane Black, a food writer who covers food politics, the number was derived from a small database. The 22 terminal markets from which the data was collected handled 30% of the United States produce.<ref>Jane Black, \"What\u2019s in a Number: How the Press Got the Idea That Food Travels 1,500 Miles from Farm to Plate,\" Slate, September 17, 2008, www.slate.com/ id/ 2200202.</ref>\n\nMore recently, iOS and Android apps are appearing which allow consumers to get various information (nutritional information, ...) and track the origin of products they buy and sometimes also get additional information such as the distance the product has travelled from its production location to the consumer (i.e. OpenLabel, Glow, [[Open Food Facts]], ...).<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mobile-barcode-scanning-apps-empower-consumers-to-shop-with-confidence-20150319-1m2mjz.html Mobile barcode scanning apps empower consumers to shop with confidence]</ref> These apps may rely on [[barcode]] scanning.<ref>[https://www.foodbev.com/news/interview-origintrail-the-app-that-tells-you-where-your-food-is-from/ Interview: OriginTrail, an app that tells you where your food is from]</ref> Also, smartphones can simply scan the [[QR code]], after which a link in the browser opens up showing the production location of the product (i.e. Farm to Fork project, ...).<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/consumers-track-products-smartphone How consumers can track products at the touch of a smartphone button]</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n=== Fair trade ===\n\nAccording to Oxfam researchers, there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food [[supply chain]] that also contribute to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions which are not taken into account by simple \"food miles\" measurements.<ref name=\"ChiMacGregorKing\">Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009).

Smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce, moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets.<ref>MacGregor, J.; Vorley, B (2006) Fair Miles?

Unless the product has a [[Fairtrade certification]] label, or a label from another robust and independent scheme, food exports might make a bad situation worse. Only a very small percentage of what importers pay will end up in the hands of plantation workers.<ref>C. Dolan, J. Humphrey, and C.

A recent [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) case study indicated that [[tomato]]es grown in [[Spain]] and transported to the [[United Kingdom]] may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] than heated [[greenhouse]]s in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=0&ProjectID=15001|title=Defra, UK - Science Search|first=Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)|last=Department for Environment|date=|website=defra.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nAccording to German researchers, the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account. Using the methodology of [[Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)]] in accordance with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14040]], entire supply chains providing German consumers with food were investigated, comparing local food with food of European and global provenance. Large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation, leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by [[economies of scale]]. Research from the [[Justus Liebig University Giessen]] show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of [[energy use]] per kilogram, even though food miles are lower. Case studies of lamb, beef, wine, apples, fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production.<ref>[http://www.uni-giessen.de/fbr09/pt/PT_Ecology_of_Scale.htm]</ref><ref>Schlich E, Fleissner U: The Ecology of Scale.

For example New Zealand [[agriculture]] tends to apply fewer [[fertilizer]]s (which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant [[CO2 emissions|{{CO2}} emissions]]) and animals are able to [[grazing|graze]] year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in [[compound feed|feed]] such as [[concentrate]]s. In the case of [[Dairy product|dairy]] and [[Lamb and mutton|sheep meat]] production NZ is by far more [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]], even including the transport cost, than the UK, twice as efficient in the case of dairy, and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat.<ref name=\"motu.org.nz\"/> In the case of [[apple]]s, NZ is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the UK.\"\n\nOther researchers have contested the claims from New Zealand. Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones has said that the arguments \u201cin favour of New Zealand apples shipped to the UK is probably true only or about two months a year, during July and August, when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores.\u201d<ref>'Food miles' minor element of carbon footprint, http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=40471.

Clearing land of trees, and cultivation, are the main drivers of farming emissions. [[Deforestation]] eliminates [[carbon sinks]], accelerating the process of [[climate change]]. Cultivation, including the use of [[synthetic fertiliser]]s, releases greenhouse gases such as [[nitrous oxide]]. [[Nitrogen fertiliser]] is especially demanding of [[fossil fuels]], as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil.<ref name=\"ChiMacGregorKing\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, it's increasingly recognised that [[meat]] and [[Dairy product|dairy]] are the largest sources of food-related emissions. The UK's consumption of meat and dairy products (including imports) accounts for about 8% of national [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom|greenhouse gas emissions]]  related to consumption.<ref name=\"ChiMacGregorKing\"/>\n\nAccording to a study by engineers Christopher Weber and H. Scott Matthews of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry, only 4% comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers. The study also concluded that adopting a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]], even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances, does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, than does eating a locally grown diet.<ref>[http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0602-ucsc_liaw_food_miles.html Food miles are less important to environment than food choices, study concludes], Jane Liaw, special to [[Mongabay]], June 2, 2008</ref> They also concluded that \"Shifting less than one day per week\u2019s worth of calories from [[red meat]] and [[dairy products]] to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.\" In other words, the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles.\n\n=== \"Local\" food miles ===\n\nA commonly ignored element is the [[last mile]]. For example, a gallon of gasoline could transport 5&nbsp;kg of meat over {{convert|60000|mi|km}} by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg) in [[bulk transport]], or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or {{convert|40|mi|km}} to buy that meat.  Thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store  consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store. This can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices.<ref>Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2009. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. Food Policy, 34 (2), pp. 150-155.</ref>  Relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated.  For example, consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the [[last mile]] by walking, bicycling, or taking public transport.  Another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance.<ref>Coley, D. A., Howard, M. and Winter, M., 2011. Food miles: time for a re-think? British Food Journal, 113 (7), pp. 919-934.</ref>\n\n=== Lifecycle analysis, rather than food miles ===\n\n[[life cycle assessment|Lifecycle analysis]], a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste, is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat. The technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production, processing, packaging and transport of food. It also factors in [[resource depletion]], [[air|air pollution]] and [[water pollution]] and waste generation/[[municipal solid waste]].<ref>Chi, Kelly Rae, James MacGregor and Richard King (2009).
