The models facial features are simply constructed with only a few surface planes juxtaposed in geometric terms at various angles.

The shoulders and neck form a robust base upon which the head rests. The models hair, while treated almost realistically, are stylized and cut radically at an angle with the forehead. Only one eye is visible.\n\nThe treatment of Csaky's ''T\u00eate d'homme'', as other works by the artist executed between 1910 and 1914, suggest, as Albert Edward Elsen notes, that Csaky had looked not only at Picasso's earlier painting and sculpture, but also at African tribal masks whose exaggerated features and simplified design accommodated the need to be seen at a distance and to evoke strong feeling.<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" /><ref>Albert Edward Elsen, ''Origins of modern sculpture: pioneers and premises'', G.

The complex angular syntax visible in ''Head'' was born out of a growing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of rhythm, balance, harmony and out of the powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, African art, early Cycladic art, Gothic art, of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], all of whom Csaky greatly admired.<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\" />\n\n==Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, 1914==\nAt the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, held in Paris 1 to 30 March 1914, composed of many [[Orphism (art)|Orphist]] works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor of the at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elys\u00e9es: [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]] were largely represented.<ref name=\"Kubisme\">[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]</ref>\n\nCsaky exhibited ''T\u00eate d'homme'' (plaster, n. 814 or 815 of the catalog), along with another bust and ''[[Danseuse (Csaky)|Danseuse]]'' (1912), executed in a highly Cubist facture.<ref name=\"Marcilhac\" /> Several years later, [[Marcel Duchamp]], speaking about his own experience during the revolutionary years in the history of art of the 20th century, presented Joseph Csaky as \"belonging to a group of sculptors who, before 1914,  imparted a new direction in their work.
