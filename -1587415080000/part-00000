At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of \"[[The Victors]]\" at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#Goal post toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques. Thanks to Fischer's prolonged efforts to secure university funding for the band, Wilfred Wilson was hired by the university in 1915 as the ensemble's new conductor.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n\nThe Nu Chapter of the band fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], was established to promote and serve the University bands in 1925. Around this time, the university purchased Morris Hall and allocated it as the band's permanent \"home.\" By 1926, membership in the band had grown to nearly 100 musicians prior to Fischer's departure. Nicholas Falcone was appointed as his successor in 1927.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" /> That same year, construction of [[Michigan Stadium]] was completed and dedicated.<ref name=\"Big House History\">{{cite web| title=The Michigan Stadium Story | url=https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/openday.htm | date=2006-04-10 | publisher=The University of Michigan | accessdate=2019-05-06}}</ref> The band became an adjunct part of the University in 1929.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n [[File:Michigan Marching Band performs Yellow and Blue at halftime of the Chicago game, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|'''Michigan Marching Band performs Yellow and Blue at halftime of the Chicago game, 1920''']]\n\n=== 1930 - 1949 ===\nDuring the Michigan-Ohio State football game in 1932, the MMB performed the first \"[[Ohio State University Marching Band#Script Ohio|script Ohio]].\" That field formation was subsequently embellished by the [[Ohio State University Marching Band]], which continues to perform it today.<ref>{{cite web |title=Script Ohio Controversy |work=OSU v Michigan |publisher=Ohio State University Archives |date=2002-10-12 |url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/OSUvsMichigan/scriptohio.htm |accessdate=2019-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026090107/http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/OSUvsMichigan/scriptohio.htm |archivedate=2006-10-26}}</ref> The band performed at the [[Century of Progress]] exhibition in Chicago in October 1933.<ref>{{cite web | title=Varsity Band Plans Concert at Exhibition | publisher=The Michigan Daily | date=1933-10-24 |url=https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755941/187 |accessdate=2019-05-08}}</ref> Falcone was on medical leave in 1934, and Bernard Hirsch served as acting conductor. Falcone resigned in 1935 after a long struggle with hearing loss, and [[William D. Revelli]], director of the award-winning Hobart, Indiana, high school band, was hired as his successor. In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band. To raise funds for a new band facility, Revelli oversaw an all-campus talent show known as \"Varsity Night.\" This annual event would later evolve into the Band-O-Rama concert series.<ref>{{Citation | title=School of Music, Theatre & Dance (University of Michigan) Publications | publisher=UM Libraries | date=1996 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0nlAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PT615&ots=K6gMspPEf2&dq=-site%3Amichiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&pg=PT615#v=onepage&q=-site:michiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&f=false | access-date=2019-05-06 }}</ref>\n[[File:University of Michigan Band halftime show 1949.jpg|thumb|389x389px|1949 Michigan Band performing a halftime show in Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor MI.]]\n\nRevelli formally aligned the band with the School of Music in 1940.

By the end of the war, the band's home had been relocated to [[Harris Hall]] in 1946 and membership in the band stood at 131 men in 1947. During that season, the band first appeared on television in the game against [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] on September 27.

The Lambda Chapter of the band sorority, [[Tau Beta Sigma]] was established in 1948. In 1949, Revelli and his assistant director, Jack K. Lee, organized and hosted the first University of Michigan Band Day.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n===Drum Major===\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#Back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n===Section Leaders===\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n===Rank Leaders===\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n===Performance Block===\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n===Reserves===\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n==Band Week==\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n==Routines==\n\n===Saturday morning rehearsal===\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n===Step Show===\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n===March to the stadium===\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n===Pregame Show===\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n====Entries====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n====\"M Fanfare\"====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n=====Back bend=====\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n====\"The Victors\"====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of 'The Victors!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"The Victors\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n=====Goal post toss=====\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n=====Lock step / high step=====\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n=====Glide step=====\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional [[Glide step|glide step]] is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n====Visitor's fight song====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n====\"Varsity\"====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n====\"Blues Brothers\"====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n====\"Let's Go Blue\" and team entrance====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"Let's Go Blue\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n===Postgame show===\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|The Fighting Irish]]\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n====\"Temptation\" and \"Hawaiian War Chant\"====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Forever Valiant |year=2017}}</ref>\n*''This is Michigan'' (2012)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=This is Michigan |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2012}}</ref>\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=2008 Season Highlights |title-link= |others= |year=2009 |publisher=Regents Of The University Of Michigan |id=UMMBCDSPS }}</ref>\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web |title=Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics |url=https://www.amazon.com/Gameday-Faves-Michigan-Wolverines-Classics/dp/B002VBVHYE/ |website=Amazon.com |publisher=2Thumbz Entertainment |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Maize Album'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Maize Album |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2009}}</ref>\n*''The Blue Album'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Blue Album |others=Jamie L.

At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of ''[[The Victors]]'' at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#Goal post toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques. Thanks to Fischer's prolonged efforts to secure university funding for the band, Wilfred Wilson was hired by the university in 1915 as the ensemble's new conductor.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n\nThe Nu Chapter of the band fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], was established to promote and serve the University bands in 1925. Around this time, the university purchased Morris Hall and allocated it as the band's permanent \"home.\" By 1926, membership in the band had grown to nearly 100 musicians prior to Fischer's departure.

Falcone resigned in 1935 after a long struggle with hearing loss, and [[William D. Revelli]], director of the award-winning Hobart, Indiana, high school band, was hired as his successor. In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band. To raise funds for a new band facility, Revelli oversaw an all-campus talent show known as \"Varsity Night.\" This annual event would later evolve into the Band-O-Rama concert series.<ref>{{Citation | title=School of Music, Theatre & Dance (University of Michigan) Publications | publisher=UM Libraries | date=1996 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0nlAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PT615&ots=K6gMspPEf2&dq=-site%3Amichiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&pg=PT615#v=onepage&q=-site:michiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&f=false | access-date=2019-05-06 }}</ref>\n[[File:University of Michigan Band halftime show 1949.jpg|thumb|389x389px|1949 Michigan Band performing a halftime show in Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor MI.]]\n\nRevelli formally aligned the band with the School of Music in 1940.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n===Drum Major===\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#Back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n===Section Leaders===\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n===Rank Leaders===\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n===Performance Block===\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n===Reserves===\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n==Band Week==\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n==Routines==\n\n===Saturday morning rehearsal===\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n===Step Show===\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n===March to the stadium===\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n===Pregame Show===\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n====Entries====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n====\"M Fanfare\"====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n=====Back bend=====\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n====\"The Victors\"====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of 'The Victors!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"The Victors\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n=====Goal post toss=====\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n=====Lock step / high step=====\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n=====Glide step=====\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional [[Glide step|glide step]] is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n====Visitor's fight song====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n====\"Varsity\"====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n====\"Blues Brothers\"====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n====\"Let's Go Blue\" and team entrance====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"Let's Go Blue\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n===Postgame show===\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|The Fighting Irish]]\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n====\"Temptation\" and \"Hawaiian War Chant\"====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Forever Valiant |year=2017}}</ref>\n*''This is Michigan'' (2012)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=This is Michigan |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2012}}</ref>\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=2008 Season Highlights |title-link= |others= |year=2009 |publisher=Regents Of The University Of Michigan |id=UMMBCDSPS }}</ref>\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web |title=Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics |url=https://www.amazon.com/Gameday-Faves-Michigan-Wolverines-Classics/dp/B002VBVHYE/ |website=Amazon.com |publisher=2Thumbz Entertainment |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Maize Album'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Maize Album |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2009}}</ref>\n*''The Blue Album'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Blue Album |others=Jamie L.

{"title_page": "National Scholastic Surfing Association", "text_new": "The '''National Scholastic Surfing Association''' ('''NSSA''') is a [[surfing]] association in the United States. It is a member organization of Surfing America, the National Governing Body of Surfing in the United States. Founded in 1978 by Tom Gibbons, John Rothrock, Chuck Allen, Laird Hayes, Holly Allen and Rob Hill, the association was formed with the purpose of uniting amateur surfers from around the country under one competitive association tied to the education system.  Since much of the membership consists of students, one of the prerequisites in joining the association is the maintenance of good grades, service to community and an interest in the sport of surfing.\n\nOn February 4, 1978, a group of surf coaches met in Huntington Beach to form a new surfing association for amateur high school and college surfers.\n\nThose present at the meeting voted to name the new entity, the NATIONAL SCHOLASTIC SURFING ASSOCIATION (NSSA).  Several very important resolutions were quickly adopted.  Since membership would consist of students, it was important that any fees established for competitors be minimal.  A fee of $1 per year was voted for student membership and $5 a year for supporting members.  If additional monies were needed, the group decided it would be raised by other means.\n\nThe group agreed to do the utmost to improve the image of the surfer and to stress water safety and fair play in the water.  One way to accomplish this is through supervised surf contests.  Surfers competing on teams are required to maintain the same academic standards as athletes participating in football and other sports.\n\nAnother important resolution adopted was one to allow any NSSA surfer to retain his/her right to also surf in any other amateur surfing associations.\n\nThe next step was to elect officers that had the clout to put things together.  Dr. Laird Hayes, Assistant Dean of Students at Orange Coast College was elected Vice President.  Laird was asked to formulate a scholarship program for the NSSA.  Since financial management would be critical, Chuck Allen surf coach of the El Toro Surf Team and Senior VP of a large savings & loan, was elected Treasurer.  His wife, Holly, was elected Secretary.  Rob Hill, wood shop teacher at Huntington Beach High School and coach of their surf team, was elected Competition Director.  John Rothrock, Director of the Student Career Center at Edison High School and coach of their surf team, was elected Publicity Director.  John also had a background in printing, thus adding that dimension to his post.  Jim Clark, an executive with a large, international insurance company located in San Francisco, was elected Membership Chairman.  Tom Gibbons, surf coach at Marina High School and at California State University Long Beach was elected President.\n\nThe last item for discussion was perhaps the most important.  Since everyone present was interested in founding a surfing association that would last and be meaningful, a Resolution was adopted authorizing President Tom Gibbons to approach the most respected and influential people in the surfing community and ask for their support.\n\nShortly thereafter, the following people had been contacted and had agreed to serve on the NSSA Board of Advisers:\nVince Moorhouse, Director of Harbors and Beaches and President of Would Life Saving.  Dr. Jake Abbott, Superintendent of Huntington Beach Union High School District, the first District in the United States to offer surfing as a letter sport.  Rus Calisch, Advertising Director of Skateboarder Magazine and Executive Director of the United States Surfing Association.  Bill Dinnie, owner of Sunline Surfboards in Huntington Beach and one of the most sought after surf judges in Southern California.  Jim Jenks, President of Ocean Pacific and long-time surfer.  Nancy Katin, truly the first lady of surfing and sponsor of the annual Katin Pro-Am Contest.  Bob Mignogna, Business Director of SURFING MAGAZINE and ultra-hot surfer.  Hugh Murphy, probation officer with the City of Los Angeles and Executive Director of the Western Surfing Association.  Dennis Mangers, California Assemblyman from Huntington Beach and long-time surfer.  Steve Pezman, Publisher of SURFER MAGAZINE and long-time surfer.  Bud Robinson, President of Richton Sportswear and long-time supporter of surfing.  Hoppy Swarts, educator and founder of the United States Surfing Association.  Dr. Jerry Thornsley, Superintendent of Capistrano Unified School District and long-time surfer.  All accepted to serve.\n\nA few days later, the Officers of the NSSA met and set-up a series of 12 surf contests that would last through August, the end of the Open Season surf period.  A mailing outlining the actions taken was sent to over 1,000 people across the USA.  Within days, the response started flowing in.  Membership soared to over 650 surfers, representing 27 surf teams from California to Rhode Island.  Through the efforts of the NSSA Board of Advisors, donations were received from OP, Hang Ten, Kanvas by Katin, Surfer and Surfing Magazines, Quicksilver and others.\n\nThe response from the surfers to the contests proved excellent.  It indicated one thing; surfers want to surf in well-run and fairly judged contests.\n\nThe NSSA hosted the first National Championships in Huntington Beach, California in December of 1978.  The contest winner was Mark McDandel from the University of South Carolina.  As a result of that contest, a National Team including 12 men, 3 women and 3 knee-riders was selected based upon surfing ability, scholarship, and service to community. The Team was composed of student surfers whom younger surfers could look up to as positive role models. The team was provided full competition gear, all specially, uniformly and specifically designed.  Our primary thrust is to encourage high school students to further their education by attending college or trade schools.  One way we do this is to encourage surfing programs at the high schools and colleges.  Scholarships were awarded at the Nationals in December with the first $500.00 scholarship named the \"Nancy Katin\" Scholarship being awarded to Ruben Chappins from Cal State University Long Beach.\n\nFrom short-range planning, the NSSA formulated its long-range goals.  Correspondence from the U.S. Olympic Committee outlining their requirements was studied and we have forwarded a portion of the requirements to them.  The AAU has indicated support and encouragement forwarded an application for Allied Membership.  During our National Championships in December, we will be awarding scholarships.  The National Team's first international competition was against the National Team of Peru at Punta Roca, south of Lima.  The NSSA National Team won this first competition, coached by Tom Gibbons and John Rothrock.\n\nThe NSSA cannot do these things without the support of the entire surfing community.  Early funding received went towards programs that benefit the surfer and work done by the NSSA Officers and Board of Advisors was gratis.\n\nThe NSSA is divided into nine conferences nationwide. Surfers from the various conferences compete for slots in the Regional Championships, with those winners proceeding to the NSSA National Championships.  Top surfers then earn slots into the Surfing America USA Championships which has competitors from all major organizations competing for USA Championship titles and a spot on the USA Surf Team.  Although it has a special emphasis on student surfers, the NSSA membership is open to anyone who wants to surf competitively as an amateur. The NSSA no longer fields its own national team.\n\nMany well known surfers have competed in the NSSA before turning professional.  These include [[Kelly Slater]], [[Andy Irons]], [[Carissa Moore]], Kalani Robb, [[Cheyne Magnusson]], [[Bethany Hamilton]] and [[Bobby Martinez]]. Carissa Moore currently holds the most NSSA Nationals titles with 11 overall while [[Kolohe Andino]] holds the most titles won by a male competitor (9).  \n\n==National Championship Titles==\n''' National Scholastic Surfing Association (1978 - 2019)'''\n\n\n\n\n===College Team Champions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is a member organization of Surfing America, the National Governing Body of Surfing in the United States. Founded in 1978 by Tom Gibbons, John Rothrock, Chuck Allen, Laird Hayes, Holly Allen and Rob Hill, the association was formed with the purpose of uniting amateur surfers from around the country under one competitive association tied to the education system.  Since much of the membership consists of students, one of the prerequisites in joining the association is the maintenance of good grades, service to community and an interest in the sport of surfing.\n\nOn February 4, 1978, a group of surf coaches met in Huntington Beach to form a new surfing association for amateur high school and college surfers.\n\nThose present at the meeting voted to name the new entity, the NATIONAL SCHOLASTIC SURFING ASSOCIATION (NSSA).  Several very important resolutions were quickly adopted.  Since membership would consist of students, it was important that any fees established for competitors be minimal.  A fee of $1 per year was voted for student membership and $5 a year for supporting members.  If additional monies were needed, the group decided it would be raised by other means.\n\nThe group agreed to do the utmost to improve the image of the surfer and to stress water safety and fair play in the water.  One way to accomplish this is through supervised surf contests.  Surfers competing on teams are required to maintain the same academic standards as athletes participating in football and other sports.\n\nAnother important resolution adopted was one to allow any NSSA surfer to retain his/her right to also surf in any other amateur surfing associations.\n\nThe next step was to elect officers that had the clout to put things together.  Dr. Laird Hayes, Assistant Dean of Students at Orange Coast College was elected Vice President.  Laird was asked to formulate a scholarship program for the NSSA.  Since financial management would be critical, Chuck Allen surf coach of the El Toro Surf Team and Senior VP of a large savings & loan, was elected Treasurer.  His wife, Holly, was elected Secretary.  Rob Hill, wood shop teacher at Huntington Beach High School and coach of their surf team, was elected Competition Director.  John Rothrock, Director of the Student Career Center at Edison High School and coach of their surf team, was elected Publicity Director.  John also had a background in printing, thus adding that dimension to his post.  Jim Clark, an executive with a large, international insurance company located in San Francisco, was elected Membership Chairman.  Tom Gibbons, surf coach at Marina High School and at California State University Long Beach was elected President.\n\nThe last item for discussion was perhaps the most important.  Since everyone present was interested in founding a surfing association that would last and be meaningful, a Resolution was adopted authorizing President Tom Gibbons to approach the most respected and influential people in the surfing community and ask for their support.\n\nShortly thereafter, the following people had been contacted and had agreed to serve on the NSSA Board of Advisers:\nVince Moorhouse, Director of Harbors and Beaches and President of Would Life Saving.  Dr. Jake Abbott, Superintendent of Huntington Beach Union High School District, the first District in the United States to offer surfing as a letter sport.  Rus Calisch, Advertising Director of Skateboarder Magazine and Executive Director of the United States Surfing Association.  Bill Dinnie, owner of Sunline Surfboards in Huntington Beach and one of the most sought after surf judges in Southern California.  Jim Jenks, President of Ocean Pacific and long-time surfer.  Nancy Katin, truly the first lady of surfing and sponsor of the annual Katin Pro-Am Contest.  Bob Mignogna, Business Director of SURFING MAGAZINE and ultra-hot surfer.  Hugh Murphy, probation officer with the City of Los Angeles and Executive Director of the Western Surfing Association.  Dennis Mangers, California Assemblyman from Huntington Beach and long-time surfer.  Steve Pezman, Publisher of SURFER MAGAZINE and long-time surfer.  Bud Robinson, President of Richton Sportswear and long-time supporter of surfing.  Hoppy Swarts, educator and founder of the United States Surfing Association.  Dr. Jerry Thornsley, Superintendent of Capistrano Unified School District and long-time surfer.

The standalone single \"[[Chip Away the Stone]]\", also released in 1978, charted at number 77.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\n===Departures of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, ''Night in the Ruts'', and ''Rock in a Hard Place'' (1979\u20131984)===\nIn 1979, the band started work on their next album, ''[[Night in the Ruts]]'', but Aerosmith decided to go on tour during a break in the recording schedule. As the decade was about to conclude, the band's drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to [[Cleveland Stadium]] on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the [[World Series of Rock]] festival. Pandemonium erupted backstage when Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument, Perry left Aerosmith (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). Upon his departure, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure, Perry formed his own side project known as [[The Joe Perry Project]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone\" />\n\nSince there was still work to be done on ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts, and [[Richard Supa|Richie Supa]], the band's longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire [[Jimmy Crespo]] to take over as the next full-time guitarist. ''Night in the Ruts'' was released in November 1979, but only managed to sell enough records to be certified gold at the time, although it would eventually sell enough copies to be certified platinum by 1994. The only single the album spawned, a cover of \"[[Remember (Walking in the Sand)]]\" by [[the Shangri-Las]], peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\nThe tour for ''Night in the Ruts'' commenced shortly thereafter, but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached rock bottom in 1980, when he collapsed on stage during a show in [[Portland, Maine]], and did not get up for the remainder of the set.<ref>Davis, p. 371</ref> Also in 1980, Aerosmith released their first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]''. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later, and went on to become the band's best selling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.<ref>Davis, pp. 373\u2013374</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'', and saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. However, after the first song for the album, \"[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]\", was recorded, Brad Whitford left the band, and decided to form a duo with [[Derek St. Holmes]], with whom he recorded a [[Whitford/St. Holmes|self-titled album]], which failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.<ref>Davis, p. 378</ref>\n\nWith [[Rick Dufay]] taking Whitford's place, ''Rock in a Hard Place'' was released on August 27, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> Only one single charted, the aforementioned \"Lightning Strikes\", which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> As with the tour for ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues, and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a homecoming arena show in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.<ref>Davis, p. 400</ref>\n\nOn February 14, 1984, Perry (by then divorced from his first wife Elissa) and Whitford saw Aerosmith perform at Boston's [[Orpheum Theatre (Boston)|Orpheum Theater]]. Shortly thereafter, discussions began to reintegrate the two into the band and several months later, the original members of Aerosmith officially reunited.<ref>Davis, p. 417</ref> Steven Tyler recalls:{{cquote|You should have felt the buzz the moment all five of us got together in the same room for the first time again.

While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> With their drug problems still not behind them, the group was signed to [[Geffen Records]], and began working on a comeback.<ref name=\"Biography.com\" /> Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band's old label [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] continued to reap the benefits of Aerosmith's comeback, releasing the live companion albums ''[[Classics Live I and II]]'' and the collection ''[[Gems (Aerosmith album)|Gems]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allmusic&nbsp;\u2013 ''Gems''&nbsp;\u2013 Review|author=Greg Prato|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r181|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, the band released the album ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'', their first studio album since reuniting.

In 1986, Tyler completed a successful [[drug rehabilitation]] program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager [[Tim Collins (manager)|Tim Collins]], who believed that the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated in time. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs over the course of the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 that he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab.<ref>Davis, pp. 1\u201315</ref> Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of ''Done With Mirrors'', and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.<ref>Davis, p. 454</ref>\n\n===''Permanent Vacation'' and ''Pump'' (1987\u20131991)===\n''[[Permanent Vacation (album)|Permanent Vacation]]'' was released in August 1987, becoming a major hit and the band's bestselling album in over a decade (selling 5 million copies in the U.S.),<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> with all three of its singles (\"[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]\", \"[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]]\", and \"[[Rag Doll (Aerosmith song)|Rag Doll]]\") reaching the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> Steven Tyler reveals in his autobiography that the album was \"...the first one we ever did sober.\"<ref>Steven Tyler with David Dalton (2011) The Autobiography: Does the noise in my head bother you?.

While the group was initially hesitant to using outside songwriters, including Tyler being furious for Knight getting songwriting credits for changing one word (\"Rag Time\" became \"Rag Doll\"), the method paid off, as ''Permanent Vacation'' became the band's most successful album in a decade. The group went on [[Permanent Vacation Tour|a subsequent tour]] with labelmates [[Guns N' Roses]] (who have cited Aerosmith as a major influence), which was intense at times because of Aerosmith's new struggle to stay clean amidst Guns N' Roses' well-publicized, rampant drug use.<ref>Davis, pp. 460\u2013461</ref>\n{{Listen|filename=Aerosmith - Janie's Got a Gun.ogg|title=\"Janie's Got a Gun\"\n|description=Sample of \"[[Janie's Got a Gun]]\" by Aerosmith, from ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'' (1989)\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n|pos=left}}\n\nAerosmith's next album was even more successful.

Rock critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] claimed that ''Pump'' \"revels in [pop concessions] without ever losing sight of Aerosmith's dirty hard rock core\", going on to say that, \"such ambition and successful musical eclectism make ''Pump'' rank with ''Toys in the Attic'' and ''Rocks''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Pump \u2013 Aerosmith|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pump-r182|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> The recording process for ''Pump'' was documented in the video ''[[The Making of Pump]]'', which has since been re-released as a DVD.

As the decade was about to conclude, the band's drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to [[Cleveland Stadium]] on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the [[World Series of Rock]] festival. Pandemonium erupted backstage when Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument, Perry left Aerosmith (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). Upon his departure, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure, Perry formed his own side project known as [[The Joe Perry Project]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /><ref name=\"Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone\" />\n\nSince there was still work to be done on ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts, and [[Richard Supa|Richie Supa]], the band's longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire [[Jimmy Crespo]] to take over as the next full-time guitarist. ''Night in the Ruts'' was released in November 1979, but only managed to sell enough records to be certified gold at the time, although it would eventually sell enough copies to be certified platinum by 1994. The only single the album spawned, a cover of \"[[Remember (Walking in the Sand)]]\" by [[the Shangri-Las]], peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/>\n\nThe tour for ''Night in the Ruts'' commenced shortly thereafter, but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached rock bottom in 1980, when he collapsed on stage during a show in [[Portland, Maine]], and did not get up for the remainder of the set.<ref>Davis, p. 371</ref> Also in 1980, Aerosmith released their first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]''. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later, and went on to become the band's best selling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.<ref>Davis, pp. 373\u2013374</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'', and saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. However, after the first song for the album, \"[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]\", was recorded, Brad Whitford left the band, and decided to form a duo with [[Derek St. Holmes]], with whom he recorded a [[Whitford/St. Holmes|self-titled album]], which failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.<ref>Davis, p. 378</ref>\n\nWith [[Rick Dufay]] taking Whitford's place, ''Rock in a Hard Place'' was released on August 27, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.<ref name=\"RIAA&nbsp;\u2014 Searchable Database\" /> Only one single charted, the aforementioned \"Lightning Strikes\", which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart.<ref name=\"Aerosmith Chart Positions\"/> As with the tour for ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues, and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do.

The season ran throughout 2015, though most tropical cyclones typically [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] between May and November. The season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Mekkhala (2015)|Mekkhala]], developed on January 15, while the season's last named storm, [[Typhoon Melor (2015)|Melor]], dissipated on December 17. The season saw at least one named tropical system forming in each of every month, the first time since [[1965 Pacific typhoon season|1965]]. Similar to the [[2014 Pacific typhoon season|previous season]], this season saw a high number of super typhoons. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) during 2015 was extremely high, the second highest since the [[1970 Pacific typhoon season|1970]], and the 2015 ACE has been attributed in part to anthropogenic warming.<ref>{{cite web |title=INFLUENCES OF NATURAL VARIABILITY AND ANTHROPOGENIC FORCING ON THE EXTREME 2015 ACCUMULATED CYCLONE ENERGY IN THE WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC |publisher=Zhang, W.

Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]&nbsp;<small>(JMA)</small> will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained wind speeds]] of at least 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]]&nbsp;<small>(PAGASA)</small> assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]&nbsp;<small>(JTWC)</small> are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n!

Pacific typhoon season''' was a slightly above average season that produced 27 tropical storms, 18 typhoons, and nine super typhoons. The season ran throughout 2015, though most tropical cyclones typically [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] between May and November. The season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Mekkhala (2015)|Mekkhala]], developed on January 15, while the season's last named storm, [[Typhoon Melor (2015)|Melor]], dissipated on December 17. The season saw at least one named tropical system forming in each of every month, the first time since [[1965 Pacific typhoon season|1965]]. Similar to the [[2014 Pacific typhoon season|previous season]], this season saw a high number of super typhoons. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) during 2015 was extremely high, the second highest since the [[1970 Pacific typhoon season|1970]], and the 2015 ACE has been attributed in part to anthropogenic warming.<ref>{{cite web |title=INFLUENCES OF NATURAL VARIABILITY AND ANTHROPOGENIC FORCING ON THE EXTREME 2015 ACCUMULATED CYCLONE ENERGY IN THE WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC |publisher=Zhang, W. Et Al. |url=http://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2015/26_wnp_ace.pdf |date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between [[100th meridian east|100\u00b0E]] and [[180th meridian]]. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]&nbsp;<small>(JMA)</small> will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained wind speeds]] of at least 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]]&nbsp;<small>(PAGASA)</small> assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135\u00b0E and 115\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N\u201325\u00b0N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]&nbsp;<small>(JTWC)</small> are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n!

These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk&nbsp;<small>(TSR)</small> Consortium of the [[University College London]], [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] <small>(PAGASA)</small> and the Taiwan's [[Central Weather Bureau]]. Some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the El Ni\u00f1o Conditions that were observed during the year. The first forecast of the year was released by PAGASA during January 2015, within its seasonal climate outlook for the period January&nbsp;\u2013 June.<ref name=\"PAG 1\" /> The outlook noted that one to two tropical cyclones were expected between January and March while one to three were expected to develop or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between April and June.<ref name=\"PAG 1\" />\n\nDuring March the [[Hong Kong Observatory]] predicted that the typhoon season in Hong Kong, would be near normal with four to seven tropical cyclones passing within {{convert|500|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} of the territory compared to an average of six.<ref>{{cite web |title=Speech by Mr Shun Chi-ming, Director of the Hong Kong Observatory March 17, 2014 |date=March

forecasted that the risk of a typhoon severely affecting Micronesia was high, with most islands predicted to have a \"1 in 3 chance\" of serious effects from some combination of high winds, large waves and extreme rainfall from a typhoon.<ref name=\"PEAC\" /> They also predicted that there was a near 100% chance of severe effects from a typhoon somewhere within Micronesia.<ref name=\"PEAC\" /> On May 6, Tropical Storm Risk issued their first forecast for the season and predicted that the season, would be the most active since [[2004 Pacific typhoon season|2004]] with activity forecast to be
