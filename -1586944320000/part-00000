It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]!

Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007.

''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref name=wormssales>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | url=http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | title=Sales of ''Worms'' skyrockets | author=Staff | date=March 1996 | archivedate=October 18, 1996 | work=[[Computer Game Review]] | url-status=dead }}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of... Worms|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=March 2006|pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out.

These territories are located in many parts of the world. There are many administrative divisions, which may have political ([[local government]]), electoral (districts), or administrative (decentralized services of the state) objectives. All the inhabited territories are represented in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], [[French Senate|Senate]] and [[French Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] and their citizens have [[French nationality law|French citizenship]].\n\n== Types of division ==\n=== Regions, the most integrated territories===\n{{France Regions Labelled Map}}\n\nThe French republic is divided into 18 regions: 12 in mainland France and 6 elsewhere (1 in [[Europe]] ([[Corsica]]), 2 in the [[Caribbean]] ([[Lesser Antilles|The lesser Antilles]]) ([[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]]), 1 in [[South America]] ([[Guyane]]), and 2 near [[Africa]] ([[Mayotte]] and [[R\u00e9union island]])). They are traditionally divided between the Metropolitan regions, located on the European continent, and the Overseas regions, located outside the European continent. Both have the same status and form the most integrated part of the French Republic.\n\n==== Metropolitan regions ====\n{{As of|2016|1|1}}, [[metropolitan France]] is divided into the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=99&ref_id=t_0203R |title=Circonscriptions administratives au 1er janvier 2015 : comparaisons r\u00e9gionales |trans-title=Administrative constituencies of 1 January 2015: regional comparisons |language=French |publisher=[[Institut national de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques|INSEE]] |accessdate=5 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430033500/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=99&ref_id=t_0203R |archivedate=30 April 2014 }}</ref>\n* 13 [[Regions of France|regions]], including [[Corsica]];<ref>{{cite web|title=La r\u00e9forme territoriale |language=fr |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/la-reforme-territoriale |publisher=[[Government of France]] |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230075909/http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/la-reforme-territoriale |archivedate=30 December 2015 }}</ref> although Corsica is formally a [[territorial collectivity]], it is considered equivalent to a region.

(not a public or legal entity)\n* The arrondissements are subdivided into 1,995 [[Cantons of France|cantons]]. (not a public or legal entity)\n* The cantons are subdivided into 36,529 [[Communes in France|communes]]. (local authority)\n** Three urban communes ([[Paris]], [[Marseille]], and [[Lyon]]) are further divided into [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]]. There are 20 [[arrondissements of Paris]], 16 [[arrondissements of Marseille]], and 9 [[arrondissements of Lyon]].\n** The city of [[Marseille]] is also divided into 8 municipal sectors. Each sector is composed of two arrondissements.\n**There are also 710 [[Associated communes of France|associated communes]] ({{as of|January 2009|lc=yes}}), formerly independent communes which were merged with larger communes but have retained some limited degree of autonomy (e.g. the commune of [[Lomme]] which was absorbed by [[Lille]] in 2000 and transformed into an \"associated commune\" inside the commune of Lille).\n\nFurthermore, {{as of|January 2009|lc=yes}}, there exist 2,585 [[Communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] structures grouping 34,077 communes (93.2% of all the communes of metropolitan France), with 87.4% of the population of metropolitan France living in them.<ref name=DGCl_source>{{cite web| url=http://www.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/statistiques/intercommunalite/bilan_statistique/bilan_statistique_20/view| title=Intercommunalit\u00e9 - Bilan statistique 2009| first=Ministry of the Interior| last=Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des collectivit\u00e9s locales (DGCL)| accessdate=24 March 2009| authorlink=Minister of the Interior (France)| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306153041/http://www.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/statistiques/intercommunalite/bilan_statistique/bilan_statistique_20/view| archivedate=6 March 2009| url-status=dead| language=fr| df=dmy-all}}</ref> These intercommunal structures are:\n*16 [[Urban communities in France|Urban communities]] (''communaut\u00e9s urbaines'', or CU)\n*167 [[Agglomeration communities in France|Agglomeration communities]] (''communaut\u00e9s d'agglom\u00e9ration'', or CA)\n*2,397 [[Commune communities in France|Commune communities]] (''communaut\u00e9s de communes'', or CC)\n*5 Syndicates of New Agglomeration (''syndicats d'agglom\u00e9ration nouvelle'', or SAN), a category being phased out\n\n==== Overseas regions ====\nFive [[Overseas regions of France|Overseas Regions]] (''r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer'', or ROM), which have the same status as metropolitan regions. The Overseas Regions are following:\n# [[Martinique]]\n# [[Guadeloupe]]\n# [[French Guiana]]\n# [[R\u00e9union]]\n# [[Mayotte]]\n\n* Each overseas region is coextensive with an [[Overseas departments of France|overseas department]] (''d\u00e9partement d'outre-mer'', or DOM), again with the same status as departments in metropolitan France. The first four overseas departments were created in 1946 and preceded the four overseas regions, Mayotte became a DOM in 2011. The dual structure overseas region/overseas department, with two separate assemblies administering the same territory, results from the extension of the regional scheme to the overseas departments in the 1970s. Each overseas region/department may transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies, but voters in Martinique and Guadeloupe rejected this in two referendums in 2003. In R\u00e9union the creation of a second department for the southern part of the island has been debated for some time.\n* The overseas departments are subdivided into 12 arrondissements. (Mayotte does not have arrondissements.)\n* The 12 arrondissements are further subdivided into 153 cantons with Mayotte having another 19 cantons\n* The 172 cantons are composed of 129 communes. (In the five DOM, there are more cantons than communes, unlike in metropolitan France, because many communes are divided into several cantons, whereas in metropolitan France in general cantons are made up of several communes, except in large communes like Toulouse or Lille which are divided into several cantons.)\n*Furthermore, as of 1 January 2009, there exist 16 intercommunal structures in the overseas departments, grouping 89 communes (79.5% of all the communes of the overseas departments), with 83.2% of the population of the overseas departments living in them intercommunal structures.<ref name=DGCl_source /> These intercommunal structures are:\n**7 Agglomeration communities\n**9 Commune communities\n\n=== Overseas collectivities, semi-autonomous territories ===\n[[File:France Overseas Collectivities.svg|thumb|400px|The five [[overseas collectivities of France]]]]\n{{main|Overseas departments and territories of France}}\nThe French Republic includes five [[Overseas collectivities of France|overseas collectivities]] (''collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer'', or COM) with a semi-autonomous status: \n\n# [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint-Martin]]\n# [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]]\n# [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]]\n# [[French Polynesia]]\n# [[Wallis and Futuna]]\n\n*Saint-Martin (designated as a \"collectivity\", French: ''collectivit\u00e9'') is also a new overseas collectivity created on 22 February 2007. It was also previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe department. The commune structure was abolished and Saint-Martin is now one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no [[communes of France|commune]] structure. There are also no cantons or arrondissements.\n*Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy (designated as a \"collectivity\", French: ''collectivit\u00e9'') is a new overseas collectivity created on 22 February 2007. It was previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe department. The commune structure was abolished and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy is now one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no [[communes of France|commune]] structure. There are no cantons and arrondissements either.\n*Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (designated as a \"territorial collectivity\", French: ''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale'', the same designation as Corsica which is a region and not an overseas collectivity) is divided into 2 communes with no arrondissements or cantons.\n*French Polynesia (designated as an \"[[Overseas country of France|overseas country]]\", French: ''pays d'outre-mer'') is divided into 5 administrative subdivisions (''subdivisions administratives''). For elections, it is divided into 6 electoral districts (''circonscriptions \u00e9lectorales''), which differ slightly from the 5 administrative subdivisions. The 5 administrative subdivisions are divided into 48 communes. There also exist some [[Associated communes of France|associated communes]] as in metropolitan France.\n*Wallis and Futuna (designated as a \"territory\", French: ''territoire'') is divided into 3 districts (''circonscriptions territoriales''), which exactly match the three traditional chiefdoms (''royaumes coutumiers'') with their traditional kings still at their head, the only kings currently recognized in the French Republic. These 3 districts are [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|Uvea]], [[Sigave]], and [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]]. Uvea is the most populous and is further divided into 3 wards (''districts'' in French): [[Hahake District|Hahake]], [[Mua District|Mua]], and [[Hihifo District|Hihifo]]. Wallis and Futuna is one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no communes (the others being Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint-Martin). It also has no arrondissements or cantons.\n\n=== New Caledonia, an autonomous territory ===\nThe French Republic includes one [[Overseas departments and territories of France#Special collectivity|autonomous collectivity]]: \n# [[New Caledonia]]\n\nNew Caledonia's status is unique in the French Republic: it is the only French local government which is not a [[territorial collectivity]] (although its subdivisions are territorial collectivities). It is regarded as a [[Sui generis collectivity]], which means that local government and parliament have the power to pass and enforce specific laws without seeking consent of the French Government; unless such laws are declared illegitimate by the Constitutional Council in specific proceeding brought to the Constitutional Council.  As agreed in the 1998 [[Noum\u00e9a Accord]], a New Caledonian citizenship was established (in addition to the French citizenship which is kept in parallel, along with the consequent European citizenship) and a [[2018 New Caledonian independence referendum|self-determination referendum was held in 2018]].\n*It is divided into 3 provinces.\n*The provinces are subdivided into 33 communes.\n\n=== Territories without civilian population ===\nThese territories have no permanent civilian population. The residents consist of military personnel, scientific researchers and support staff.\n\n====Overseas territory====\n1 [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] (''territoire d'outre-mer'', or TOM): the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], which have no permanent population and no communes.\n*The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are divided into 5 districts  (''districts'' in French):\n*# [[Kerguelen Islands]]\n*# [[Crozet Islands]]\n*# [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]] and [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|Saint Paul Island]]\n*# [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]]\n*# The [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|Scattered Islands]] (''\u00celes \u00c9parses''), a collection of six non permanently inhabited islands in the [[Indian Ocean]]: [[Banc du Geyser]], [[Bassas da India]], [[Europa Island|Europa]], [[Juan de Nova Island|Juan de Nova]], [[Glorioso Islands|Glorioso]], and [[Tromelin Island|Tromelin]]. These were previously administered separately but they have been joined with the French Southern and Antarctic Lands since February 2007.\n\n====Uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France====\n*[[Clipperton Island]]: uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of [[Mexico]] which is directly under the authority of the [[Minister of the Overseas (France)|Minister of the Overseas]] in [[Paris]] (until February 2007 it was administered by the high-commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia). Since the Scattered Islands were joined with the French Southern and Antarctic Lands also in February 2007, Clipperton Island is now the only island left in this category.\n\n== Territorial collectivities ==\n{{main|Decentralisation in France}}\n\nFrench subdivisions that have a (limited) freedom of administration are called [[Territorial collectivities of France|territorial collectivities]]. Among them are regions, departments, communes, overseas collectivities, provinces (only present in New Caledonia) and the territorial collectivity of Corsica which belongs to no category (but is usually grouped with the regions). New Caledonia is unique as it is not a territorial collectivity.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==General rules==\nCitizens from all parts of France, including the overseas administrative divisions, vote in national elections ([[President of France|presidential]], [[French National Assembly|legislative]]), and all of the collectivities are represented in the [[Senate of France|Senate]].\n\n== List of departments by region ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* '''[[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]'''\n** 01 [[Ain]]\n** 03 [[Allier]]\n** 07 [[Ard\u00e8che]]\n** 15 [[Cantal]]\n** 26 [[Dr\u00f4me]]\n** 38 [[Is\u00e8re]]\n** 42 [[Loire (department)|Loire]]\n** 43 [[Haute-Loire]]\n** 63 [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]]\n** 69D [[Rh\u00f4ne (department)|Rh\u00f4ne]]\n** 69M [[Lyon Metropolis]]\n** 73 [[Savoie]]\n** 74 [[Haute-Savoie]]\n* '''[[Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9]]'''\n** 21 [[C\u00f4te-d'Or]]\n** 25 [[Doubs]]\n** 39 [[Jura (department)|Jura]]\n** 58 [[Ni\u00e8vre]]\n** 70 [[Haute-Sa\u00f4ne]]\n** 71 [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]]\n** 89 [[Yonne]]\n** 90 [[Territoire de Belfort]]\n* '''[[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] (''Bretagne'')'''\n** 22 [[C\u00f4tes-d'Armor]]\n** 29 [[Finist\u00e8re]]\n** 35 [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]\n** 56 [[Morbihan]]\n* '''[[Centre-Val de Loire]]'''\n** 18 [[Cher (department)|Cher]]\n** 28 [[Eure-et-Loir]]\n** 36 [[Indre]]\n** 37 [[Indre-et-Loire]]\n** 41 [[Loir-et-Cher]]\n** 45 [[Loiret]]\n* '''[[Corsica]] (''Corse'')'''\n** 2A [[Corse-du-Sud]]\n** 2B [[Haute-Corse]]\n* '''[[\u00cele-de-France]]'''\n** 75 [[Paris]]\n** 77 [[Seine-et-Marne]]\n** 78 [[Yvelines]]\n** 91 [[Essonne]]\n** 92 [[Hauts-de-Seine]]\n** 93 [[Seine-Saint-Denis]]\n** 94 [[Val-de-Marne]]\n** 95 [[Val-d'Oise]]\n* '''[[Grand Est]]'''\n** 08 [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]]\n** 10 [[Aube]]\n** 51 [[Marne (department)|Marne]]\n** 52 [[Haute-Marne]]\n** 54 [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]]\n** 55 [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]\n** 57 [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]\n** 67 [[Bas-Rhin]]\n** 68 [[Haut-Rhin]]\n** 88 [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]]\n* '''[[Hauts-de-France]]'''\n** 02 [[Aisne]]\n** 59 [[Nord (French department)|Nord]]\n** 60 [[Oise]]\n** 62 [[Pas-de-Calais]]\n** 80 [[Somme (department)|Somme]]\n* '''[[Normandy]] (''Normandie'')'''\n** 14 [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]\n** 27 [[Eure]]\n** 50 [[Manche]]\n** 61 [[Orne]]\n** 76 [[Seine-Maritime]]\n* '''[[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]]'''\n** 16 [[Charente]]\n** 17 [[Charente-Maritime]]\n** 19 [[Corr\u00e8ze]]\n** 23 [[Creuse]]\n** 24 [[Dordogne]]\n** 33 [[Gironde]]\n** 40 [[Landes (department)|Landes]]\n** 47 [[Lot-et-Garonne]]\n** 64 [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]]\n** 79 [[Deux-S\u00e8vres]]\n** 86 [[Vienne]]\n** 87 [[Haute-Vienne]]\n* '''[[Occitanie]]\n** 09 [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]\n** 11 [[Aude]]\n** 12 [[Aveyron]]\n** 30 [[Gard]]\n** 31 [[Haute-Garonne]]\n** 32 [[Gers]]\n** 34 [[H\u00e9rault]]\n** 46 [[Lot (department)|Lot]]\n** 48 [[Loz\u00e8re]]\n** 65 [[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]\n** 66 [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]]\n** 81 [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]]\n** 82 [[Tarn-et-Garonne]]\n* '''[[Pays de la Loire]]'''\n** 44 [[Loire-Atlantique]]\n** 49 [[Maine-et-Loire]]\n** 53 [[Mayenne]]\n** 72 [[Sarthe]]\n** 85 [[Vend\u00e9e]]\n* '''[[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]'''\n** 04 [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]\n** 05 [[Hautes-Alpes]]\n** 06 [[Alpes-Maritimes]]\n** 13 [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]\n** 83 [[Var (department)|Var]]\n** 84 [[Vaucluse]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n* '''[[Overseas department and region|Overseas departments]]''' (the following are both departments and regions)\n** 971 [[Guadeloupe]]\n** 972 [[Martinique]]\n** 973 [[French Guiana]]\n** 974 [[R\u00e9union]]\n** 976 [[Mayotte]]\n* '''[[Overseas collectivity|Overseas collectivities]]'''\n** 975 [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]\n** 977 [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]]\n** 978 [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\n** 986 [[Wallis and Futuna]]\n** 987 [[French Polynesia]] (was also given the designation of [[overseas country of France|overseas country]])\n* '''''[[Sui generis]]'' collectivity'''\n** 988 [[New Caledonia]]\n* '''[[Overseas territory (France)|Overseas territory]]'''\n** 984 [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] (including France's [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] claim and the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]])\n* '''Special status'''\n** 989 [[Clipperton Island]]\n\n==Historical divisions==\n[[Image:France departements regions narrow.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Regions and departments of France from 1982 to 2015]]\n\nIn the Medieval period, the territory of modern metropolitan France was occupied by a complex mosaic of more or less independent entities.

There are 20 [[arrondissements of Paris]], 16 [[arrondissements of Marseille]], and 9 [[arrondissements of Lyon]].\n** The city of [[Marseille]] is also divided into 8 municipal sectors. Each sector is composed of two arrondissements.\n**There are also 710 [[Associated communes of France|associated communes]] ({{as of|January 2009|lc=yes}}), formerly independent communes which were merged with larger communes but have retained some limited degree of autonomy (e.g. the commune of [[Lomme]] which was absorbed by [[Lille]] in 2000 and transformed into an \"associated commune\" inside the commune of Lille).\n\nFurthermore, {{as of|January 2009|lc=yes}}, there exist 2,585 [[Communes in France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] structures grouping 34,077 communes (93.2% of all the communes of metropolitan France), with 87.4% of the population of metropolitan France living in them.<ref name=DGCl_source>{{cite web| url=http://www.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/statistiques/intercommunalite/bilan_statistique/bilan_statistique_20/view| title=Intercommunalit\u00e9 - Bilan statistique 2009| first=Ministry of the Interior| last=Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des collectivit\u00e9s locales (DGCL)| accessdate=24 March 2009| authorlink=Minister of the Interior (France)| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306153041/http://www.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/statistiques/intercommunalite/bilan_statistique/bilan_statistique_20/view| archivedate=6 March 2009| url-status=dead| language=fr| df=dmy-all}}</ref> These intercommunal structures are:\n*16 [[Urban communities in France|Urban communities]] (''communaut\u00e9s urbaines'', or CU)\n*167 [[Agglomeration communities in France|Agglomeration communities]] (''communaut\u00e9s d'agglom\u00e9ration'', or CA)\n*2,397 [[Commune communities in France|Commune communities]] (''communaut\u00e9s de communes'', or CC)\n*5 Syndicates of New Agglomeration (''syndicats d'agglom\u00e9ration nouvelle'', or SAN), a category being phased out\n\n==== Overseas regions ====\nFive [[Overseas regions of France|Overseas Regions]] (''r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer'', or ROM), which have the same status as metropolitan regions. The Overseas Regions are following:\n# [[Martinique]]\n# [[Guadeloupe]]\n# [[French Guiana]]\n# [[R\u00e9union]]\n# [[Mayotte]]\n\n* Each overseas region is coextensive with an [[Overseas departments of France|overseas department]] (''d\u00e9partement d'outre-mer'', or DOM), again with the same status as departments in metropolitan France. The first four overseas departments were created in 1946 and preceded the four overseas regions, Mayotte became a DOM in 2011. The dual structure overseas region/overseas department, with two separate assemblies administering the same territory, results from the extension of the regional scheme to the overseas departments in the 1970s. Each overseas region/department may transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies, but voters in Martinique and Guadeloupe rejected this in two referendums in 2003. In R\u00e9union the creation of a second department for the southern part of the island has been debated for some time.\n* The overseas departments are subdivided into 12 arrondissements. (Mayotte does not have arrondissements.)\n* The 12 arrondissements are further subdivided into 153 cantons with Mayotte having another 19 cantons\n* The 172 cantons are composed of 129 communes. (In the five DOM, there are more cantons than communes, unlike in metropolitan France, because many communes are divided into several cantons, whereas in metropolitan France in general cantons are made up of several communes, except in large communes like Toulouse or Lille which are divided into several cantons.)\n*Furthermore, as of 1 January 2009, there exist 16 intercommunal structures in the overseas departments, grouping 89 communes (79.5% of all the communes of the overseas departments), with 83.2% of the population of the overseas departments living in them intercommunal structures.<ref name=DGCl_source /> These intercommunal structures are:\n**7 Agglomeration communities\n**9 Commune communities\n\n=== Overseas collectivities, semi-autonomous territories ===\n[[File:France Overseas Collectivities.svg|thumb|400px|The five [[overseas collectivities of France]]]]\n{{main|Overseas departments and territories of France}}\nThe French Republic includes five [[Overseas collectivities of France|overseas collectivities]] (''collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer'', or COM) with a semi-autonomous status: \n\n# [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint-Martin]]\n# [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]]\n# [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]]\n# [[French Polynesia]]\n# [[Wallis and Futuna]]\n\n*Saint-Martin (designated as a \"collectivity\", French: ''collectivit\u00e9'') is also a new overseas collectivity created on 22 February 2007. It was also previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe department. The commune structure was abolished and Saint-Martin is now one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no [[communes of France|commune]] structure. There are also no cantons or arrondissements.\n*Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy (designated as a \"collectivity\", French: ''collectivit\u00e9'') is a new overseas collectivity created on 22 February 2007. It was previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe department. The commune structure was abolished and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy is now one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no [[communes of France|commune]] structure. There are no cantons and arrondissements either.\n*Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (designated as a \"territorial collectivity\", French: ''collectivit\u00e9 territoriale'', the same designation as Corsica which is a region and not an overseas collectivity) is divided into 2 communes with no arrondissements or cantons.\n*French Polynesia (designated as an \"[[Overseas country of France|overseas country]]\", French: ''pays d'outre-mer'') is divided into 5 administrative subdivisions (''subdivisions administratives''). For elections, it is divided into 6 electoral districts (''circonscriptions \u00e9lectorales''), which differ slightly from the 5 administrative subdivisions. The 5 administrative subdivisions are divided into 48 communes. There also exist some [[Associated communes of France|associated communes]] as in metropolitan France.\n*Wallis and Futuna (designated as a \"territory\", French: ''territoire'') is divided into 3 districts (''circonscriptions territoriales''), which exactly match the three traditional chiefdoms (''royaumes coutumiers'') with their traditional kings still at their head, the only kings currently recognized in the French Republic. These 3 districts are [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|Uvea]], [[Sigave]], and [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]]. Uvea is the most populous and is further divided into 3 wards (''districts'' in French): [[Hahake District|Hahake]], [[Mua District|Mua]], and [[Hihifo District|Hihifo]]. Wallis and Futuna is one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no communes (the others being Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint-Martin). It also has no arrondissements or cantons.\n\n=== New Caledonia, an autonomous territory ===\nThe French Republic includes one [[Overseas departments and territories of France#Special collectivity|autonomous collectivity]]: \n# [[New Caledonia]]\n\nNew Caledonia's status is unique in the French Republic: it is the only French local government which is not a [[territorial collectivity]] (although its subdivisions are territorial collectivities). It is regarded as a [[Sui generis collectivity]], which means that local government and parliament have the power to pass and enforce specific laws without seeking consent of the French Government; unless such laws are declared illegitimate by the Constitutional Council in specific proceeding brought to the Constitutional Council.  As agreed in the 1998 [[Noum\u00e9a Accord]], a New Caledonian citizenship was established (in addition to the French citizenship which is kept in parallel, along with the consequent European citizenship) and a [[2018 New Caledonian independence referendum|self-determination referendum was held in 2018]].\n*It is divided into 3 provinces.\n*The provinces are subdivided into 33 communes.\n\n=== Territories without civilian population ===\nThese territories have no permanent civilian population. The residents consist of military personnel, scientific researchers and support staff.\n\n====Overseas territory====\n1 [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] (''territoire d'outre-mer'', or TOM): the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], which have no permanent population and no communes.\n*The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are divided into 5 districts  (''districts'' in French):\n*# [[Kerguelen Islands]]\n*# [[Crozet Islands]]\n*# [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]] and [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|Saint Paul Island]]\n*# [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]]\n*# The [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|Scattered Islands]] (''\u00celes \u00c9parses''), a collection of six non permanently inhabited islands in the [[Indian Ocean]]: [[Banc du Geyser]], [[Bassas da India]], [[Europa Island|Europa]], [[Juan de Nova Island|Juan de Nova]], [[Glorioso Islands|Glorioso]], and [[Tromelin Island|Tromelin]]. These were previously administered separately but they have been joined with the French Southern and Antarctic Lands since February 2007.\n\n====Uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France====\n*[[Clipperton Island]]: uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of [[Mexico]] which is directly under the authority of the [[Minister of the Overseas (France)|Minister of the Overseas]] in [[Paris]] (until February 2007 it was administered by the high-commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia). Since the Scattered Islands were joined with the French Southern and Antarctic Lands also in February 2007, Clipperton Island is now the only island left in this category.\n\n== Territorial collectivities ==\n{{main|Decentralisation in France}}\n\nFrench subdivisions that have a (limited) freedom of administration are called [[Territorial collectivities of France|territorial collectivities]]. Among them are regions, departments, communes, overseas collectivities, provinces (only present in New Caledonia) and the territorial collectivity of Corsica which belongs to no category (but is usually grouped with the regions). New Caledonia is unique as it is not a territorial collectivity.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==General rules==\nCitizens from all parts of France, including the overseas administrative divisions, vote in national elections ([[President of France|presidential]], [[French National Assembly|legislative]]), and all of the collectivities are represented in the [[Senate of France|Senate]].\n\n== List of departments by region ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* '''[[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]'''\n** 01 [[Ain]]\n** 03 [[Allier]]\n** 07 [[Ard\u00e8che]]\n** 15 [[Cantal]]\n** 26 [[Dr\u00f4me]]\n** 38 [[Is\u00e8re]]\n** 42 [[Loire (department)|Loire]]\n** 43 [[Haute-Loire]]\n** 63 [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]]\n** 69 [[Rh\u00f4ne (department)|Rh\u00f4ne]]\n** 73 [[Savoie]]\n** 74 [[Haute-Savoie]]\n* '''[[Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9]]'''\n** 21 [[C\u00f4te-d'Or]]\n** 25 [[Doubs]]\n** 39 [[Jura (department)|Jura]]\n** 58 [[Ni\u00e8vre]]\n** 70 [[Haute-Sa\u00f4ne]]\n** 71 [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]]\n** 89 [[Yonne]]\n** 90 [[Territoire de Belfort]]\n* '''[[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] (''Bretagne'')'''\n** 22 [[C\u00f4tes-d'Armor]]\n** 29 [[Finist\u00e8re]]\n** 35 [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]\n** 56 [[Morbihan]]\n* '''[[Centre-Val de Loire]]'''\n** 18 [[Cher (department)|Cher]]\n** 28 [[Eure-et-Loir]]\n** 36 [[Indre]]\n** 37 [[Indre-et-Loire]]\n** 41 [[Loir-et-Cher]]\n** 45 [[Loiret]]\n* '''[[Corsica]] (''Corse'')'''\n** 2A [[Corse-du-Sud]]\n** 2B [[Haute-Corse]]\n* '''[[\u00cele-de-France]]'''\n** 75 [[Paris]]\n** 77 [[Seine-et-Marne]]\n** 78 [[Yvelines]]\n** 91 [[Essonne]]\n** 92 [[Hauts-de-Seine]]\n** 93 [[Seine-Saint-Denis]]\n** 94 [[Val-de-Marne]]\n** 95 [[Val-d'Oise]]\n* '''[[Grand Est]]'''\n** 08 [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]]\n** 10 [[Aube]]\n** 51 [[Marne (department)|Marne]]\n** 52 [[Haute-Marne]]\n** 54 [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]]\n** 55 [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]]\n** 57 [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]\n** 67 [[Bas-Rhin]]\n** 68 [[Haut-Rhin]]\n** 88 [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]]\n* '''[[Hauts-de-France]]'''\n** 02 [[Aisne]]\n** 59 [[Nord (French department)|Nord]]\n** 60 [[Oise]]\n** 62 [[Pas-de-Calais]]\n** 80 [[Somme (department)|Somme]]\n* '''[[Normandy]] (''Normandie'')'''\n** 14 [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]\n** 27 [[Eure]]\n** 50 [[Manche]]\n** 61 [[Orne]]\n** 76 [[Seine-Maritime]]\n* '''[[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]]'''\n** 16 [[Charente]]\n** 17 [[Charente-Maritime]]\n** 19 [[Corr\u00e8ze]]\n** 23 [[Creuse]]\n** 24 [[Dordogne]]\n** 33 [[Gironde]]\n** 40 [[Landes (department)|Landes]]\n** 47 [[Lot-et-Garonne]]\n** 64 [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]]\n** 79 [[Deux-S\u00e8vres]]\n** 86 [[Vienne]]\n** 87 [[Haute-Vienne]]\n* '''[[Occitanie]]\n** 09 [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]]\n** 11 [[Aude]]\n** 12 [[Aveyron]]\n** 30 [[Gard]]\n** 31 [[Haute-Garonne]]\n** 32 [[Gers]]\n** 34 [[H\u00e9rault]]\n** 46 [[Lot (department)|Lot]]\n** 48 [[Loz\u00e8re]]\n** 65 [[Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]\n** 66 [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales]]\n** 81 [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]]\n** 82 [[Tarn-et-Garonne]]\n* '''[[Pays de la Loire]]'''\n** 44 [[Loire-Atlantique]]\n** 49 [[Maine-et-Loire]]\n** 53 [[Mayenne]]\n** 72 [[Sarthe]]\n** 85 [[Vend\u00e9e]]\n* '''[[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]'''\n** 04 [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]\n** 05 [[Hautes-Alpes]]\n** 06 [[Alpes-Maritimes]]\n** 13 [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]\n** 83 [[Var (department)|Var]]\n** 84 [[Vaucluse]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n* '''[[Overseas department and region|Overseas departments]]''' (the following are both departments and regions)\n** 971 [[Guadeloupe]]\n** 972 [[Martinique]]\n** 973 [[French Guiana]]\n** 974 [[R\u00e9union]]\n** 976 [[Mayotte]]\n* '''[[Overseas collectivity|Overseas collectivities]]'''\n** 975 [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]\n** 977 [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]]\n** 978 [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\n** 986 [[Wallis and Futuna]]\n** 987 [[French Polynesia]] (was also given the designation of [[overseas country of France|overseas country]])\n* '''''[[Sui generis]]'' collectivity'''\n** 988 [[New Caledonia]]\n* '''[[Overseas territory (France)|Overseas territory]]'''\n** 984 [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] (including France's [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] claim and the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]])\n* '''Special status'''\n** 989 [[Clipperton Island]]\n\n==Historical divisions==\n[[Image:France departements regions narrow.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Regions and departments of France from 1982 to 2015]]\n\nIn the Medieval period, the territory of modern metropolitan France was occupied by a complex mosaic of more or less independent entities.

At that time, the WWF featured an [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] (a fictional storyline) in which all the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] in the promotion competed to offer their services to [[Randy Savage|Macho Man Randy Savage]].<ref name=owow/> During a match on July 30, 1985 in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], several managers were at ringside in hopes that he would name one of them as his new manager. After the match, Savage thanked the managers for their consideration and then asked that his new manager come to ringside.<ref name=owow/> An attractive, unnamed woman then came down to the ring, and announcer [[Bruno Sammartino]] remarked, \"She must be some sort of movie star,\" referring to her glamorous sex appeal.<ref name=owow/> It was later revealed that her name was Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth's WWF debut was taped on July 30, 1985 and aired on the August 24, 1985 edition of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]''.<ref name=owow/> From that point on, she was the manager of Randy Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/85.htm|title=WWF @ Poughkeepsie, NY \u2013 Mid-Hudson Civic Center \u2013 July 30, 1985|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=November 4, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018061048/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/85.htm |archivedate = October 18, 2007}}</ref>  On February 8, 1986 at the [[Boston Garden]] she was in Savage's corner as he defeated [[Tito Santana]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]].\n\nMiss Elizabeth's first major angle was during Savage's feud with [[George Steele|George \"The Animal\" Steele]] in 1986.<ref name=owow/> In the angle, Steele fell in love with Elizabeth, angering Savage and leading to a series of grudge matches between him and Steele.<ref name=owow/> Their feud was one of the WWF's most popular of the 1980s; it carried on for more than a year, thanks to the feral Steele's continued innocent crush on Elizabeth.<ref name=owow/>\n\nAfter injuring [[Ricky Steamboat]]'s [[larynx]], Savage lost his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]] to Steamboat at [[WrestleMania III]] on March 29, 1987.<ref name=owow/> Steamboat later lost the title to [[The Honky Tonk Man]]. Honky's insistence that he was \"the greatest Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion of all time\" instigated a challenge from Savage, the former champion.<ref name=owow/> In their match, which aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XII]]'' on [[NBC]], Honky shoved Elizabeth to the mat before assaulting Savage with a guitar. Elizabeth ran backstage and persuaded [[Hulk Hogan]] to rescue Savage. Savage and Hogan formed [[The Mega Powers]], running off Honky and his allies, [[Bret Hart|Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart|Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart]].<ref name=owow/>\n\nThroughout the Savage-Honky feud, a key point was Honky's claim that Elizabeth secretly wanted him more than Savage.<ref name=owow/> In several of their matches, Honky would try to corner Elizabeth, although Savage would always beat him back. In other Savage-Honky matches, a woman named Peggy Sue (usually [[Sherri Martel]], or a dressed-up [[Jimmy Hart|Jimmy \"Mouth of the South\" Hart]]) would harass Elizabeth at ringside, creating an advantage for Honky.<ref name=owow/> At the 1987 [[Slammy Awards]], Honky named Elizabeth \"Woman of the Year,\" but the honor was only to harass her and anger Savage; Savage quickly ran Honky off.<ref name=owow/>\n\n====1988\u20131989====\n[[File:Miss Elizabeth running.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Miss Elizabeth played a central role in the storyline between [[WrestleMania IV]] and [[WrestleMania V]].]]\nThe year 1988 was a pivotal one for Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth. Hulk Hogan, who had been the champion and the foundation upon which the WWF's popularity was built, lost the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] in a match against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref name=owow/> Andr\u00e9 then sold the belt to the \"Million Dollar Man\" [[Ted DiBiase]] due to an arrangement that they had prior to the match.<ref name=owow/> [[Professional wrestling authority figures#President|President]] [[Jack Tunney]] declared that the title cannot be forfeited to another individual.<ref name=owow/> A tournament was held at [[WrestleMania IV]] to declare a new champion, which Macho Man Randy Savage won, pinning DiBiase (with Hogan's help) in the finals.<ref name=owow/>\n\nAt the first ever [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam]], [[The Mega Powers]] teamed up against Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Ted DiBiase, [[The Mega Bucks]] with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.<ref name=owow/> Most of the pre-match build-up centered on Elizabeth, who by this time was at the peak of her popularity.<ref name=owow/> The tease for the match was that if things got bad, Elizabeth, billed as the secret weapon of The Mega Powers, was going to wear sexy red [[panties]] under her fancy clothes.<ref name=owow/> Towards the end of match, Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase were in control, so Elizabeth got up on the apron and ripped her [[skirt]] off to reveal her panties which distracted Andr\u00e9, DiBiase and Ventura, giving Savage and Hogan time to recover after being knocked out of the ring. After the match, during the celebration, Hulk Hogan touched Elizabeth's butt. <ref name=owow/> \n\nElizabeth became the catalyst in the uneasy \u2013 and ultimate breakup of \u2013 the Savage\u2013Hogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan's overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth.<ref name=owow/> At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches during the fall of 1988, including matches against [[Tonga Fifita|King Haku]], [[One Man Gang|Akeem]], and [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] that aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XVII]]''.<ref name=owow/> In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth's safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] and Akeem's tag-team partner, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|The Big Boss Man]] (who wrestled together as The Twin Towers) when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climatic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth's well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan.<ref name=owow/> \n\nConcurrent with the Mega Powers' feud with the Twin Towers was Savage's feud with Bad News Brown.<ref name=owow/> That feud started when Brown, during a guest appearance on \"[[Bruce Prichard|The Brother Love Show]]\" talk segment, alleged that Elizabeth was \"doing favors\" for WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] (implying she wanted to protect Savage and his WWF World Heavyweight Championship reign from Brown). Savage quickly got revenge against Brown.\n\nThe tension between Hogan and Savage continued to build at the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|1989 Royal Rumble]] when Hogan \"accidentally\" eliminated Savage. A hot Savage then confronted Hogan in the ring, causing Elizabeth to rush to the ring to play the role of peacemaker. After the match was over, Jesse Ventura interviewed Savage and claimed he could see problems between The Mega Powers, something Savage unconvincingly denied.\n\nMeanwhile, tension continued to build within the Mega Powers, and on ''[[The Main Event II]]'', aired live on February 3, 1989, Savage could no longer contain his growing anger toward Hogan. The sequence of events began when Akeem threw Savage onto Elizabeth, who was knocked unconscious from the force of the blow. Hogan immediately ran to Elizabeth's aid and, distraught and fearing the worst, carried her to the backstage area for medical attention; the match continued in the meantime, with Akeem and Big Boss Man working Savage over. Elizabeth eventually regained consciousness and asked Hogan to return to the ring. However, Savage, furious over being left to take a beating, [[Slap (professional wrestling)|slapped]] Hogan in the face and, after having some choice words, left him to face the Twin Towers alone. (Hogan eventually won the match single handed). Following the match backstage, Savage and Hogan had a loud verbal argument while Elizabeth was receiving medical attention, which culminated with Savage blindsiding Hogan with the championship belt and beating him.\n\nIn the buildup to the Hogan-Savage main event match at [[WrestleMania V]], Savage appeared in a series of televised promos accusing Hogan of \"lusting after Elizabeth\" with video footage of past incidents, edited in a context to push Hogan as a jealous, sore heel. Hogan responded by defending his behavior (with more complete footage from the same incidents, to push him as the face). After weeks of speculation as to whose corner she would stand in at WrestleMania V, Elizabeth announced she would stand in a \"neutral\" corner. During the Hogan-Savage match, Elizabeth got in the way of both wrestlers several times and was eventually sent from ringside; Hogan went on to win Savage's WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nFollowing WrestleMania V, Savage replaced Miss Elizabeth in favor of [[Sensational Sherri]].\n\nFor the remainder of 1989, Elizabeth's appearances were very sporadic. She continued to mainly appear on the house show circuit managing Hulk Hogan in his matches with Randy Savage from April through October 1989.  Elizabeth appeared at [[SummerSlam (1989)|the 1989 SummerSlam]], managing Hogan and Brutus Beefcake as they headlined the show against Savage and [[Tom Lister Jr.|Zeus]] (who appeared with Sensational Sherri); Elizabeth, who rarely became physical with other wrestlers beforehand, tripped Sherri during a critical point in the match.  Elizabeth also briefly co-hosted ''[[WWF Wrestling Spotlight]]'' with [[Vince McMahon]]. Savage remained a heel for many more months, eventually dubbing himself \"The Macho King\" after defeating [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] for the WWF's \"King of the Ring\" title in August of 1989.  Elizabeth closed out 1989 managing Jim Duggan in his matches against Randy Savage and appearing on the Brother Love Show during house shows with Sherri Martel in November and December 1989.\n\n====1990\u20131992====\nAfter Savage and Sherri began a heated feud with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|\"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Juanita Wright|Sapphire]] near the end of 1989, Miss Elizabeth joined forces with Rhodes and Sapphire at [[WrestleMania VI]], where the two couples were engaged in the WWF's first mixed tag-team match. When Sherri attempted to help Savage double-team Rhodes, Miss Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair. While the two women faced off, Sapphire took advantage of the situation, kneeling down behind Sherri just as Miss Elizabeth pushed her. Sherri lost her balance and gave Sapphire enough advantage to pin Sherri for the win.<ref>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|author=Shields, Brian and Kevin Sullivan|publisher=DK/BradyGAMES|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/265 265]|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/265}}</ref>  Elizabeth continued to appear on the house show circuit with Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire from May 1990 through August 1990 in mixed tag team matches against Randy Savage and Sherri Martel.  From June through August 1990, Randy and Sherri had Brother Love in their corner to counter-act Elizabeth.\n\nMiss Elizabeth disappeared from WWF television until March 24, 1991 [[WrestleMania VII]], when Savage lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]] to [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. Upon his loss, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth, who was sitting at ringside, entered the ring and defended Savage. Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair and threw her out of the ring, reuniting Savage and Elizabeth.<ref name=\"wwebio\"/> Macho Man punctuated the reunion by holding down the ropes for Elizabeth after years of her doing it for him.\n\nOn June 17, 1991 during the taping of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' in an in-ring segment with [[Gene Okerlund]] announcing, [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] proposed to Miss Elizabeth, which she accepted. The couple then held a heavily promoted on-air wedding billed as \"The Match Made in Heaven\" on August 26, 1991 at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam 1991]] (the couple were officially married on December 30, 1984).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=WrestleView |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/info/diduknow.shtml |title=Did You Know?!? |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329115919/http://www.wrestleview.com/info/diduknow.shtml |archivedate=March 29, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the wedding reception, Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live [[snake]], which frightened her; newly-turned-heel [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] and [[The Undertaker]] crashed the reception and attacked Savage. This started a feud between Roberts and Savage, where Elizabeth quickly figured prominently. The first high-profile Savage-Roberts match was on December 3, 1991 at the [[This Tuesday in Texas|Tuesday in Texas]] pay-per-view event, where, after Savage gained a pinfall victory, Roberts beat down Savage, then forced Elizabeth to beg him to stop the beating. Apparently dissatisfied with her begging, Roberts grabbed her by the hair and slapped her across her face. On the February 8, 1992 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]'', Roberts, with a steel chair in tow, was waiting in the backstage area for Elizabeth and Savage to come through the curtain after a match. Roberts was about to strike Elizabeth with the chair, but Undertaker stopped him. This started Undertaker's feud with his former ally.\n\nIn her final WWF angle, WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Ric Flair]] bragged that he dated Elizabeth before Savage met her. Flair's [[tagline]] was, \"She was mine before she was yours.\" He showed photos of himself with Elizabeth in casual situations, which were later printed in an issue of ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]''. It was later revealed that the photos were in fact pictures of Savage and Elizabeth, which Flair had doctored.  Flair, with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] as his \"executive consultant\", said that they were going to show a nude photo of Elizabeth on the screen at [[WrestleMania VIII]], although this did not occur. Nonetheless, Flair's claims set up his WrestleMania VIII match with Savage. During the match on April 5, 1992, Elizabeth made her way to ringside, against the wishes of WWF officials. After Savage pinned Flair to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, an angry Flair cornered Elizabeth and began to kiss her; Elizabeth slapped Flair away, and Savage began beating Flair until ring officials broke the two up. Elizabeth's final WWF appearance took place at [[UK Rampage (1992)|UK Rampage]] on April 19, 1992 during an overseas tour of England; in that match, Savage pinned [[Shawn Michaels]] after Elizabeth, who had earlier been sent backstage, returned to prevent Sherri's interference on Michaels' behalf. Until the Savage-Michaels match from England was aired on ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]'' in June; the publication of the actual Savage-Elizabeth photos in ''WWF Magazine'' came at about that same time.\n\nIn August 1992, she and Savage divorced. After the decree was finalized late that summer, Savage issued a statement that was printed in ''WWF Magazine'' revealing that he and Elizabeth were no longer together, and thanking the fans for their support through the years. The publication of Savage's statement marked, at the time, a rare acknowledgement of the wrestlers' private lives for both the WWF and its flagship publication. Savage continued with the WWF for two more years, and except for the statement in ''WWF Magazine'', his divorce from Elizabeth was neither referred to nor figured into any of Savage's future feuds.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling===\n\n====1996\u20131998====\n[[File:Miss Elizabeth Nitro 1998.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Miss Elizabeth in 1998 after a taping of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''.]]\nOn January 23, 1996, Miss Elizabeth returned to wrestling as manager for Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan at Clash of the Champions XXXII. Only 3 weeks later, on February 11, 1996 Elizabeth turned on Randy Savage by helping [[Ric Flair]] defeat him at [[SuperBrawl VI]] and then became Flair's co-manager in the [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] along with [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]].\n\nIn September 1996 Elizabeth joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) alongside Hulk Hogan, but seemed to still care deeply for her ex-husband, and eventually joined his side when he too joined the nWo in February 1997. During much of 1997, Randy Savage and Elizabeth feuded with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Kimberly Page]]. In June 1998, she parted ways with Savage once again by joining Black and White nWo: nWo Hollywood. Then, she accompanied [[Eric Bischoff]] on his way to the ring for the next few months, and derided Savage. Savage coldly reminded her that he \"got over her a long time ago\" and didn't need her.\n\n====1999====\nOn the January 4 episode of ''Nitro'', Elizabeth was seen talking to police detectives. According to the storyline, she claimed that [[Bill Goldberg]] was [[stalking]] her and that he even accosted her by the water cooler. She then filed charges against Goldberg. Goldberg was arrested later that night for aggravated stalking and taken into custody by police. However, later that night, Elizabeth admitted that she was lying. As it turned out, Elizabeth was a pawn for the nWo so that Goldberg would be unable to have his scheduled title match with [[Kevin Nash]] later that night. Due to Goldberg's apparent absence, the returning Hulk Hogan [[Fingerpoke of Doom|took Goldberg's title shot in the match]].\n\nSoon after, Elizabeth accompanied [[Lex Luger]]. Lex Luger, who was accompanied by Elizabeth at this time to ringside for single matches, was supposed to get ready for the tag team match against [[Konnan]] and [[Rey Mysterio Jr.]] with Miss Elizabeth's hair on the line and Rey Mysterio Jr.'s mask on the line at [[SuperBrawl IX]] with Kevin Nash as his tag team partner. However, on the February 18, 1999 edition of ''[[WCW Thunder]]'', at the [[Maverik Center|E-Center]] in Salt Lake City, Utah, a [[limousine|limo]] pulled up and was driving along with Rey Mysterio Jr. with Lex Luger and Elizabeth inside. As Elizabeth and Lex Luger were getting out of the limo, Rey Mysterio Jr. grabbed the door and slammed it into Lex Luger's [[biceps]], injuring him in the process. Lex Luger was immediately replaced by [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] as Kevin Nash's tag team partner for the tag team match at [[Superbrawl IX]].\n\nShe then took time off from the road to be with Lex Luger during his recovery from a biceps injury.\n\nAfter Lex Luger recovered from his biceps injury, Elizabeth would make her return to WCW programming on the September 27, 1999 edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''. Towards the end of 1999, Elizabeth became much more physically involved in the action than she had ever been. Her new vicious side would be ever so apparent at [[Starrcade 1999]] when she struck [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] with his own baseball bat.\n\n====2000====\nIn February, Elizabeth managed the short-lived partnership between Lex Luger and Ric Flair. The three of them were known as Team Package. Shortly thereafter, Team Package went their separate ways as they fought various members of [[The New Blood]].\n\nElizabeth engaged in short-lived feuds with [[Vince Russo]] and [[Kimberly Page]]. On May 8, 2000, Elizabeth wrestled in her first official match against [[Daffney]]. Elizabeth worked with Kimberly Page for the remainder of May 2000.\n\nElizabeth's final WCW appearance was on the May 29, 2000 edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' and Elizabeth quietly left [[World Championship Wrestling]] on August 17, 2000 when her contract expired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Elizabeth/00Update.htm|title=Miss Elizabeth 2000 Updates|publisher=Official Women Of Wrestling|accessdate=November 4, 2007|date=August 17, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nElizabeth briefly married Cary Lubetsky, a [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]] attorney, on December 6, 1997.

After the match, Savage thanked the managers for their consideration and then asked that his new manager come to ringside.<ref name=owow/> An attractive, unnamed woman then came down to the ring, and announcer [[Bruno Sammartino]] remarked, \"She must be some sort of movie star,\" referring to her glamorous sex appeal.<ref name=owow/> It was later revealed that her name was Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth's WWF debut was taped on July 30, 1985 and aired on the August 24, 1985 edition of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]''.<ref name=owow/> From that point on, she was the manager of Randy Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/85.htm|title=WWF @ Poughkeepsie, NY \u2013 Mid-Hudson Civic Center \u2013 July 30, 1985|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=November 4, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018061048/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/85.htm |archivedate = October 18, 2007}}</ref>  On February 8, 1986 at the [[Boston Garden]] she was in Savage's corner as he defeated [[Tito Santana]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]].\n\nMiss Elizabeth's first major angle was during Savage's feud with [[George Steele|George \"The Animal\" Steele]] in 1986.<ref name=owow/> In the angle, Steele fell in love with Elizabeth, angering Savage and leading to a series of grudge matches between him and Steele.<ref name=owow/> Their feud was one of the WWF's most popular of the 1980s; it carried on for more than a year, thanks to the feral Steele's continued innocent crush on Elizabeth.<ref name=owow/>\n\nAfter injuring [[Ricky Steamboat]]'s [[larynx]], Savage lost his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Title]] to Steamboat at [[WrestleMania III]] on March 29, 1987.<ref name=owow/> Steamboat later lost the title to [[The Honky Tonk Man]]. Honky's insistence that he was \"the greatest Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion of all time\" instigated a challenge from Savage, the former champion.<ref name=owow/> In their match, which aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XII]]'' on [[NBC]], Honky shoved Elizabeth to the mat before assaulting Savage with a guitar. Elizabeth ran backstage and persuaded [[Hulk Hogan]] to rescue Savage. Savage and Hogan formed [[The Mega Powers]], running off Honky and his allies, [[Bret Hart|Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart|Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart]].<ref name=owow/>\n\nThroughout the Savage-Honky feud, a key point was Honky's claim that Elizabeth secretly wanted him more than Savage.<ref name=owow/> In several of their matches, Honky would try to corner Elizabeth, although Savage would always beat him back. In other Savage-Honky matches, a woman named Peggy Sue (usually [[Sherri Martel]], or a dressed-up [[Jimmy Hart|Jimmy \"Mouth of the South\" Hart]]) would harass Elizabeth at ringside, creating an advantage for Honky.<ref name=owow/> At the 1987 [[Slammy Awards]], Honky named Elizabeth \"Woman of the Year,\" but the honor was only to harass her and anger Savage; Savage quickly ran Honky off.<ref name=owow/>\n\n====1988\u20131989====\n[[File:Miss Elizabeth running.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Miss Elizabeth played a central role in the storyline between [[WrestleMania IV]] and [[WrestleMania V]].]]\nThe year 1988 was a pivotal one for Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth. Hulk Hogan, who had been the champion and the foundation upon which the WWF's popularity was built, lost the [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] in a match against [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref name=owow/> Andr\u00e9 then sold the belt to the \"Million Dollar Man\" [[Ted DiBiase]] due to an arrangement that they had prior to the match.<ref name=owow/> [[Professional wrestling authority figures#President|President]] [[Jack Tunney]] declared that the title cannot be forfeited to another individual.<ref name=owow/> A tournament was held at [[WrestleMania IV]] to declare a new champion, which Macho Man Randy Savage won, pinning DiBiase (with Hogan's help) in the finals.<ref name=owow/>\n\nAt the first ever [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam]], [[The Mega Powers]] teamed up against Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Ted DiBiase, [[The Mega Bucks]] with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.<ref name=owow/> Most of the pre-match build-up centered on Elizabeth, who by this time was at the peak of her popularity.<ref name=owow/> The tease for the match was that if things got bad, Elizabeth, billed as the secret weapon of The Mega Powers, was going to wear sexy red [[panties]] under her fancy clothes.<ref name=owow/> Towards the end of match, Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase were in control, so Elizabeth got up on the apron and ripped her [[skirt]] off to reveal her panties which distracted Andr\u00e9, DiBiase and Ventura, giving Savage and Hogan time to recover after being knocked out of the ring.<ref name=owow/> \n\nElizabeth became the catalyst in the uneasy \u2013 and ultimate breakup of \u2013 the Savage\u2013Hogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan's overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth.<ref name=owow/> At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches during the fall of 1988, including matches against [[Tonga Fifita|King Haku]], [[One Man Gang|Akeem]], and [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] that aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XVII]]''.<ref name=owow/> In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth's safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] and Akeem's tag-team partner, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|The Big Boss Man]] (who wrestled together as The Twin Towers) when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climatic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth's well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan.<ref name=owow/> \n\nConcurrent with the Mega Powers' feud with the Twin Towers was Savage's feud with Bad News Brown.<ref name=owow/> That feud started when Brown, during a guest appearance on \"[[Bruce Prichard|The Brother Love Show]]\" talk segment, alleged that Elizabeth was \"doing favors\" for WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] (implying she wanted to protect Savage and his WWF World Heavyweight Championship reign from Brown). Savage quickly got revenge against Brown.\n\nThe tension between Hogan and Savage continued to build at the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|1989 Royal Rumble]] when Hogan \"accidentally\" eliminated Savage. A hot Savage then confronted Hogan in the ring, causing Elizabeth to rush to the ring to play the role of peacemaker. After the match was over, Jesse Ventura interviewed Savage and claimed he could see problems between The Mega Powers, something Savage unconvincingly denied.\n\nMeanwhile, tension continued to build within the Mega Powers, and on ''[[The Main Event II]]'', aired live on February 3, 1989, Savage could no longer contain his growing anger toward Hogan. The sequence of events began when Akeem threw Savage onto Elizabeth, who was knocked unconscious from the force of the blow. Hogan immediately ran to Elizabeth's aid and, distraught and fearing the worst, carried her to the backstage area for medical attention; the match continued in the meantime, with Akeem and Big Boss Man working Savage over. Elizabeth eventually regained consciousness and asked Hogan to return to the ring. However, Savage, furious over being left to take a beating, [[Slap (professional wrestling)|slapped]] Hogan in the face and, after having some choice words, left him to face the Twin Towers alone. (Hogan eventually won the match single handed). Following the match backstage, Savage and Hogan had a loud verbal argument while Elizabeth was receiving medical attention, which culminated with Savage blindsiding Hogan with the championship belt and beating him.\n\nIn the buildup to the Hogan-Savage main event match at [[WrestleMania V]], Savage appeared in a series of televised promos accusing Hogan of \"lusting after Elizabeth\" with video footage of past incidents, edited in a context to push Hogan as a jealous, sore heel. Hogan responded by defending his behavior (with more complete footage from the same incidents, to push him as the face). After weeks of speculation as to whose corner she would stand in at WrestleMania V, Elizabeth announced she would stand in a \"neutral\" corner. During the Hogan-Savage match, Elizabeth got in the way of both wrestlers several times and was eventually sent from ringside; Hogan went on to win Savage's WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nFollowing WrestleMania V, Savage replaced Miss Elizabeth in favor of [[Sensational Sherri]].\n\nFor the remainder of 1989, Elizabeth's appearances were very sporadic. She continued to mainly appear on the house show circuit managing Hulk Hogan in his matches with Randy Savage from April through October 1989.  Elizabeth appeared at [[SummerSlam (1989)|the 1989 SummerSlam]], managing Hogan and Brutus Beefcake as they headlined the show against Savage and [[Tom Lister Jr.|Zeus]] (who appeared with Sensational Sherri); Elizabeth, who rarely became physical with other wrestlers beforehand, tripped Sherri during a critical point in the match.  Elizabeth also briefly co-hosted ''[[WWF Wrestling Spotlight]]'' with [[Vince McMahon]]. Savage remained a heel for many more months, eventually dubbing himself \"The Macho King\" after defeating [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] for the WWF's \"King of the Ring\" title in August of 1989.  Elizabeth closed out 1989 managing Jim Duggan in his matches against Randy Savage and appearing on the Brother Love Show during house shows with Sherri Martel in November and December 1989.\n\n====1990\u20131992====\nAfter Savage and Sherri began a heated feud with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|\"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Juanita Wright|Sapphire]] near the end of 1989, Miss Elizabeth joined forces with Rhodes and Sapphire at [[WrestleMania VI]], where the two couples were engaged in the WWF's first mixed tag-team match. When Sherri attempted to help Savage double-team Rhodes, Miss Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair. While the two women faced off, Sapphire took advantage of the situation, kneeling down behind Sherri just as Miss Elizabeth pushed her. Sherri lost her balance and gave Sapphire enough advantage to pin Sherri for the win.<ref>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|author=Shields, Brian and Kevin Sullivan|publisher=DK/BradyGAMES|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/265 265]|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/265}}</ref>  Elizabeth continued to appear on the house show circuit with Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire from May 1990 through August 1990 in mixed tag team matches against Randy Savage and Sherri Martel.  From June through August 1990, Randy and Sherri had Brother Love in their corner to counter-act Elizabeth.\n\nMiss Elizabeth disappeared from WWF television until March 24, 1991 [[WrestleMania VII]], when Savage lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]] to [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. Upon his loss, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth, who was sitting at ringside, entered the ring and defended Savage. Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair and threw her out of the ring, reuniting Savage and Elizabeth.<ref name=\"wwebio\"/> Macho Man punctuated the reunion by holding down the ropes for Elizabeth after years of her doing it for him.\n\nOn June 17, 1991 during the taping of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' in an in-ring segment with [[Gene Okerlund]] announcing, [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] proposed to Miss Elizabeth, which she accepted. The couple then held a heavily promoted on-air wedding billed as \"The Match Made in Heaven\" on August 26, 1991 at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam 1991]] (the couple were officially married on December 30, 1984).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=WrestleView |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/info/diduknow.shtml |title=Did You Know?!? |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329115919/http://www.wrestleview.com/info/diduknow.shtml |archivedate=March 29, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the wedding reception, Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live [[snake]], which frightened her; newly-turned-heel [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] and [[The Undertaker]] crashed the reception and attacked Savage. This started a feud between Roberts and Savage, where Elizabeth quickly figured prominently. The first high-profile Savage-Roberts match was on December 3, 1991 at the [[This Tuesday in Texas|Tuesday in Texas]] pay-per-view event, where, after Savage gained a pinfall victory, Roberts beat down Savage, then forced Elizabeth to beg him to stop the beating. Apparently dissatisfied with her begging, Roberts grabbed her by the hair and slapped her across her face. On the February 8, 1992 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]'', Roberts, with a steel chair in tow, was waiting in the backstage area for Elizabeth and Savage to come through the curtain after a match. Roberts was about to strike Elizabeth with the chair, but Undertaker stopped him. This started Undertaker's feud with his former ally.\n\nIn her final WWF angle, WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Ric Flair]] bragged that he dated Elizabeth before Savage met her. Flair's [[tagline]] was, \"She was mine before she was yours.\" He showed photos of himself with Elizabeth in casual situations, which were later printed in an issue of ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]''. It was later revealed that the photos were in fact pictures of Savage and Elizabeth, which Flair had doctored.  Flair, with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] as his \"executive consultant\", said that they were going to show a nude photo of Elizabeth on the screen at [[WrestleMania VIII]], although this did not occur. Nonetheless, Flair's claims set up his WrestleMania VIII match with Savage. During the match on April 5, 1992, Elizabeth made her way to ringside, against the wishes of WWF officials. After Savage pinned Flair to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, an angry Flair cornered Elizabeth and began to kiss her; Elizabeth slapped Flair away, and Savage began beating Flair until ring officials broke the two up. Elizabeth's final WWF appearance took place at [[UK Rampage (1992)|UK Rampage]] on April 19, 1992 during an overseas tour of England; in that match, Savage pinned [[Shawn Michaels]] after Elizabeth, who had earlier been sent backstage, returned to prevent Sherri's interference on Michaels' behalf. Until the Savage-Michaels match from England was aired on ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling]]'' in June; the publication of the actual Savage-Elizabeth photos in ''WWF Magazine'' came at about that same time.\n\nIn August 1992, she and Savage divorced. After the decree was finalized late that summer, Savage issued a statement that was printed in ''WWF Magazine'' revealing that he and Elizabeth were no longer together, and thanking the fans for their support through the years. The publication of Savage's statement marked, at the time, a rare acknowledgement of the wrestlers' private lives for both the WWF and its flagship publication. Savage continued with the WWF for two more years, and except for the statement in ''WWF Magazine'', his divorce from Elizabeth was neither referred to nor figured into any of Savage's future feuds.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling===\n\n====1996\u20131998====\n[[File:Miss Elizabeth Nitro 1998.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Miss Elizabeth in 1998 after a taping of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''.]]\nOn January 23, 1996, Miss Elizabeth returned to wrestling as manager for Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan at Clash of the Champions XXXII. Only 3 weeks later, on February 11, 1996 Elizabeth turned on Randy Savage by helping [[Ric Flair]] defeat him at [[SuperBrawl VI]] and then became Flair's co-manager in the [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] along with [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]].\n\nIn September 1996 Elizabeth joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) alongside Hulk Hogan, but seemed to still care deeply for her ex-husband, and eventually joined his side when he too joined the nWo in February 1997. During much of 1997, Randy Savage and Elizabeth feuded with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Kimberly Page]]. In June 1998, she parted ways with Savage once again by joining Black and White nWo: nWo Hollywood. Then, she accompanied [[Eric Bischoff]] on his way to the ring for the next few months, and derided Savage. Savage coldly reminded her that he \"got over her a long time ago\" and didn't need her.\n\n====1999====\nOn the January 4 episode of ''Nitro'', Elizabeth was seen talking to police detectives. According to the storyline, she claimed that [[Bill Goldberg]] was [[stalking]] her and that he even accosted her by the water cooler. She then filed charges against Goldberg. Goldberg was arrested later that night for aggravated stalking and taken into custody by police. However, later that night, Elizabeth admitted that she was lying. As it turned out, Elizabeth was a pawn for the nWo so that Goldberg would be unable to have his scheduled title match with [[Kevin Nash]] later that night. Due to Goldberg's apparent absence, the returning Hulk Hogan [[Fingerpoke of Doom|took Goldberg's title shot in the match]].\n\nSoon after, Elizabeth accompanied [[Lex Luger]]. Lex Luger, who was accompanied by Elizabeth at this time to ringside for single matches, was supposed to get ready for the tag team match against [[Konnan]] and [[Rey Mysterio Jr.]] with Miss Elizabeth's hair on the line and Rey Mysterio Jr.'s mask on the line at [[SuperBrawl IX]] with Kevin Nash as his tag team partner. However, on the February 18, 1999 edition of ''[[WCW Thunder]]'', at the [[Maverik Center|E-Center]] in Salt Lake City, Utah, a [[limousine|limo]] pulled up and was driving along with Rey Mysterio Jr. with Lex Luger and Elizabeth inside. As Elizabeth and Lex Luger were getting out of the limo, Rey Mysterio Jr. grabbed the door and slammed it into Lex Luger's [[biceps]], injuring him in the process. Lex Luger was immediately replaced by [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] as Kevin Nash's tag team partner for the tag team match at [[Superbrawl IX]].\n\nShe then took time off from the road to be with Lex Luger during his recovery from a biceps injury.\n\nAfter Lex Luger recovered from his biceps injury, Elizabeth would make her return to WCW programming on the September 27, 1999 edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''. Towards the end of 1999, Elizabeth became much more physically involved in the action than she had ever been. Her new vicious side would be ever so apparent at [[Starrcade 1999]] when she struck [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] with his own baseball bat.\n\n====2000====\nIn February, Elizabeth managed the short-lived partnership between Lex Luger and Ric Flair. The three of them were known as Team Package. Shortly thereafter, Team Package went their separate ways as they fought various members of [[The New Blood]].\n\nElizabeth engaged in short-lived feuds with [[Vince Russo]] and [[Kimberly Page]]. On May 8, 2000, Elizabeth wrestled in her first official match against [[Daffney]]. Elizabeth worked with Kimberly Page for the remainder of May 2000.\n\nElizabeth's final WCW appearance was on the May 29, 2000 edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' and Elizabeth quietly left [[World Championship Wrestling]] on August 17, 2000 when her contract expired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Elizabeth/00Update.htm|title=Miss Elizabeth 2000 Updates|publisher=Official Women Of Wrestling|accessdate=November 4, 2007|date=August 17, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nElizabeth briefly married Cary Lubetsky, a [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]] attorney, on December 6, 1997. The wedding was held at the Cuban Hebrew Temple in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]].

The city is also used as a departure point to [[Cebu City]] as well. It has a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} coastline, of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by the island of Refugio, also known as Sipaway. Due to these aspects, the [[Philippine Ports Authority]] has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two [[RORO|RO-RO vessels]] and the extension of the length of the port to {{convert|242.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Carlos City has two pronounced seasons, wet and dry. The rainy season is from May to January with heavy rains occurring during the months of August and September. Dry season lasts from February to April. December and January are the coldest months while April is the hottest.\n\n===Barangays===\nSan Carlos City is politically subdivided into 18 [[barangays]].\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*Bagonbon\n*Buluangan\n*Codcod\n*Ermita (Sipaway)\n*Guadalupe\n*Nataban\n*Palampas\n*Barangay I ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay II ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay III ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay IV ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay V ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay VI ([[Poblacion]])\n*Prosperidad\n*Punao\n*Quezon\n*Rizal\n*San Juan (Sipaway)\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Spanish and Spanish colonization===\nSan Carlos City was formerly named \"Nabingkalan\", deriving its name from ''Nabingka'', a beautiful daughter of a chieftain of the [[Aeta|Negrito]] settlement in the area, who ruled the [[barrio]] during the early part in the 17th century. She was famous for her loveliness and mental and physical prowess. After her death, the people mourned for two years, and to perpetuate her memory, named the barrio Nabingkalan. The settlement was later bought by Carlos Apurado from [[Badian, Cebu|Badian]], [[Cebu]], who, with the help of fellow pioneers, developed the settlement into a thriving [[Christians|Christian]] village. Fragments of written history show that in 1856, the Island of Buglas ([[Negros Island|Negros]]), as a politico-military province under [[Spain]], was divided into two provinces, West Negros under [[Iloilo]] and East Negros under [[Cebu]]. The barrio of Nabingkalan under Calatrava, was under the jurisdiction of Iloilo. Se\u00f1or Don Emilio Saravia, the first political-military governor in the island during the Spanish era, renamed the place and established it as a ''pueblo''.\n\nWhen this mission was created in 1895, it belonged to the municipality of Calatraba, although it is true, that since 1891 a Religious was destined for it.The state of those years gives us the very small number of inhabitants that comprised it, which is that of 1,100 souls, who rather inhabited the mountainous p art than that of the p lay a, where the current village is. Fr. Pedro Chivite was assigned to the service of that mission. Vacant this mission during the Revolution, for the year 1904 Father Eusebio Valderrama took care of it. This with the help of the PP. \u00c1ngel Quintana, Juan Lorenzo and Vicente V\u00e1zquez attended to all the towns of that coast, from Guinjulngan to Escalante. Since that date, it is still administered by our Fathers. But in what was a bad, poor and depopulated village in 97, today it is one of the most important towns in the rich Province of Negros Occidental. of San Carlos today amounts, according to approximate calculation, to 30,000 souls. That extensive plot of land previously uncultivated today is painstakingly worked. A Spaniard who observed the fertility of that land began by raising a small sugarcane farm; and seeing the good results obtained, others were added, those fields were cultivated, modern machines were installed and, thus, what was once a wasteland, today is one of the most productive villages in Negros. In 1889 there were only four estates, in 1897 they amounted to 16 and today they are some more, property in their majority of Spanish art.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sinopsis Historica dela Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino delas Islas Filipinas dela Orden De Agustinos Descalzos por el Padre Licinio Ruiz de Sta.

In 1903, the political arena was a hot place, it being the first taste of the Filipinos to elect their own leaders. In 1912, when a sugar central was constructed, the economic life of the people was greatly enhanced. The political activities, however, was closely woven with that of Calatrava, until 1925, when Calatrava was organized into a municipality.\n\nSan Carlos Milling Company of San Carlos, Negros, have erected the first and only modern sugar mills in the Philippines, and they have gone into cane cultivation and sugar manufacture in a scientific way. The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons of cane per day, which means about 125 tons of centrifugal sugar. It was completed at the end of 1913 at a cost of about one million dollars, and the first cane ground was from the 1914 crop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Something about sugar, its history, growth, manufacture and distribution |last=George|first=Rolph|date=1917|ol = 7141860M}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, Municipality of San Carlos comprised barrios Antabayan, Cubay, Euzcasa, Looc, Malalamban, San Juan, Santa Filomena, Sitio Banatic, Tigbon, Varconia.<ref name=\"University of Michigan\">{{cite web |last1=Villamor |first1=Ignacio |last2=Buencamino |first2=Felipe |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/ajb5835.appe.001.umich.edu/page/410 |website=archive.org/ |publisher=Manila, : Bureau of Printing |accessdate=8 March 2019 |ref=University of Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe municipality of San Carlos shall consist of its present territory and that of the municipality of Calatrava, with the seat of the municipal government at the present municipality of San Carlos (Act No. 716, Enacted, April 2, 1903<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsphilippinec01unkngoog#page/n524|title=Acts of the Philippine Commission.

After the [[armistice]] in 1917, the planters who produced more sugar had their wealth greatly increased because of the new price of sugar never before enjoyed by the planters. During [[World War I]], many sons of San Carlos volunteered to fight for the [[United States]], but a few months later, were sent back home because of the armistice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n===World War II===\nSan Carlos was actively involved on the war efforts against Imperial Japan during The Second World War (World War II).  A month after the surrender of Negros to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial Forces]], the Guerrilla Movement began in San Carlos and Calatrava. As early as June 15, 1942, Guerilla Units under the leadership of Capt. Eugenio Antonio,Jr., Lt. Leonardo Marane and Lt. Alfredo Valdivia assisted by the Philippine Commonwealth Military Troops began operations against the enemy. Pitched battles were fought within the environs of the \"poblacion\". Despite the presence of the U.S. forces under Maj. Edward McClenahan, separate Guerrilla Units were scattered in the area under different Commanders as they were not able to establish a formal chain-of-command among the different Guerilla Factions effectively.\n\nUpon the return of some local [[USAFFE]] officers to San Carlos, the guerrilla movement was formally organized into fighting units under USAFFE Capts. Catalino D. Rivera, Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Loreto Y. Apuhin, together with Lts. Florencio C. Yap and Andres L. Arrogante, the bands of roving guerrillas in San Carlos were consolidated under one command. Young men in their early teens (just barely enough to carry rifles) joined the ranks and fought bravely face-to-face against the Japanese.\n\nIn March 1945, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] forces under the 7th, 71st and 72nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and local guerrilla units under the command of Col. [[Ernesto S. Mata]], attacked the Japanese garrison in the compound of San Carlos Milling Company and succeeded in driving away the Japanese Army, at the cost of the life of Lt. Alfredo Valdivia.\n\nIn October 10, 1945 President Sergio Osmena appointed Eugenio Antonio as Acting Mayor of San Carlos and Anacleto Facturan as Acting Vice Mayor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195/mode/2up |title=Messages of the President Sergio Osmena 1944-1946 |website=archive.org |archive-url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195 |archive-date=1944\u20131946 |url-status=}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war period===\nThe first post-war election found the town with a Liberal government.

In 1992 after successfully holding two activities with the [[Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival]] and the [[Dances of Flowers]] as highlights of the city fiesta, the idea of blending the two concepts to come up with a presentation that could be considered the city's very own started what today is one of the most popular street dancing festivals in the region, the present-day \"Pintaflores Festival\".\n\n''Pintaflores'' is coined from the words ''pintados'' (\"painted ones\"), the concept behind the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival, and ''flores'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"flowers\" that dominated the theme of the Dances of Flowers. The ''Pintaflores'' street dancing and ritual competition highlights the annual Pintaflores Festival every November 3\u20135.\n\nIt features rhythmic dances and dance dramas of life and death and the triumph of good against evil that depict the people's thanksgiving and merriment, abundant blessings and success. As part of the ''Pintados'' tradition, the faces, arms, bodies and legs of the dancers are painted with flowers to express gratitude to man and his environment.\n\nThe [[street dancing]] is culminated by a dance ritual performed at the City auditorium. Different dance steps and musical accompaniment add to the thrill of the competition. The human flower formation is another impressive part of the dance ritual which are products of the ingenuity and skill of the choreographers and dancers.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111212816/http://www.geocities.com/cstrecoletos/ Colegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos] high school students, bested seasoned contestants to land third place in the free interpretation category in the heavily competed Sinulog festival in Cebu City in January 1993. In April of the same year, the group won the championship in Panaad Sa Negros '93, to province-wide cultural festival in Negros Occidental.\n\nRepresented by Barangays II and Quezon, the Pintaflores street dancing contingent emerged first prize in Panaad Sa Negros in 1996. The same group with the participation of Barangay Ermita secured again the championship in Panaad Sa Negros 1997 and the fifth prize in Sinulog festival '98.\n\nIn [[Panaad sa Negros]] '98, the Pintaflores group composed of dancers from Barangays Punao and Palampas and the City Hospital graced the fiesta presentation as guest performers. In Panaad '99 the Pintaflores represented this time by elementary school children, once again proved its unbeatable streak by emerging champions, consequently reaping the [[Hall of Fame]] award for topping the fiesta presentation event in four consecutive years.\n\nHaving established a name in street dancing, Pintaflores danced performers in such places as [[Iloilo City]] (1996) and [[Roxas City]] (1997) as among the best of the best in the region, and in [[Canlaon City]] and [[Victorias]] in 1999 as the best in the province.\n\nPintaflores has evolved as a new breed of dancers emerged with the launching of Pintaflores Bata or Pinta Bata in 1996. A street dancing and ritual competition among elementary school children. Pinta Bata thrills one with the children's pleasing gracefulness and versatility that promises a crop of excellent dancers in the years to come.\n\nAfter five years and many awards, including the Hall of Fame awards in street dancing in the Panaad sa Negros, the word Pintaflores, like \"Daan Sa Kaunlaran\" and Homelot program, now has become another byword of the creativity of San Carlose\u00f1os.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[Cycle rickshaw#Philippines|Pedicabs]] and [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|Motorized tricycle]]s are common mode of transport. [[Bus]]es and [[jeepney]]s provide service for inter-town travel.

The city is also used as a departure point to [[Cebu City]] as well. It has a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} coastline, of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by the island of Refugio, also known as Sipaway. Due to these aspects, the [[Philippine Ports Authority]] has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two [[RORO|RO-RO vessels]] and the extension of the length of the port to {{convert|242.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Carlos City has two pronounced seasons, wet and dry. The rainy season is from May to January with heavy rains occurring during the months of August and September. Dry season lasts from February to April.

She was famous for her loveliness and mental and physical prowess. After her death, the people mourned for two years, and to perpetuate her memory, named the barrio Nabingkalan. The settlement was later bought by Carlos Apurado from [[Badian, Cebu|Badian]], [[Cebu]], who, with the help of fellow pioneers, developed the settlement into a thriving [[Christians|Christian]] village. Fragments of written history show that in 1856, the Island of Buglas ([[Negros Island|Negros]]), as a politico-military province under [[Spain]], was divided into two provinces, West Negros under [[Iloilo]] and East Negros under [[Cebu]]. The barrio of Nabingkalan under Calatrava, was under the jurisdiction of Iloilo. Se\u00f1or Don Emilio Saravia, the first political-military governor in the island during the Spanish era, renamed the place and established it as a ''pueblo''.\n\nWhen this mission was created in 1895, it belonged to the municipality of Calatraba, although it is true, that since 1891 a Religious was destined for it.The state of those years gives us the very small number of inhabitants that comprised it, which is that of 1,100 souls, who rather inhabited the mountainous p art than that of the p lay a, where the current village is. Fr. Pedro Chivite was assigned to the service of that mission. Vacant this mission during the Revolution, for the year 1904 Father Eusebio Valderrama took care of it. This with the help of the PP. \u00c1ngel Quintana, Juan Lorenzo and Vicente V\u00e1zquez attended to all the towns of that coast, from Guinjulngan to Escalante. Since that date, it is still administered by our Fathers. But in what was a bad, poor and depopulated village in 97, today it is one of the most important towns in the rich Province of Negros Occidental. of San Carlos today amounts, according to approximate calculation, to 30,000 souls. That extensive plot of land previously uncultivated today is painstakingly worked. A Spaniard who observed the fertility of that land began by raising a small sugarcane farm; and seeing the good results obtained, others were added, those fields were cultivated, modern machines were installed and, thus, what was once a wasteland, today is one of the most productive villages in Negros. In 1889 there were only four estates, in 1897 they amounted to 16 and today they are some more, property in their majority of Spanish art.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sinopsis Historica dela Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino delas Islas Filipinas dela Orden De Agustinos Descalzos por el Padre Licinio Ruiz de Sta.

In 1903, the political arena was a hot place, it being the first taste of the Filipinos to elect their own leaders. In 1912, when a sugar central was constructed, the economic life of the people was greatly enhanced. The political activities, however, was closely woven with that of Calatrava, until 1925, when Calatrava was organized into a municipality.\n\nSan Carlos Milling Company of San Carlos, Negros, have erected the first and only modern sugar mills in the Philippines, and they have gone into cane cultivation and sugar manufacture in a scientific way. The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons of cane per day, which means about 125 tons of centrifugal sugar. It was completed at the end of 1913 at a cost of about one million dollars, and the first cane ground was from the 1914 crop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Something about sugar, its history, growth, manufacture and distribution |last=George|first=Rolph|date=1917|ol = 7141860M}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, Municipality of San Carlos comprised barrios Antabayan, Cubay, Euzcasa, Looc, Malalamban, San Juan, Santa Filomena, Sitio Banatic, Tigbon, Varconia.<ref name=\"University of Michigan\">{{cite web |last1=Villamor |first1=Ignacio |last2=Buencamino |first2=Felipe |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/ajb5835.appe.001.umich.edu/page/410 |website=archive.org/ |publisher=Manila, : Bureau of Printing |accessdate=8 March 2019 |ref=University of Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe municipality of San Carlos shall consist of its present territory and that of the municipality of Calatrava, with the seat of the municipal government at the present municipality of San Carlos (Act No. 716, Enacted, April 2, 1903<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsphilippinec01unkngoog#page/n524|title=Acts of the Philippine Commission.

After the [[armistice]] in 1917, the planters who produced more sugar had their wealth greatly increased because of the new price of sugar never before enjoyed by the planters. During [[World War I]], many sons of San Carlos volunteered to fight for the [[United States]], but a few months later, were sent back home because of the armistice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n===World War II===\nSan Carlos was actively involved on the war efforts against Imperial Japan during The Second World War (World War II).  A month after the surrender of Negros to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial Forces]], the Guerrilla Movement began in San Carlos and Calatrava. As early as June 15, 1942, Guerilla Units under the leadership of Capt. Eugenio Antonio,Jr., Lt. Leonardo Marane and Lt. Alfredo Valdivia assisted by the Philippine Commonwealth Military Troops began operations against the enemy. Pitched battles were fought within the environs of the \"poblacion\". Despite the presence of the U.S. forces under Maj. Edward McClenahan, separate Guerrilla Units were scattered in the area under different Commanders as they were not able to establish a formal chain-of-command among the different Guerilla Factions effectively.\n\nUpon the return of some local [[USAFFE]] officers to San Carlos, the guerrilla movement was formally organized into fighting units under USAFFE Capts. Catalino D. Rivera, Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Loreto Y. Apuhin, together with Lts. Florencio C. Yap and Andres L. Arrogante, the bands of roving guerrillas in San Carlos were consolidated under one command. Young men in their early teens (just barely enough to carry rifles) joined the ranks and fought bravely face-to-face against the Japanese.\n\nIn March 1945, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] forces under the 7th, 71st and 72nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and local guerrilla units under the command of Col. [[Ernesto S. Mata]], attacked the Japanese garrison in the compound of San Carlos Milling Company and succeeded in driving away the Japanese Army, at the cost of the life of Lt. Alfredo Valdivia.\n\nIn October 10, 1945 President Sergio Osmena appointed Eugenio Antonio as Acting Mayor of San Carlos and Anacleto Facturan as Acting Vice Mayor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195/mode/2up |title=Messages of the President Sergio Osmena 1944-1946 |website=archive.org |archive-url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195 |archive-date=1944\u20131946 |url-status=}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war period===\nThe first post-war election found the town with a Liberal government.

In 1992 after successfully holding two activities with the [[Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival]] and the [[Dances of Flowers]] as highlights of the city fiesta, the idea of blending the two concepts to come up with a presentation that could be considered the city's very own started what today is one of the most popular street dancing festivals in the region, the present-day \"Pintaflores Festival\".\n\n''Pintaflores'' is coined from the words ''pintados'' (\"painted ones\"), the concept behind the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival, and ''flores'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"flowers\" that dominated the theme of the Dances of Flowers. The ''Pintaflores'' street dancing and ritual competition highlights the annual Pintaflores Festival every November 3\u20135.\n\nIt features rhythmic dances and dance dramas of life and death and the triumph of good against evil that depict the people's thanksgiving and merriment, abundant blessings and success. As part of the ''Pintados'' tradition, the faces, arms, bodies and legs of the dancers are painted with flowers to express gratitude to man and his environment.\n\nThe [[street dancing]] is culminated by a dance ritual performed at the City auditorium. Different dance steps and musical accompaniment add to the thrill of the competition. The human flower formation is another impressive part of the dance ritual which are products of the ingenuity and skill of the choreographers and dancers.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111212816/http://www.geocities.com/cstrecoletos/ Colegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos] high school students, bested seasoned contestants to land third place in the free interpretation category in the heavily competed Sinulog festival in Cebu City in January 1993. In April of the same year, the group won the championship in Panaad Sa Negros '93, to province-wide cultural festival in Negros Occidental.\n\nRepresented by Barangays II and Quezon, the Pintaflores street dancing contingent emerged first prize in Panaad Sa Negros in 1996. The same group with the participation of Barangay Ermita secured again the championship in Panaad Sa Negros 1997 and the fifth prize in Sinulog festival '98.\n\nIn [[Panaad sa Negros]] '98, the Pintaflores group composed of dancers from Barangays Punao and Palampas and the City Hospital graced the fiesta presentation as guest performers. In Panaad '99 the Pintaflores represented this time by elementary school children, once again proved its unbeatable streak by emerging champions, consequently reaping the [[Hall of Fame]] award for topping the fiesta presentation event in four consecutive years.\n\nHaving established a name in street dancing, Pintaflores danced performers in such places as [[Iloilo City]] (1996) and [[Roxas City]] (1997) as among the best of the best in the region, and in [[Canlaon City]] and [[Victorias]] in 1999 as the best in the province.\n\nPintaflores has evolved as a new breed of dancers emerged with the launching of Pintaflores Bata or Pinta Bata in 1996. A street dancing and ritual competition among elementary school children. Pinta Bata thrills one with the children's pleasing gracefulness and versatility that promises a crop of excellent dancers in the years to come.\n\nAfter five years and many awards, including the Hall of Fame awards in street dancing in the Panaad sa Negros, the word Pintaflores, like \"Daan Sa Kaunlaran\" and Homelot program, now has become another byword of the creativity of San Carlose\u00f1os.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[Cycle rickshaw#Philippines|Pedicabs]] and [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|Motorized tricycle]]s are common mode of transport.

It is bounded in the north by Asuncion Pass and the [[Visayan Sea]]; the City of Talisay and Municipality of Calatrava in the south; cities of [[Cadiz, Negros Occidental|Cadiz]] and [[Silay]] in the west and the City of [[Escalante, Negros Occidental|Escalante]] and Municipality of [[Toboso, Negros Occidental|Toboso]] in the east.\n\nThe name of the city comes from the semi-spherical shell called \"sigay\", which can be found in the area.\n\n==Barangays==\nSagay City is politically subdivided into 25 [[Barangays|Barangay]].\n\n* '''Andres Bonifacio''':\nAndres Bonifacio became a barrio in the late 60s; once called Sitio Maasin. It was the largest sitio of Barrio Vito and contributed a huge income because of its lime quarries and vast land area. The separation of Andres Bonifacio from Vito was materialized through land donation of the barrio and school sites by the family of the late Carlos and Elea Canoy-Esperancilla. It was Mrs. Elea Canoy Esperancilla who suggested to name the new barrio Andres Bonifacio to give honor to the great Filipino hero. Today, Andres Bonifacio is a fast moving barangay when it comes to development and progress. It is also noted for its natural and man-made caves\n* '''Bato''':\nSometime in 1929, Bato, then a forestall land with few inhabitants was a place of gathering of people living in the hinterlands. There used to be a place called \u201ctabu\u201d, where people from the hinterlands meet for recreation like cockfighting (\u201ctari\u201d) or horse fighting in a clearing area near the Himoga-an River where a big rock (\u201cbato\u201d) was a landmark. The place was also used by the people during \u201ctabu\u201d, a day set by them for marketing or bartering their products. For the few residents of the place, this clearing also served as a place of recreation. For people who visited the place for recreation or for economic reasons, they named the place Bato because of the big rock.\n* '''Baviera''':\nThe place Baviera was once covered with thick forest where wild pigs and other wild animals abound in this area. It is located in the southwestern part at the foot of Shermanhill. Before the Second World War, tall big trees were cut down by workers of the Insular Lumber Co. for it was under the concession with the Philippine Government. After leaving the area, sometime in 1932, a businessman by the name of FaustoBaviera cleared the area by making kaingins and planted the place with root crops, rice, cassava and others. Being a businessman he likewise gathered products like rattan, hagnaya and balao and sold these products in BrgyParaiso, a progressive barangay of Sagay.\n* '''Bulanon''':\nDuring the pre-Spanish time, unnamed village was inhabited by various non-Christian tribes who were independent of and hostile towards each other. The known history of Barangay Bulanon started sometime in the year 1880 when the Spanish conquestadores first founded a settlement of non-Christian Filipinos near the twin big rivers. The village was originally named Arguelles after father Arguelles, the founder of the said settlement. The place later became the first pueblo.\n* '''Campo Himoga-an''':\nBarangay Cpo. Himoga-an got its name from the visayan word \u201ccampo\u201d which means \u201cCamp\u201d of the Insular Lumber Co. (ILCO) personnel, where housing, a canteen, bodega and locomotive water tank were constructed while Himoga-an was taken from the name of the river traversing the place was located. Literally, Cpo. Himoga-an is a camp of laborer residents. In 1935, after the camp was completed, a civic- minded citizen named Simeon Templado, convinced all parents in the camp to have a school for their children, and a school building was constructed by way of self-help cooperation. Later, they organized the Parent-Teacher Association in which Mr. Templado became president. With his leadership, the PTA passed a resolution requesting the local government of Sagay to release a donation of four (4) hectares of land for the school site and public plaza. The resolution was indorsed by the local government of Sagay to the Bureau of Land which later approved the proposal and survey was then conducted. Upon completion of the survey, another PTA resolution was passed requesting for the declaration of Cpo. Himoga-an as one of the barrios of Sagay. After several months, the Municipality of Sagay approved the proposal and declared Cpo. Himoga-an as a new barrio of Sagay.\n* '''Colonia Divina''':\nIn the year 1957, Rt. Rv. Dr. Roberto G. Mahilum, who was called Master and Father and Founder of a Trinitian Religious Organization, legally known as the ALAPH DIVINE TEMPLE, duly established and organized in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, teaching the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, ventured himself together with a group of his adherents and settled in the vicinity of Barangay Cpo. Santiago which they called Colonia Divina. On May 2, 1963 through Mun. Res. #59 of the Municipal Council of Sagay, petitioned the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental to declare Colonia Divina as Chartered Barrio. Then, on July 19, 1963 Colonia Divina became a Chartered Barrio as per Resolution #614 of the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental.\n* '''[[Fabrica]]''':\nThe name FABRICA refers to lumber factory or sawmill. It was told, that when a group of visiting Americans/ Europeans asked about the place the local residents just answered \u201cPabrica\u201d referring to the mill itself (not knowing exactly what was being asked). However, with their American accent instead of Pabrica they pronounced it \u201cFABRICA\u201d since then the place bears that name.\n* '''General Luna''':\nThe recorded history of Barangay General Luna started in 1929, when the Insular Lumber Company began its logging operation in the area. The inhabitants followed to clear the area and began cultivating the land with rice and corn. The families with big clearings are the Duncaras and the Piccios. They donated portion of their cleared land to the government for the barrio and the school site, Later they named the new barangay after General Luna, one of our great Filipino heroes.\n* '''Himoga-an Baybay'''\n* '''Lopez Jaena''':\nBarangay Lopez Jaena is located in the eastern part of the City of Sagay, Negros Occidental. The history of the barangay dates back in 1902, which started as a very small settlement. Missionaries from foreign lands came and found out that this place was scarcely populated. The place was covered with big trees or forest. Among the first residents was Pedro Paculba and was considered as the most respected person in this place. He named this place \u201cLopez Jaena\u201d in honor of Graciano Lopez Jaena, an Ilonggo hero who was recognized for his great contribution to the history of our country. The Missionaries brought about changes especially in the educational and religious aspect in the life of the people. At that time the head of the people was called \u201c Cabeza del Barrio \u201c. Education had given them opportunities in finding means to improve their ways of living. School was established and the first teachers were mostly Missionaries. All of the leaders have contributed their part in transforming this place into a big settlement. There was intermingling of dialects. Many have established permanent dwellings in this place. This barangay was also awarded the cleanest barrio in Sagay, under the leadership of the late Mr. Felix Rodillado, who at that time was the Barrio Lieutenant or Teniente del Barrio.\n* '''Malubon''':\nThe term \u201cMalubon\u201d is an ethnic Negrito term which connotes a white plain area suited to rice farming. As part and parcel of the lumber concession of the defunct Insular Lumber Company (ILCO), Malubon was a heavily forested area. After the rapid cutting of the forest trees, ILCO moved to the upland areas which are still forested leaving Malubon as agricultural area which has become very attractive for settlers and homesteaders. Sometime in the years 1939\u201340, Malubon was officially organized as a distinct barrio separated from Fabrica. School was opened to accommodate the educational needs of its children.\n* '''Maquiling''':\nMany years ago, there was a small settlement located in the rolling hills of the Municipality of Sagay. The place was covered with thick vegetation and trees and people come to visit the place and later decided to dwell. These people who first migrated called the place SAPLAD. Later on, through the efforts of a civic-spirited group, a school was built which encouraged more people to settle and owned lands. One of the first settlers was Crispin Maquiling, member of the Philippine Constabulary and who later became the barrio lieutenant. His leadership was looked upon by the people, being their good leader that they decided to name the place Maquiling in his honor. Today, the place continues to flourish as Sagay progresses to become a fully developed city in Negros Occidental.\n* '''Molocaboc''':\nSometime in the year 1880, the first known settlers in the island were the Abong brothers led by Eusebio Abong popularly known as Kapitan Sebio. They were grown fishermen from Sicogon Island, Carles Iloilo. At that time, the whole island had no name to call on. Kapitan Sebio together with his brothers Francisco and Atong cleared the island and utilized the area as pasture of their herbs. They divided area among themselves the island for them to settle and the most frequent place for gathering is the place of Atong which they called it Cangatong, a Cebuano word which means \u201cit's Atong's place.\u201d Cangatong is a place where a big Mocaboc tree grows that most transient fishermen usually took their siesta time. The said Mocaboc tree is a kind of mangrove that was very famous at that time as medicinal tree. Then, it was Francisco who suggested to name the island Mocaboc after the tree considering the abundance of the species in the island. However, the Spanish authorities cannot\npronounce Mocaboc properly so they inserted the syllable \u201clo\u201d making it Molocaboc. From that time on, the place bore the name Molocaboc and is now noted for various species of mangroves lining its coast and of bubble shell deposit\n* '''Old Sagay''':\nThe recorded history of Sagay dates back to the 1860 era when Teniente Francisco Rodriguez and Basilio Cordova founded a small settlement in the mouth of a river known as BulanonRiver. The settlement was then called Arguelles. In due time the settlement prospered and became the town proper. Arguelles was the center of commerce and trade in the area for about ten years from the time of its founding. In 1870, the Spanish Governor ordered the transfer of the town site to a bigger and more progressive community, also near the sea. The place was christened \u201cPueblo de Magallanes, the present site of Barangay Old Sagay. After World War II, the seat of government was transferred to the present Poblacion site, Dalusan but the barangay retained its name as Sagay with the prefix old referring to the old settlement in the coastal area\n* Paraiso\n* Plaridel\n* Poblacion I (Barangay 1)\n* Poblacion II (Barangay 2)\n* Puey\n* Rafaela Barrera\n* Rizal\n* Sewahon I (Campo Santiago)\n* Taba-ao\n* Tadlong\n* Vito\n\n==History==\n\n===Sagay Under Spain===\n\nSagay City was originally called Arguelles Nicolai when Teniente Francisco Rodriguez and Basilio Cordova founded it in 1860 in the mouth of the Bulanon River.  Later, by the order of the Spanish governor the town was transferred to Pueblo de Magallanes (now known as Old Sagay) in honor of Fernando Magallanes.\n\nHaving the status of a pueblo, Sagay was entitled to have a \"Capitan del Pueblo,\" the highest town official during the time. The first to be appointed to this position by the Spanish Governor was Elulalio Rodriguez. Gregorio Parre\u00f1o, and Peter Parker later succeeded him.\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], Sagay contributed its share to what proved to be a successful national struggle for independence. The hard-won [[First Philippine Republic]] was however short-lived when the country passed to the hands of another colonial power, the United States of America in 1898.\n\n===The American period===\n\nIn 1906, during the administration of the second President Benjie Adolfo, the name of the town was officially changed to Sagay. The name was taken from the semi-spherical shell called \"sigay\", which can be found in the area. The American influence seeped into every aspect of Sagay's life, politically and culturally. At this period of Sagay's history, land transportation began to supplant sea travel, but the seaside community continued to flourish. The first public schools conducted in English were established. Mr. Cornelio Pascual, Sr. was the first English Teacher assigned in Vito. American missionaries were sent to tutor more Filipino English teachers.\n\nMeanwhile, sometime in 1907, the Insular Lumber Company, reputed to be the biggest hardwood lumber mill in the world, was established in what is now called Barangay Fabrica. Though measures to prevent the destruction of Sagay's rich forest were made, reforestation programs failed. Later, the old forest areas were converted mostly into sugarcane fields and some into cornfields. With the exhaustion of the forest resources of Sagay, the ILCO \u2013 Philippines was phased out in 1975 and later transferred to Hinoba-an.\n\nA major industrial development gave Sagay another big step forward: the establishment of Lopez Sugar Corporation in the 1920s. Also during these years, sugar, copra, lumber and fishing became the important source of income for the inhabitants. The economic growth of Sagay brought about influx of migrants from [[Iloilo]], [[Guimaras]], [[Cebu]] and [[Bohol]]. This trend made Sagay a melting pot of ethnically-different but equally-hardworking Cebuanos and Ilonggos. With these developments, business and industry flourished. Leading both sectors were big businessmen and industrialists like the Lopezes, the Cuaycongs, the Jisons, the Gamboas, and the Vasquezes. The sugar boom brought the \"old families\" into the industry like the Pueys, the Nichols, the Katalbases, and the Tupases, which branched out to the Mara\u00f1ons, the de la Pazes, the Ibrados and the Libo-ons.\n\n===World War II===\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, two Civil Governments existed in Sagay. Under the Japanese national government of Jose Laurel, Sr., Vicente Katalbas was appointed mayor, while the resistance government of the province, headed by Alfredo Montelibano, Sr. as governor, appointed Tomas Londres as Mayor whose seat of government was in the mountain areas of Sitio Balibag, Lopez Jaena. Their term however, abruptly ended when the combined Filipino and American forces liberated the province from the Japanese at the early part of 1945. When Sergio Osme\u00f1a, Sr., as vice-president to Manuel L. Quezon who died during the war, took over the helm of the national government, Teodoro Lopez, Sr. was appointed Mayor of Sagay. During his short term, Teodoro Lopez, Sr. concentrated in rebuilding the administrative machinery of the local government.\n\nSeveral hundreds of thousands of Filipino soldiers and officers of the 7th, 72nd and 75th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated and re-occupied the town of Sagay by attacking and driving off Japanese troops in 1945.\n\nThe factories were destroyed and the economy was in shambles. A Eusebio Lopez Memorial School Building in Barangay Paraiso served as the incarceration area for captured Filipino soldiers and American pilots and soldiers. It also served as the headquarters of Fourth Flight Division of the Japanese Imperial Air Force whose airfield was located in Pula-Bunglas area in Barangay Malubon.  During the last days of the war, the Fourth Flight Division of the Japanese Imperial Airforce organized kamikaze or suicide units to be stationed here and in Bacolod. Known later as the Third Regiment Suicide Corps, it was headed by Major Tsuneharu Sirai with Capt. Tetsuzu Kimura as his Chief Staff Officer. Of its 59 pilots and crews, 30 were killed in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] which they played a major role as kamikaze pilots. The Pula \u2013 Bunglas area of Barangay Malubon served as the Japanese landing field for the Fourth Flight Division. It was also a site where the local soldiers, guerrillas and civilians, after Japanese spies identified them as guerrilla members or collaborators, were forced to dig holes and consequently executed and buried. Old residents believe that almost 1,542 people were buried here.\n\nBarrio 3 Wharf, Fabrica served as the transport point of processed lumber destined to Japan from Insular Lumber Company and also a docking area of Japanese supply ship during the war-torn years. The Iglanggam Bridge at Barangay Tadlong served as the dumping site of executed local soldiers, guerrillas and civilians.  This is also known as the site where confiscated money, especially silver Peso coins encased in concrete blocks, were dumped by the retreating Japanese soldiers.\n\nBalibag Hill, Lopez Jaena was the place where the set of resistance government of Free Sagay under Mayor Tomas Londres (appointed by Island Governor Alfredo Montelibano, Sr.) was established. It was also known as tabo-an or market place during the war and in 1944, a group of Japanese soldiers killed about 27 homeguards or \"toltog\" guerrillas. After the mass killing, the Japanese soldiers set the whole area on fire, burning the shanties and the dead. The Japanese \"puppet\" government under Vicente Lacson Katalbas was established at the Big House, Central Lopez, Paraiso. A Japanese barracks and checkpoint was established. A Japanese anti-aircraft still can be found inside the ground of the house.\n\nAt Barangay Poblacion II, Japanese zero fighters left bullet holes when they intended to destroy the water supply of the people during the last days of the war. Holes from 60mm machine-guns left an indelible mark on the water tank.\n\nA training site of USAFFE (United States Army Forces in the Far East), under the supervision of Lt. Dominador Gaerland, was established at Tangnonon, Barangay Fabrica at the ancestral home of Lopez Kabayao.\n\nOn July 26, 1942, [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the United States of America ordered a national mobilization in the Philippines and on August 23, 1942, the first group of reservist in Negros were called on duty by virtue of Philippine Army HQ order of August 4 and they were trained here. The first group reported in the said mobilization camp constituted the 71st Infantry Regiment.\n\n===Post war period===\nThe first election held right after the Second World War made Jose B. Puey, Sr. and Amalio Cueva, Sr. Mayor and Vice Mayor respectively. However, shortly after, Mayor Jose B. Puey, Sr. was appointed member of the Provincial Board of [[Negros Occidental]] thus Vice Mayor Amalio Cueva, Sr. took over the Municipal leadership and through his initiative, the seat of government was transferred to its present site, Dalusan. Incidentally, the transfer signaled the diminishing importance of sea travel and the takeover of overland transportation as the conveyor of progress and development. Old Sagay (the previous seat of government) is an old coastal center of population while Dalusan is a late highway occurrence. The transfer was made possible partly through land donations for the town site by Do\u00f1a Rosario Cooper and the heirs of the late Clayton Nichols. Schools, markets and commercial establishments were soon established. Jose B. Puey, Sr. remained Provincial Board Member until his election as congressman for the first District of Negros Occidental in 1953.\n\nIn the late 1950s, two Sagaynon politicians were in the forefront of Negros politics, Jose B. Puey, Sr. (Congressman from 1953 to 1957) and Alfredo E. Mara\u00f1on, Sr. (Board Member from 1956 to 1959). This meant that provincial and national aid were extended to Sagay. More roads and school buildings were constructed, thousands of hectares of logged off area of the Insular Lumber Company were planted with coconut trees and sugarcane. Sherman Hill, near Barangay Bato was discovered to contain rich deposits of the highest silica. The growing markets for sea products brought about unprecedented boom in the fishing industry for which the coastal waters of Sagay proved to equal the demand. The municipal population rose to more than 60,000 and the revenue increased.  After Mayor Amalio Cueva, came Tereso Canoy, Bruno Cueva, Sr. and Quintin Katalbas.\n\nIn 1963, Jose H. Puey, Jr. was elected mayor of Sagay. The income continued to rise. More schools were built and more roads, linking the barangays to the town capital, were constructed. The inefficient electrical system was updated, fire fighting equipment and the police units were modernized. It was during this time that Alfredo Mara\u00f1on Sr. began entertaining the idea of putting up another sugar mill in Sagay which farmers can partly own. He campaigned for support, but there was too much opposition even from some of his close friends. Nevertheless, his idea became a reality when in 1967, shortly after his death, Sagay Central Inc. was born. Mr. Mara\u00f1on's dream was made real through the help of [[Ferdinand Marcos|President Ferdinand E. Marcos]] and the then Philippine National Bank President Roberto S. Benedicto who both shared his vision for Sagay. With the new sugar mill at Barangay Bato, new areas were opened and planted with sugarcane. Today the new sugar mill factory is benefiting hundreds of small farmers.\n\nThe then Mayor, Congressman and now Governor of Negros Occidental Alfredo G. Mara\u00f1on, Jr. assumed the political leadership of Sagay in 1972. Under his administration, Sagay acquired a new town hall, a municipal gymnasium, a livestock auction market, public markets for a number of barangays and municipal wharves in barangays Vito and Old Sagay. He caused the organization of Sagay Water District in 1978. He effected the purchase of a municipal subdivision for the municipal employees in 1979. These achievements by themselves have helped make Sagay a first-class C municipality (the highest in the entire Negros). The then Mayor Alfredo G. Mara\u00f1on, Jr.'s successful negotiation of the sponsorship contract with the German District of [[Osterholz]] is his most important achievement.\n\n===Conversion into a city===\nIt had been a long time aspiration to get Sagay city status. The leadership of Mayor Joseph G. Mara\u00f1on and Vice Mayor Fortunato S. Javelosa inspired the authorship of Congressman Alfredo G. Mara\u00f1on of House Bill No. 6543, \"An Act Converting the Municipality of Sagay into a component city of Negros Occidental\" during the 10th Congress. Passing through the legislation process, a public hearing was held in Sagay City on February 22, 1996.  On May 3, 1996, Sen. Raul Roco sponsored the Senate Bill No. 1191, the Senate version of the cityhood. On June 11, 1996, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed into law RA8192, now the charter of Sagay City.  On June 10, 1996, the residents voted and ratified RA8192 and made Sagay, officially Sagay City.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Sagay\n| 1903 = 8311\n| 1918 = 17752\n| 1939 = 53767\n| 1948 = 67152\n| 1960 = 71335\n| 1970 = 79702\n| 1975 = 95421\n| 1980 = 99118\n| 1990 = 112700\n| 1995 = 128374\n| 2000 = 129765\n| 2007 = 140511\n| 2010 = 140740\n| 2015 = 146264\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nSagay City's inhabitants are known to speak a mixture of [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].\n\n==Local government==\nThe elected mayor in 2007 Elections is Alfredo Mara\u00f1on Jr. with his vice mayor elect Leo Rafael Cueva.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nSagay can be identified in the map of Negros Occidental because of its \"ice-cream cone\" shape sliced from the northern tip of [[Negros Island|Negros]].  It is bounded in the north by Asuncion Pass and the [[Visayan Sea]]; the City of Talisay and Municipality of Calatrava in the south; cities of [[Cadiz, Negros Occidental|Cadiz]] and [[Silay]] in the west and the City of [[Escalante, Negros Occidental|Escalante]] and Municipality of [[Toboso, Negros Occidental|Toboso]] in the east.\n\nThe name of the city comes from the semi-spherical shell called \"sigay\", which can be found in the area.\n\n==Barangays==\nSagay City is politically subdivided into 25 [[Barangays|Barangay]].\n\n* '''Andres Bonifacio''':\nAndres Bonifacio became a barrio in the late 60s; once called Sitio Maasin. It was the largest sitio of Barrio Vito and contributed a huge income because of its lime quarries and vast land area. The separation of Andres Bonifacio from Vito was materialized through land donation of the barrio and school sites by the family of the late Carlos and Elea Canoy-Esperancilla. It was Mrs. Elea Canoy Esperancilla who suggested to name the new barrio Andres Bonifacio to give honor to the great Filipino hero. Today, Andres Bonifacio is a fast moving barangay when it comes to development and progress. It is also noted for its natural and man-made caves\n* '''Bato''':\nSometime in 1929, Bato, then a forestall land with few inhabitants was a place of gathering of people living in the hinterlands. There used to be a place called \u201ctabu\u201d, where people from the hinterlands meet for recreation like cockfighting (\u201ctari\u201d) or horse fighting in a clearing area near the Himoga-an River where a big rock (\u201cbato\u201d) was a landmark. The place was also used by the people during \u201ctabu\u201d, a day set by them for marketing or bartering their products. For the few residents of the place, this clearing also served as a place of recreation. For people who visited the place for recreation or for economic reasons, they named the place Bato because of the big rock.\n* '''Baviera''':\nThe place Baviera was once covered with thick forest where wild pigs and other wild animals abound in this area. It is located in the southwestern part at the foot of Shermanhill. Before the Second World War, tall big trees were cut down by workers of the Insular Lumber Co. for it was under the concession with the Philippine Government. After leaving the area, sometime in 1932, a businessman by the name of FaustoBaviera cleared the area by making kaingins and planted the place with root crops, rice, cassava and others. Being a businessman he likewise gathered products like rattan, hagnaya and balao and sold these products in BrgyParaiso, a progressive barangay of Sagay.\n* '''Bulanon''':\nDuring the pre-Spanish time, unnamed village was inhabited by various non-Christian tribes who were independent of and hostile towards each other. The known history of Barangay Bulanon started sometime in the year 1880 when the Spanish conquestadores first founded a settlement of non-Christian Filipinos near the twin big rivers. The village was originally named Arguelles after father Arguelles, the founder of the said settlement. The place later became the first pueblo.\n* '''Campo Himoga-an''':\nBarangay Cpo. Himoga-an got its name from the visayan word \u201ccampo\u201d which means \u201cCamp\u201d of the Insular Lumber Co. (ILCO) personnel, where housing, a canteen, bodega and locomotive water tank were constructed while Himoga-an was taken from the name of the river traversing the place was located. Literally, Cpo. Himoga-an is a camp of laborer residents. In 1935, after the camp was completed, a civic- minded citizen named Simeon Templado, convinced all parents in the camp to have a school for their children, and a school building was constructed by way of self-help cooperation. Later, they organized the Parent-Teacher Association in which Mr. Templado became president. With his leadership, the PTA passed a resolution requesting the local government of Sagay to release a donation of four (4) hectares of land for the school site and public plaza. The resolution was indorsed by the local government of Sagay to the Bureau of Land which later approved the proposal and survey was then conducted. Upon completion of the survey, another PTA resolution was passed requesting for the declaration of Cpo. Himoga-an as one of the barrios of Sagay. After several months, the Municipality of Sagay approved the proposal and declared Cpo. Himoga-an as a new barrio of Sagay.\n* '''Colonia Divina''':\nIn the year 1957, Rt. Rv. Dr. Roberto G. Mahilum, who was called Master and Father and Founder of a Trinitian Religious Organization, legally known as the ALAPH DIVINE TEMPLE, duly established and organized in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, teaching the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, ventured himself together with a group of his adherents and settled in the vicinity of Barangay Cpo. Santiago which they called Colonia Divina. On May 2, 1963 through Mun. Res. #59 of the Municipal Council of Sagay, petitioned the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental to declare Colonia Divina as Chartered Barrio. Then, on July 19, 1963 Colonia Divina became a Chartered Barrio as per Resolution #614 of the Provincial Board of Negros Occidental.\n* '''[[Fabrica]]''':\nThe name FABRICA refers to lumber factory or sawmill. It was told, that when a group of visiting Americans/ Europeans asked about the place the local residents just answered \u201cPabrica\u201d referring to the mill itself (not knowing exactly what was being asked). However, with their American accent instead of Pabrica they pronounced it \u201cFABRICA\u201d since then the place bears that name.\n* '''General Luna''':\nThe recorded history of Barangay General Luna started in 1929, when the Insular Lumber Company began its logging operation in the area. The inhabitants followed to clear the area and began cultivating the land with rice and corn. The families with big clearings are the Duncaras and the Piccios. They donated portion of their cleared land to the government for the barrio and the school site, Later they named the new barangay after General Luna, one of our great Filipino heroes.\n* '''Himoga-an Baybay'''\n* '''Lopez Jaena''':\nBarangay Lopez Jaena is located in the eastern part of the City of Sagay, Negros Occidental. The history of the barangay dates back in 1902, which started as a very small settlement. Missionaries from foreign lands came and found out that this place was scarcely populated. The place was covered with big trees or forest. Among the first residents was Pedro Paculba and was considered as the most respected person in this place. He named this place \u201cLopez Jaena\u201d in honor of Graciano Lopez Jaena, an Ilonggo hero who was recognized for his great contribution to the history of our country. The Missionaries brought about changes especially in the educational and religious aspect in the life of the people. At that time the head of the people was called \u201c Cabeza del Barrio \u201c. Education had given them opportunities in finding means to improve their ways of living. School was established and the first teachers were mostly Missionaries. All of the leaders have contributed their part in transforming this place into a big settlement. There was intermingling of dialects. Many have established permanent dwellings in this place. This barangay was also awarded the cleanest barrio in Sagay, under the leadership of the late Mr. Felix Rodillado, who at that time was the Barrio Lieutenant or Teniente del Barrio.\n* '''Malubon''':\nThe term \u201cMalubon\u201d is an ethnic Negrito term which connotes a white plain area suited to rice farming. As part and parcel of the lumber concession of the defunct Insular Lumber Company (ILCO), Malubon was a heavily forested area. After the rapid cutting of the forest trees, ILCO moved to the upland areas which are still forested leaving Malubon as agricultural area which has become very attractive for settlers and homesteaders. Sometime in the years 1939\u201340, Malubon was officially organized as a distinct barrio separated from Fabrica. School was opened to accommodate the educational needs of its children.\n* '''Maquiling''':\nMany years ago, there was a small settlement located in the rolling hills of the Municipality of Sagay. The place was covered with thick vegetation and trees and people come to visit the place and later decided to dwell. These people who first migrated called the place SAPLAD. Later on, through the efforts of a civic-spirited group, a school was built which encouraged more people to settle and owned lands. One of the first settlers was Crispin Maquiling, member of the Philippine Constabulary and who later became the barrio lieutenant. His leadership was looked upon by the people, being their good leader that they decided to name the place Maquiling in his honor. Today, the place continues to flourish as Sagay progresses to become a fully developed city in Negros Occidental.\n* '''Molocaboc''':\nSometime in the year 1880, the first known settlers in the island were the Abong brothers led by Eusebio Abong popularly known as Kapitan Sebio. They were grown fishermen from Sicogon Island, Carles Iloilo. At that time, the whole island had no name to call on. Kapitan Sebio together with his brothers Francisco and Atong cleared the island and utilized the area as pasture of their herbs. They divided area among themselves the island for them to settle and the most frequent place for gathering is the place of Atong which they called it Cangatong, a Cebuano word which means \u201cit's Atong's place.\u201d Cangatong is a place where a big Mocaboc tree grows that most transient fishermen usually took their siesta time. The said Mocaboc tree is a kind of mangrove that was very famous at that time as medicinal tree. Then, it was Francisco who suggested to name the island Mocaboc after the tree considering the abundance of the species in the island. However, the Spanish authorities cannot\npronounce Mocaboc properly so they inserted the syllable \u201clo\u201d making it Molocaboc. From that time on, the place bore the name Molocaboc and is now noted for various species of mangroves lining its coast and of bubble shell deposit\n* '''Old Sagay''':\nThe recorded history of Sagay dates back to the 1860 era when Teniente Francisco Rodriguez and Basilio Cordova founded a small settlement in the mouth of a river known as BulanonRiver. The settlement was then called Arguelles. In due time the settlement prospered and became the town proper. Arguelles was the center of commerce and trade in the area for about ten years from the time of its founding. In 1870, the Spanish Governor ordered the transfer of the town site to a bigger and more progressive community, also near the sea. The place was christened \u201cPueblo de Magallanes, the present site of Barangay Old Sagay. After World War II, the seat of government was transferred to the present Poblacion site, Dalusan but the barangay retained its name as Sagay with the prefix old referring to the old settlement in the coastal area\n* Paraiso\n* Plaridel\n* Poblacion I (Barangay 1)\n* Poblacion II (Barangay 2)\n* Puey\n* Rafaela Barrera\n* Rizal\n* Sewahon I (Campo Santiago)\n* Taba-ao\n* Tadlong\n* Vito\n\n==History==\n\n===Sagay Under Spain===\n\nSagay City was originally called Arguelles Nicolai when Teniente Francisco Rodriguez and Basilio Cordova founded it in 1860 in the mouth of the Bulanon River.  Later, by the order of the Spanish governor the town was transferred to Pueblo de Magallanes (now known as Old Sagay) in honor of Fernando Magallanes.\n\nHaving the status of a pueblo, Sagay was entitled to have a \"Capitan del Pueblo,\" the highest town official during the time. The first to be appointed to this position by the Spanish Governor was Elulalio Rodriguez. Gregorio Parre\u00f1o, and Peter Parker later succeeded him.\n\nDuring the [[Philippine Revolution]], Sagay contributed its share to what proved to be a successful national struggle for independence. The hard-won [[First Philippine Republic]] was however short-lived when the country passed to the hands of another colonial power, the United States of America in 1898.\n\n===The American period===\n\nIn 1906, during the administration of the second President Benjie Adolfo, the name of the town was officially changed to Sagay. The name was taken from the semi-spherical shell called \"sigay\", which can be found in the area. The American influence seeped into every aspect of Sagay's life, politically and culturally. At this period of Sagay's history, land transportation began to supplant sea travel, but the seaside community continued to flourish. The first public schools conducted in English were established. Mr. Cornelio Pascual, Sr. was the first English Teacher assigned in Vito. American missionaries were sent to tutor more Filipino English teachers.\n\nMeanwhile, sometime in 1907, the Insular Lumber Company, reputed to be the biggest hardwood lumber mill in the world, was established in what is now called Barangay Fabrica. Though measures to prevent the destruction of Sagay's rich forest were made, reforestation programs failed. Later, the old forest areas were converted mostly into sugarcane fields and some into cornfields. With the exhaustion of the forest resources of Sagay, the ILCO \u2013 Philippines was phased out in 1975 and later transferred to Hinoba-an.\n\nA major industrial development gave Sagay another big step forward: the establishment of Lopez Sugar Corporation in the 1920s. Also during these years, sugar, copra, lumber and fishing became the important source of income for the inhabitants. The economic growth of Sagay brought about influx of migrants from [[Iloilo]], [[Guimaras]], [[Cebu]] and [[Bohol]]. This trend made Sagay a melting pot of ethnically-different but equally-hardworking Cebuanos and Ilonggos. With these developments, business and industry flourished. Leading both sectors were big businessmen and industrialists like the Lopezes, the Cuaycongs, the Jisons, the Gamboas, and the Vasquezes. The sugar boom brought the \"old families\" into the industry like the Pueys, the Nichols, the Katalbases, and the Tupases, which branched out to the Mara\u00f1ons, the de la Pazes, the Ibrados and the Libo-ons.\n\n===World War II===\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, two Civil Governments existed in Sagay. Under the Japanese national government of Jose Laurel, Sr., Vicente Katalbas was appointed mayor, while the resistance government of the province, headed by Alfredo Montelibano, Sr. as governor, appointed Tomas Londres as Mayor whose seat of government was in the mountain areas of Sitio Balibag, Lopez Jaena. Their term however, abruptly ended when the combined Filipino and American forces liberated the province from the Japanese at the early part of 1945. When Sergio Osme\u00f1a, Sr., as vice-president to Manuel L. Quezon who died during the war, took over the helm of the national government, Teodoro Lopez, Sr. was appointed Mayor of Sagay. During his short term, Teodoro Lopez, Sr. concentrated in rebuilding the administrative machinery of the local government.\n\nSeveral hundreds of thousands of Filipino soldiers and officers of the 7th, 72nd and 75th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated and re-occupied the town of Sagay by attacking and driving off Japanese troops in 1945.\n\nThe factories were destroyed and the economy was in shambles. A Eusebio Lopez Memorial School Building in Barangay Paraiso served as the incarceration area for captured Filipino soldiers and American pilots and soldiers. It also served as the headquarters of Fourth Flight Division of the Japanese Imperial Air Force whose airfield was located in Pula-Bunglas area in Barangay Malubon.  During the last days of the war, the Fourth Flight Division of the Japanese Imperial Airforce organized kamikaze or suicide units to be stationed here and in Bacolod. Known later as the Third Regiment Suicide Corps, it was headed by Major Tsuneharu Sirai with Capt. Tetsuzu Kimura as his Chief Staff Officer. Of its 59 pilots and crews, 30 were killed in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] which they played a major role as kamikaze pilots. The Pula \u2013 Bunglas area of Barangay Malubon served as the Japanese landing field for the Fourth Flight Division. It was also a site where the local soldiers, guerrillas and civilians, after Japanese spies identified them as guerrilla members or collaborators, were forced to dig holes and consequently executed and buried. Old residents believe that almost 1,542 people were buried here.\n\nBarrio 3 Wharf, Fabrica served as the transport point of processed lumber destined to Japan from Insular Lumber Company and also a docking area of Japanese supply ship during the war-torn years. The Iglanggam Bridge at Barangay Tadlong served as the dumping site of executed local soldiers, guerrillas and civilians.  This is also known as the site where confiscated money, especially silver Peso coins encased in concrete blocks, were dumped by the retreating Japanese soldiers.\n\nBalibag Hill, Lopez Jaena was the place where the set of resistance government of Free Sagay under Mayor Tomas Londres (appointed by Island Governor Alfredo Montelibano, Sr.) was established. It was also known as tabo-an or market place during the war and in 1944, a group of Japanese soldiers killed about 27 homeguards or \"toltog\" guerrillas. After the mass killing, the Japanese soldiers set the whole area on fire, burning the shanties and the dead. The Japanese \"puppet\" government under Vicente Lacson Katalbas was established at the Big House, Central Lopez, Paraiso. A Japanese barracks and checkpoint was established. A Japanese anti-aircraft still can be found inside the ground of the house.\n\nAt Barangay Poblacion II, Japanese zero fighters left bullet holes when they intended to destroy the water supply of the people during the last days of the war. Holes from 60mm machine-guns left an indelible mark on the water tank.\n\nA training site of USAFFE (United States Army Forces in the Far East), under the supervision of Lt. Dominador Gaerland, was established at Tangnonon, Barangay Fabrica at the ancestral home of Lopez Kabayao.\n\nOn July 26, 1942, [[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the United States of America ordered a national mobilization in the Philippines and on August 23, 1942, the first group of reservist in Negros were called on duty by virtue of Philippine Army HQ order of August 4 and they were trained here. The first group reported in the said mobilization camp constituted the 71st Infantry Regiment.\n\n===Post war period===\nThe first election held right after the Second World War made Jose B. Puey, Sr. and Amalio Cueva, Sr. Mayor and Vice Mayor respectively. However, shortly after, Mayor Jose B. Puey, Sr. was appointed member of the Provincial Board of [[Negros Occidental]] thus Vice Mayor Amalio Cueva, Sr. took over the Municipal leadership and through his initiative, the seat of government was transferred to its present site, Dalusan. Incidentally, the transfer signaled the diminishing importance of sea travel and the takeover of overland transportation as the conveyor of progress and development. Old Sagay (the previous seat of government) is an old coastal center of population while Dalusan is a late highway occurrence. The transfer was made possible partly through land donations for the town site by Do\u00f1a Rosario Cooper and the heirs of the late Clayton Nichols. Schools, markets and commercial establishments were soon established. Jose B. Puey, Sr. remained Provincial Board Member until his election as congressman for the first District of Negros Occidental in 1953.\n\nIn the late 1950s, two Sagaynon politicians were in the forefront of Negros politics, Jose B. Puey, Sr. (Congressman from 1953 to 1957) and Alfredo E. Mara\u00f1on, Sr. (Board Member from 1956 to 1959). This meant that provincial and national aid were extended to Sagay. More roads and school buildings were constructed, thousands of hectares of logged off area of the Insular Lumber Company were planted with coconut trees and sugarcane. Sherman Hill, near Barangay Bato was discovered to contain rich deposits of the highest silica. The growing markets for sea products brought about unprecedented boom in the fishing industry for which the coastal waters of Sagay proved to equal the demand. The municipal population rose to more than 60,000 and the revenue increased.  After Mayor Amalio Cueva, came Tereso Canoy, Bruno Cueva, Sr. and Quintin Katalbas.\n\nIn 1963, Jose H. Puey, Jr. was elected mayor of Sagay. The income continued to rise. More schools were built and more roads, linking the barangays to the town capital, were constructed. The inefficient electrical system was updated, fire fighting equipment and the police units were modernized. It was during this time that Alfredo Mara\u00f1on Sr. began entertaining the idea of putting up another sugar mill in Sagay which farmers can partly own. He campaigned for support, but there was too much opposition even from some of his close friends. Nevertheless, his idea became a reality when in 1967, shortly after his death, Sagay Central Inc. was born. Mr. Mara\u00f1on's dream was made real through the help of [[Ferdinand Marcos|President Ferdinand E. Marcos]] and the then Philippine National Bank President Roberto S. Benedicto who both shared his vision for Sagay. With the new sugar mill at Barangay Bato, new areas were opened and planted with sugarcane. Today the new sugar mill factory is benefiting hundreds of small farmers.\n\nThe then Mayor, Congressman and now Governor of Negros Occidental Alfredo G. Mara\u00f1on, Jr. assumed the political leadership of Sagay in 1972. Under his administration, Sagay acquired a new town hall, a municipal gymnasium, a livestock auction market, public markets for a number of barangays and municipal wharves in barangays Vito and Old Sagay. He caused the organization of Sagay Water District in 1978. He effected the purchase of a municipal subdivision for the municipal employees in 1979. These achievements by themselves have helped make Sagay a first-class C municipality (the highest in the entire Negros). The then Mayor Alfredo G. Mara\u00f1on, Jr.'s successful negotiation of the sponsorship contract with the German District of [[Osterholz]] is his most important achievement.\n\n===Conversion into a city===\nIt had been a long time aspiration to get Sagay city status. The leadership of Mayor Joseph G. Mara\u00f1on and Vice Mayor Fortunato S. Javelosa inspired the authorship of Congressman Alfredo G. Mara\u00f1on of House Bill No. 6543, \"An Act Converting the Municipality of Sagay into a component city of Negros Occidental\" during the 10th Congress. Passing through the legislation process, a public hearing was held in Sagay City on February 22, 1996.  On May 3, 1996, Sen. Raul Roco sponsored the Senate Bill No. 1191, the Senate version of the cityhood. On June 11, 1996, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed into law RA8192, now the charter of Sagay City.  On June 10, 1996, the residents voted and ratified RA8192 and made Sagay, officially Sagay City.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Sagay\n| 1903 = 8311\n| 1918 = 17752\n| 1939 = 53767\n| 1948 = 67152\n| 1960 = 71335\n| 1970 = 79702\n| 1975 = 95421\n| 1980 = 99118\n| 1990 = 112700\n| 1995 = 128374\n| 2000 = 129765\n| 2007 = 140511\n| 2010 = 140740\n| 2015 = 146264\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\nSagay City's inhabitants are known to speak a mixture of [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].\n\n==Local government==\nThe elected mayor in 2007 Elections is Alfredo Mara\u00f1on Jr. with his vice mayor elect Leo Rafael Cueva.

Jesaji and Vejaji were able to get jagir of 64 villages from sultanate of Mohmud Begda  after fighting by remaining in outlawry for twelve years. Subsequently they settled in Hathasni.

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nuke.com/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|title=Sales of Worms skyrockets|work=[[Computer Game Review]]|publisher=[[Ziff-Davis]]|date=1996|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|archive-date=1996-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of... Worms|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=March 2006|pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series).

The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga.

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nuke.com/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|title=Sales of Worms skyrockets|work=[[Computer Game Review]]|publisher=[[Ziff-Davis]]|date=1996|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|archive-date=1996-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of...

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDevelopment", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}
