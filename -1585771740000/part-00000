First a [[Kohen|priest]] and then a [[Levite]] comes by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a [[Samaritan]] happens upon the traveller. Samaritans and Jews despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. [[Jesus]] is described as telling the [[parable]] in response to the question from a lawyer, \"And who is my neighbour?\". In response, Jesus tells the parable, the conclusion of which is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the man who shows mercy to the injured man\u2014that is, the Samaritan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Exposition of the Old Testament|last=Gill|first=John|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-0801037566|location=|date=1980|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians, such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul.<ref name=\"Caird, G.

The phrase \"[[Wikt: Good Samaritan|good Samaritan]]\", meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many [[Good Samaritan Hospital (disambiguation)|hospitals]] and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan.\n\n==Narrative==\nIn the [[Luke 10|Gospel of Luke chapter 10]], the parable is introduced by a question, known as the [[Great Commandment]]:\n\n{{quotation||Luke 10:25-29, [[World English Bible]]|text=Behold, a certain [[Rabbi|lawyer]]  stood up and tested him, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\"\n\nHe said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\"\n\nHe answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.\"\n\nHe said to him, \"You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.\"\n\nBut he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbor?\"}}\n\nJesus replies with a story:\n{{quotation||Luke 10:30\u201337, [[World English Bible]]|text=Jesus answered, \"A certain man was going down from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]], and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\"\n\nHe said, \"He who showed mercy on him.\"\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"}}\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:OldRoadFromJerusalemToJericho.jpg|thumb|240px|The road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]].]]\n\n===Road from Jerusalem to Jericho===\nIn the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the \"Way of Blood\" because \"of the blood which is often shed there by robbers\".<ref>Wilkinson, \"The Way from Jerusalem to Jericho\" The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Mar., 1975), pp. 10\u201324</ref> [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], in his \"[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]\" speech, on the day before his death, described the road as follows:\n\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|240px|A map of [[Israel (region)|Israel]] in the time of Jesus.

London, Penguin Books. 2004. p. 152-154.</ref>\n\nAs the story reached those who were unaware of the oppression of the Samaritans, this aspect of the parable became less and less discernible: fewer and fewer people ever heard of them in any context other than as a description. Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice.<ref>''Karl Barth's theological exegesis'' by Richard E.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ.<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom33.ii.vii.html Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke \u2013 Volume 3]''.</ref>}}\n\n[[Francis Schaeffer]] suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25-37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.

In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ.<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom33.ii.vii.html Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke \u2013 Volume 3]''.</ref>}}\n\n[[Francis Schaeffer]] suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25-37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.

Vincent van Gogh\u2019s painting captures the reverse hierarchy that is underscored in Luke\u2019s parable. Although the priest and Levite are near the top of the status hierarchy in Israel and the Samaritans near the bottom, van Gogh reverses this hierarchy in the painting. He foregrounds the Samaritan, making him larger than life and colorful, while the priest and Levite are placed in the background, making them small and insignificant, barely distinguished from the drab landscape. <ref>[[James L.

As Asimov put it, we need to think of the story occurring in Alabama in 1950, with a mayor and a preacher ignoring a man who has been beaten and robbed, with the role of the Samaritan being played by a poor black sharecropper.\n\nThe story's theme is portrayed throughout ''Marvel's Daredevil.''<ref>Meagan Damore, ''[https://www.cbr.com/anatomy-of-a-villain-the-secret-of-the-success-of-daredevils-kingpin/ Anatomy of a Villain: The Secret of the Success of \"Daredevil's\" Kingpin]'', cbr.com, 06.01.2015 Retrieved 05.08.2018</ref>\n\nThe parable of the Good Samaritan is the theme for the Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2003 coinage|Christian Charity commemorative coin]], minted 12 March 2003.

This period was followed by one of the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule or influence. The Germanic [[Vandal]]s invaded after that, followed by the equally brief re-establishment of a weak Roman rule by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Islamic [[Caliphates]] came to power under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The most enduring rule was that of the local Berber empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty]], [[Almohad Caliphate]], [[Hammadid dynasty]], [[Zirid dynasty]], [[Marinid dynasty]], [[Zayyanid dynasty]], and [[Wattasid dynasty]], extending from the 8th to 13th centuries.

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the [[morisco]]s and [[muladi]]es, that is, the indigenous [[Spaniards]] (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later were expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the [[Reconquista|Spanish Catholic Reconquista]]. Other European contributions included the French, Italian, and English crew and passengers taken captive by the [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]]. In some cases, they were returned to families if ransomed; in others, they were used as slaves or assimilated and adopted into tribes. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml | first = Robert| last= Davis | title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast |access-date=5 November 2009 |website=[[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the Maghreb was home to significant historic [[Jew]]ish communities called [[Maghrebim]], who predated the 7th-century introduction and conversion of the region to Islam. These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]].]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]].]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome. As late as the reign of Pope [[Benedict VII]] (974\u2013983), a new [[Archdiocese of Carthage|Archbishop of Carthage]] was consecrated. From the 10th century, Christianity declined in the region.<ref>Insoll, T.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.

This period was followed by one of the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule or influence. The Germanic [[Vandal]]s invaded after that, followed by the equally brief re-establishment of a weak Roman rule by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Islamic [[Caliphates]] came to power under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The most enduring rule was that of the local Berber empires of the [[Almoravid dynasty]], [[Almohad Caliphate]], [[Hammadid dynasty]], [[Zirid dynasty]], [[Marinid dynasty]], [[Zayyanid dynasty]], and [[Wattasid dynasty]], extending from the 8th to 13th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire]] for a period also controlled parts of the region.\n\nAlgeria, Libya, Mauritani, Morocco, and Tunisia established the Arab Maghreb Union in 1989 to promote cooperation and [[economic integration]] in a [[common market]].

These trade relations can be dated at least to the [[Phoenicians]] in the 1st millennium BC. (The Phoenician colony of [[Carthage]] was founded, according to tradition, in what is now Tunisia circa 800 BC).\n\nThe [[Berbers]] predominantly constructed their coastal ports and cities. Later, some Phoenicians and Carthaginians arrived for trade. The main Berber and Phoenician settlements centered in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] ([[Carthage]], [[Utica, Tunisia]]) along the North African [[littoral]], between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the Libyan coast east of ancient [[Cyrenaica]]. They dominated the trade and intercourse of the [[Western Mediterranean]] for centuries. The Carthage defeat in the [[Punic Wars]] in 206 BC allowed Rome to establish the [[Province of Africa]] and control many of these ports. Rome eventually took control of the entire Maghreb north of the Atlas Mountains. Rome was greatly helped by the defection of King [[Massinissa]] and Carthage's eastern Numidian [[Massylii]] client-allies. Some of the most mountainous regions, such as the Moroccan [[Rif]], remained outside Rome's control. The pressure put on the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Barbarian invasions]] (the [[Vandals]] and [[Hispania|Spain]]) in the 5th century reduced Roman control and led to the establishment of the [[Vandal Kingdom]]in 430 A.D. with its capital at Carthage. A century later, the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a force under General [[Belisarius]] that [[Vandalic War|succeeded in destroying]] the Vandal Kingdom. [[Exarchate of Carthage|Byzantine rule]] lasted for 150 years. The Berbers contested outside-the-area control. After the advent of [[Islam]] in the 640s\u2013700 AD period, Arabs took control of the entire region.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{main|Ifriqiya|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Idrisid dynasty|Almoravid dynasty|Kingdom of Africa|Almohad Caliphate|Hafsid dynasty|Marinid dynasty|Ziyyanid dynasty|Wattasid dynasty}}\n[[File:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], founded by the Arab general Uqba Ibn Nafi (in 670), is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&pg=PA128&dq=kairouan+oldest+mosque+maghreb&hl=fr&ei=YDg8TbPsH8vAswbDhszzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition'', World Wisdom, Inc, 2009, page 128]</ref>]]\n\nThe Arabs reached the Maghreb in early [[Umayyad]] times. Islamic Berber kingdoms such as the [[Almohad]]s expansion and the spread of [[Islam]] contributed to the development of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. While restricted due to the cost and dangers, the trade was highly profitable. Commodities traded included such goods as salt, gold, ivory, and [[Arab slave trade|enslaved persons from sub-Saharan regions]]. Arab control over the Maghreb was quite weak. Various Islamic variations, such as the [[Ibadi]]s and the [[Shia]], were adopted by some Berbers, often leading to scorning of [[Caliph]]al control in favour of their own interpretation of Islam.\n\nAs a result of the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arabs, the [[Arabic language]] and dialects spread slowly without eliminating Berber. These Arabs had been set upon the Berbers by the [[Fatimid]]s in punishment for their [[Zirid]] former Berber clients who defected and abandoned [[Shiism]] in the 12th century. Throughout this period, the Berber world most often was divided into three states, roughly corresponding to modern Morocco, western Algeria, and eastern Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. The region was occasionally briefly unified, as under the [[Almohad]] Berber empire, and briefly under the [[Marinid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{main|Barbary Coast|Saadi dynasty|Alaouite dynasty|Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman Tunisia|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n[[File:Guillaume Delisle North West Africa 1707.jpg|thumb|1707 map of northwest Africa by [[Guillaume Delisle]], including the Maghreb\nAfter the Middle Ages, the [[Ottoman Empire]] loosely controlled the area east of Morocco.]]\n\n===Modern history===\n{{further|Spanish Morocco|Spanish Sahara|French protectorate of Morocco|French Algeria|French Protectorate of Tunisia|Italian Libya}}\n{{further|North African Campaign (World War I)|North African Campaign|Western Desert Campaign}}\n{{further|Western Sahara War|Algerian War of Independence|History of Algeria since 1962|History of modern Tunisia|Kingdom of Libya|Libya under Gaddafi}}\nAfter the 19th century, areas of the Maghreb were colonized by [[France]], [[Spain]] and later [[Italy]].\n\nToday, more than two and a half million Maghrebi immigrants live in France, many from Algeria and Morocco.

In northern coastal towns, in particular, several waves of European immigrants influenced the population in the Medieval era. Most notable were the [[morisco]]s and [[muladi]]es, that is, the indigenous [[Spaniards]] (Moors) who were forcibly converted to Catholicism and later were expelled, together with ethnic Arab and Berber Muslims, from the [[Reconquista|Spanish Catholic Reconquista]]. Other European contributions included the French, Italian, and English crew and passengers taken captive by the [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]].

These were later augmented by Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who, fleeing the Spanish Catholic Inquisition of the 15th and 16th centuries, established a presence in North Africa. They settled primarily in the urban trading centers. Many Jews from Spain emigrated to North America from the Maghreb in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or to France and Israel later in the 20th century after the latter was founded.\n\nAnother significant group are Turks, who migrated with the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A large [[Kouloughli|ethnic Turkish]] population exists, particularly in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.\n\nSub-Saharan Africans joined the population mix during centuries of [[trans-Saharan trade]]. Traders and slaves went to the Maghreb from the [[Sahel]] region. On the Saharan southern edge of the Maghreb are small communities of black populations, sometimes called [[Haratine]]. They appear to have descended from black populations who inhabited the Sahara during its last wet period and then migrated north as it turned to desert.\n\nIn Algeria especially, a large European minority, known as the \"[[pied noir]]s\", immigrated to the region, settling under French colonial rule in late 19th century. They established farms and businesses. The overwhelming majority of these, however, left Algeria during and following the war for independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files_156/north-africa_5493/france-and-maghreb_5495/an-enhanced-partnership-with-the-maghreb-20.03.07_8821.html |title=France and Maghreb \u2013 An enhanced partnership with the Maghreb (March 20, 2007) |access-date=2007-07-11 |website=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Imedghasen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[mausoleum]] of [[Madghacen]].]]\nThe original religions of the peoples of the Maghreb seem<ref>[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/grasshoff.html]</ref> to have been based in and related to fertility cults of a strong [[Matriarchal religion|matriarchal pantheon]]. This theory is based on the social and linguistic structures of the [[Amazigh]] cultures that antedated all Egyptian and eastern Asian, northern Mediterranean, and European influences.\n\nHistoric records of religion in the Maghreb region show its gradual inclusion in the Classical World, with coastal colonies established first by Phoenicians, some Greeks, and later extensive conquest and colonization by the Romans. By the 2nd century of the common era, the area had become a center of Phoenician-speaking Christianity. Its bishops spoke and wrote in [[Punic]], and Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was noted by his local accent. Roman settlers and Romanized populations converted to Christianity. The region produced figures such as Christian church writer [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 \u2013 c. 202); and Christian martyrs or leading figures such as [[Perpetua|Perpetua and Felicity]] (martyrs, c. 200 CE); [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian of Carthage]] (+ 258); [[Monica (Christian saint)|St. Monica]]; her son the philosopher [[St. Augustine]], Bishop of Hippo I (+ 430) (1); and [[Julia of Corsica|St. Julia of Carthage]] (5th century).\n\n===Islam===\n[[File:Kabylie Christian family.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian [[Berbers|Berber]] family from [[Kabylia]].]]\n[[Islam]] arrived in 647 and challenged the domination of Christianity. The first permanent foothold of Islam was the founding in 667 of the city of [[Kairouan]], in present-day [[Tunisia]]. [[Carthage]] fell to Muslims in 698 and the remainder of the region fell by 709. Islamization proceeded slowly. \n\nFrom the end of the 7th century, over a period of more than 400 years, the region's peoples converted to Islam. Many left during this time for Italy, although surviving letters showed correspondence from regional Christians to Rome up until the 12th century. Christianity was still a living faith. Although there were numerous conversions after the conquest, Muslims did not become a majority until some time late in the 9th centur. During the 10th century, Islam became by far the dominant religion in the region.<ref>''Staying Roman,'' Jonathan Conant, pp.&nbsp;362\u2013368, 2012</ref> Christian bishoprics and dioceses continued to be active, and continued their relations with the Christian Church of Rome.

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (1073\u201385) consecrated a new bishop for Hippo. Christianity seems to have suffered several shocks that led to its demise. First, many upper-class, urban-dwelling, Latin-speaking Christians left for Europe after the Muslim conquest. The second major influence were the large-scale conversions to Islam from the end of the 9th century. Many Christians of a much reduced community departed in the mid-11th century, and remnants were evacuated in the 12th by the Norman rulers of Sicily. The Latin-African language lingered a while longer.\n\nThere was a small but thriving Jewish community, as well as a small Christian community. Most Muslims follow the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. Small [[Ibadi]] communities remain in some areas. A strong tradition of venerating [[marabout]]s and saints' tombs is found throughout regions inhabited by Berbers. This practice was also common among the Jews of the region. Any map of the region demonstrates the tradition by the proliferation of \"[[Sidi]]\"s, showing places named after the marabouts. This tradition has declined through the 20th century. A network of ''[[zaouia]]s'' traditionally helped teach basic literacy and knowledge of Islam in rural regions.\n\nCommunities of Christians, mostly [[Catholics]] and [[Protestant]], persist in [[Algeria]] (100,000\u2013380,000),<ref>Deeb, Mary Jane. \"Religious minorities\", ''Algeria (Country Study)''.

Over the following two or three centuries, such Jewish traders became known as the Maghribi, a distinctive social group who traveled throughout the Mediterranean world. They passed this identification on from father to son. Their tight-knit pan-Maghreb community had the ability to use social sanctions as a credible alternative to legal recourse, which was weak at the time anyway. This unique institutional alternative permitted the Maghribis to very successfully participate in Mediterranean trade.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Avner Greif | title = Contract Enforceability and Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders' Coalition | version = | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] in its journal [[American Economic Review]] | date= June 1993 | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_Papers/SSRNAUG202008.pdf | access-date = 2007-07-11 | author-link = Avner Greif }}.

The Maghreb's variations in elevation, rainfall, temperature, and soils give rise to distinct communities of plants and animals. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) identifies several distinct [[ecoregion]]s in the Maghreb.\n\n====Mediterranean Maghreb====\n[[File:Chamaerops humilis argentea1.jpg|thumb|[[Chamaerops|Dwarf fan palm]], grown in Maghrebi countries]]\nThe portions of the Maghreb between the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], along with coastal [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] in Libya, are home to [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]]. These ecoregions share many species of plants and animals with other portions of [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The southern extent of the Mediterranean Maghreb corresponds with the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Contour line#Precipitation and air moisture|isohyet]], or the southern range of the [[Olive|European Olive]] ''(Olea europea)''<ref>Dallman, Peter R.

Its central part is hyper-arid and supports little plant or animal life, but the northern portion of the desert receives occasional winter rains, while the strip along the Atlantic coast receives moisture from marine fog, which nourishes a greater variety of plants and animals. The northern edge of the Sahara corresponds to the 100&nbsp;mm isohyet, which is also the northern range of the [[date palm]] ''(Phoenix dactylifera)''.<ref name=\"Wickens\"/>\n* [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]]: This ecoregion lies along the northern edge of the Sahara, next to the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions of the Mediterranean Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south.

Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes ''([[erg (landform)|erg]])'', stone plateaus ''([[hamada]])'', gravel plains ''([[Desert pavement|reg]])'', dry valleys ''([[wadi]])'', and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square km (1,791,500 square miles) of Algeria, [[Chad]], Egypt, Libya, [[Mali]], Mauritania, [[Niger]], and [[Sudan]].<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1327|name=Sahara desert|access-date=December 31, 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Saharan halophytics]]: Seasonally flooded saline depressions in the Maghreb are home to [[halophytic]], or salt-adapted, plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover 54,000 square km (20,800 square miles), including [[Tunisian salt lakes]] of central Tunisia, [[Chott Melghir]] in Algeria, and other areas of Egypt, Algeria, Mauritania, and Western Sahara.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0905|name=Saharan halophytics|access-date=December 31, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:African Dinner-01.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional Maghrebi cuisine]]\n{{further|Moroccan cuisine}} {{further|Algerian cuisine}} {{further|Tunisian cuisine}}\n\nThe countries of the Maghreb share many cultural traditions. Among these is a culinary tradition that [[Habib Bourguiba]] defined as Western Arab, where [[couscous]] is the staple food, as opposed to Eastern Arab, where white rice is the staple food. In terms of food, similarities beyond the starches are found throughout the Arab world.\n\n==Genetics of the Maghreb population==\nThe Y-chromosome genetic structure of the Maghreb population seems to be modulated chiefly by geography. The Y-DNA Haplogroups [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and [[haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] make up the vast majority of the genetic markers of the populations of the Maghreb. Haplogroup [[haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most widespread among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of [[E-M81|E1b1b1b1a]], which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. Haplogroup J is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in Arabia and the Levant. Due to the distribution of [[E-M81]](E1b1b1b1a), which has reached its highest documented levels in the world at 95\u2013100% in some populations of the Maghreb, it has often been termed the \"Berber marker\" in the scientific literature.

The government of the province of Alberta is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[unicameral]] legislature\u2014the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]], which consists of 87 members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly].</ref>  The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and usually draws the members of Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The legislative powers in the province however, lie with the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]. Its government resembles that of the other Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. The capital of the province is [[Edmonton]], where the [[Alberta Legislative Building]] is located. Government is conducted after the [[Westminster System|Westminster model]]. \n\n==Government of Alberta==\n{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}\n\n[[File:JasperRoadEdmt.jpg|thumb|alt=Image looking west down Jasper Avenue showing the major financial centre in Edmonton|[[Jasper Avenue]], a hub of major offices and the financial centres in Edmonton.]]\n\nThe executive powers in the province lie with the Premier of Alberta and the Cabinet of Alberta or the Executive Council of Alberta. The legislative powers in the province lie with the [[Legislature of Alberta|Legislature]], which consists of two components: the [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen]], represented by the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]].\n\nThe Executive Council of Alberta is officially headed by the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], as representative of the [[Monarchy in Alberta|Queen in Right of Alberta]] and is referred to as the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]. Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is [[Jason Kenney]], who was sworn in as the 18th premier on April 30, 2019.\n\n==Legislative powers==\nThe Legislative Assembly meets in the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] in the provincial capital, [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe Legislative Assembly consists of 87 members, elected [[first past the post]] from single-member [[electoral district]]s.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly]</ref> The [[30th Alberta Legislature|current Legislature]] is the 30th, since the [[Alberta Act, 1905|creation of the province]] in 1905.\n\nThe last election was held on [[2019 Alberta general election|April 16, 2019]], and returned a majority parliament controlled by the [[United Conservative Party]] commonly abbreviated to 'UCP'.\n\n==Executive powers==\n\n===Executive Council of Alberta===\nTypically, although not necessarily consisting of members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], the Cabinet of Alberta is similar in structure and role to the [[Cabinet of Canada]].

Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or minister, the vice-regal, are selected by the [[Premier of Alberta]] and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], but this is not always the case. In the construct of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[responsible government]], the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, though it is important to note that, despite appearances of the contrary, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Neitsch |first=Alfred Thomas |title=A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=23 |publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association |location=Ottawa |year=2008 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |accessdate=May 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714043622/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAs at the federal level the most important Cabinet post after that of the leader is Minister of Finance.

The usual one is \"Alberta X\", (e.g. [[Alberta Education]]) the older style is \"Ministry of X\" (e.g. [[Ministry of Finance]]). The newer style without the word \"ministry\" resembles the federal government's [[Federal Identity Program]] and the federal naming scheme, except in reverse order. Federal ministries and departments are usually \"X Canada\" (e.g. [[Environment Canada]]).\n\nWith every new cabinet ministries can be created or disbanded, renamed or gain or lose responsibilities. Some ministries such as finance or health are common to all provincial governments and are comparable to similar ministries or departments at the federal level or indeed even in other countries. However, some ministries are quite distinct to Alberta, such as the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development which oversees the management of public lands.\n\nThese are the current ministries {{As of|2015|lc=on}}, listed alphabetically, with a short description and any notes to changes to that ministry's mandate.\n\n{|table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" colspan\"300\"|Ministry\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Notes\n|-\n|Indigenous Relations\n|Created 2008.

Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (\"Conservatives\" or \"Tories\"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] (and its predecessors, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party and the United Farmers of Alberta). A fourth party, the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], which began as a radical monetary reform movement and government but after 1944 governed in a right-wing Christian fundamentalist style, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell into powerlessness and disfavour after Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Progressive Conservatives were in government until 2015, when the NDP was elected with a large majority of the seats.\n\nOnly five parties have governed Alberta in the 110 years of its existence as a province: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015, and the NDP from 2015 on.\n\nAlberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]].

The government of the province of Alberta is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[unicameral]] legislature\u2014the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]], which consists of 87 members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly].</ref>  The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and usually draws the members of Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The legislative powers in the province however, lie with the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]. Its government resembles that of the other Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. The capital of the province is [[Edmonton]], where the [[Alberta Legislative Building]] is located. Government is conducted after the [[Westminster System|Westminster model]]. \n\n==Government of Alberta==\n{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}\n\n[[File:JasperRoadEdmt.jpg|thumb|alt=Image looking west down Jasper Avenue showing the major financial centre in Edmonton|[[Jasper Avenue]], a hub of major offices and the financial centres in Edmonton.]]\n\nThe executive powers in the province lie with the Premier of Alberta and the Cabinet of Alberta or the Executive Council of Alberta. The legislative powers in the province lie with the [[Legislature of Alberta|Legislature]], which consists of two components: the [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen]], represented by the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]].\n\nThe Executive Council of Alberta is officially headed by the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], as representative of the [[Monarchy in Alberta|Queen in Right of Alberta]] and is referred to as the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]. Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is [[Jason Kenney]], who was sworn in as the 18th premier on April 30, 2019.\n\n==Legislative powers==\nThe Legislative Assembly meets in the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] in the provincial capital, [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe Legislative Assembly consists of 87 members, elected [[first past the post]] from single-member [[electoral district]]s.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly]</ref> The [[30th Alberta Legislature|current Legislature]] is the 30th, since the [[Alberta Act, 1905|creation of the province]] in 1905.\n\nThe last election was held on [[2019 Alberta general election|April 16, 2019]], and returned a majority parliament controlled by the [[United Conservative Party]] commonly abbreviated to 'UCP'.\n\n==Executive powers==\n\n===Executive Council of Alberta===\nTypically, although not necessarily consisting of members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], the Cabinet of Alberta is similar in structure and role to the [[Cabinet of Canada]]. As federal and provincial responsibilities differ there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments.\n\nThe [[Lieutenant-Governors of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta]], as representative of the [[Monarchy in Alberta|Queen in Right of Alberta]], heads the council, and is referred to as the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or minister, the vice-regal, are selected by the [[Premier of Alberta]] and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], but this is not always the case. In the construct of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[responsible government]], the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, though it is important to note that, despite appearances of the contrary, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Neitsch |first=Alfred Thomas |title=A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=23 |publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association |location=Ottawa |year=2008 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |accessdate=May 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714043622/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAs at the federal level the most important Cabinet post after that of the leader is Minister of Finance.

The usual one is \"Alberta X\", (e.g. [[Alberta Education]]) the older style is \"Ministry of X\" (e.g. [[Ministry of Finance]]). The newer style without the word \"ministry\" resembles the federal government's [[Federal Identity Program]] and the federal naming scheme, except in reverse order. Federal ministries and departments are usually \"X Canada\" (e.g. [[Environment Canada]]).\n\nWith every new cabinet ministries can be created or disbanded, renamed or gain or lose responsibilities. Some ministries such as finance or health are common to all provincial governments and are comparable to similar ministries or departments at the federal level or indeed even in other countries. However, some ministries are quite distinct to Alberta, such as the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development which oversees the management of public lands.\n\nThese are the current ministries {{As of|2015|lc=on}}, listed alphabetically, with a short description and any notes to changes to that ministry's mandate.\n\n{|table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" colspan\"300\"|Ministry\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Notes\n|-\n|Indigenous Relations\n|Created 2008.

(source: the Government of Alberta website) Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (''see also [[Sales taxes in Canada]]'').\n\nGovernment revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).<ref name=\"Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength\">{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503001735/http://alberta.ca/budget2008/|archivedate=May 3, 2008|title=Budget 2009, Building on Our Strength|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=August 9, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] of 5%).

Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (\"Conservatives\" or \"Tories\"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] (and its predecessors, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party and the United Farmers of Alberta). A fourth party, the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], which began as a radical monetary reform movement and government but after 1944 governed in a right-wing Christian fundamentalist style, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell into powerlessness and disfavour after Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Progressive Conservatives were in government until 2015, when the NDP was elected with a large majority of the seats.\n\nOnly five parties have governed Alberta in the 110 years of its existence as a province: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015, and the NDP from 2015 on.\n\nAlberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. There are several currently active groups promoting the independence of Alberta.\n\nIn the [[2008 Alberta general election|2008 provincial election]], held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] members were elected.<ref name=\"2008 Alberta Election Results\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308170551/http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archivedate=March 8, 2008|title=2008 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nApril 23, 2012 [[2012 Alberta general election|election]] returned the Progressive Conservative Party to government, making leader [[Alison Redford]] Alberta's first female premier.<ref name=\"2012 Alberta Election Results\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/albertavotes2012/story/2012/04/23/albertavotes2012-election-results.html|title=2012 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref> In the 2012 provincial election, held on April 23, 2012, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government and party leader Alison Redford retained as premier with 43.9% of the vote and 61 of 87 seats (The Legislative Assembly had added 4 seats, increasing the total to 87), the Wildrose Party led by Danielle Smith was elected as the Official Opposition with 34.3% of the vote and 17 members (replacing the Liberal Party), five Liberals were elected with 9.9% of the vote and four NDP members were elected with 9.8% of the vote.<ref>[http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm Provincial General Election April 23, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426181333/http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm |date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMay 5, 2015 [[2015 Alberta general election|election]] saw the Alberta New Democrats elected to government, making leader [[Rachel Notley]] Alberta's second female premier and its first leftist premier since 1935.\n\nAfter a single term the NDP was defeated by the [[United Conservative Party]], who won the [[2019 Alberta general election|general election]] on April 16, 2019.

The [[National Energy Program]] sparked a great deal of bitterness against the federal government in [[Alberta]]; as well, the federal government involved itself in disputes over [[Petroleum|oil]] with [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dyck|2012|pp=416\u2013420}}</ref>\nWith the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] through the addition of section 92A to the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], the provinces were given more power with respect to their natural resources.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1992 the federal government favoured [[devolution]] of powers to the provinces, culminating in the failed [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown]] accords.  After a merger with the heavily devolutionist [[Canadian Alliance]], the new [[Conservative Party of Canada]] under [[Stephen Harper]] has continued the same stance.<ref name=federalism1983>\n{{Cite book\n| last=Banting\n| first=Keith G.\n|author2=Simeon, Richard\n| title=And no one cheered: federalism, democracy, and the Constitution Act\n| publisher=Methuen\n| year=1983\n| location=Toronto\n| pages=14, 16\n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUwOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| isbn=0-458-95950-2\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|Politics}}\n* [[List of premiers of Alberta]]\n* [[List of Alberta general elections]]\n* [[Politics of Canada]]\n* [[Council of the Federation]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |last =Connors |first = Richard |author2=John M.
