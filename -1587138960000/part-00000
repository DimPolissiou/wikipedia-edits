He is currently unemployed and gets to perform these roles because it fetches him good money. His friend Smiley runs a liquor shop and supports him in his every endeavor. His father, Jagjeet Singh runs a shop dealing in funeral items and is sunk deep into loans he owes to various banks. Due to low turnover, he is unable to pay back the EMI's. \n\nWhile returning from an unsuccessful interview for a job, Karam sees an ad that promises Rs. 70,000/month salary. He reaches the given address, but the employer Mauji 'W Ji' (Rajesh Sharma) rejects him outright without inquiring about his qualifications. Karamveer pleads, and finally, Mauji relents and shows him his call center where only ladies work. The call-center is entertaining fantasies of people who call them, mostly men who don't have a partner in life. Karamveer is shocked but quickly regains his composure, and answers a call in a female voice for Ms. Pooja, who frequently is on leave. Mauji is impressed with his skill and immediately hires him and gives him Rs. 50,000 as advance payment. Karamveer tells his father that he has got a job at an MNC and handovers him the advance payment he received. His father is happy at this news, while Karam celebrates with his friend Smiley. Later at the job, he garners a good fan base because of his sweet voice and sharp presence of mind. \n\nHe comes across Mahi at his customer's home where he went to deliver products asked from his father's shop. He is smitten by her beauty and catches her attention with some witty lines. Later they come across each other while waiting in a queue, and Karam impresses her with his funny personality and love blossoms between the two and soon they get engaged.\n\nAt his job, Karam comes across a few people who call him regularly: Toto, a spoilt brat; Rajpal, a policeman by profession who writes couplets; Roma, editor of a magazine; Karam's father Jagjeet and Mahi's brother,  Mahinder. Karam, initially unknown of their real identities, eventually, comes across them in his life and is surprised to know their identities. Eventually, everyone becomes obsessed with Puja, impersonated by Karam, because of her sweet voice and friendly nature. They fall in love with Puja and everyone wants to marry her. \n\nKaram, frustrated with such unsolicited requests, offers to quit. His employer, Mauji rejects his resignation and blackmails him that he would expose his identity to his neighborhood, which might jeopardize his marriage. Karam decides to tell everything to Mahi but fizzles out when he realizes her brother Mahinder is also a fan of Puja. He figures out that if he talks rudely with his callers, they would get along with their realities and stop calling him. This move backfires as everyone becomes more obsessed with Puja, Toto attempts to commit suicide, and Rajpal threatens to abandon his wife.\n\nKaramveer starts threatening these people to stay away from Puja or otherwise face the consequences in an attempt to stop them from marrying Puja.\n\nIn one such event, Karamveer as  Puja tells Roma that she is in love with her boyfriend Anurag. Roma insists upon meeting Anurag to see if he is a good guy. Karamveer meets Roma at a mall posing as Anurag. After the meeting, he comes across Mahinder, shopping at the mall who overhears Roma and Karam and tells it to Mahi, also present at the mall. Roma, already skeptical of Karamveer alias Anurag's character, tells Mahi that Karam is engaged to Puja when Mahi reveals that she is  Karam's fianc\u00e9, and his duplicity is exposed. Mahi, heartbroken, leaves from the mall when Karamveer is not able to explain the situation to her. Confusion breaks out in the mall and Puja's identity remains tumultuous.\n\nKaram chases Mahi and takes her to his office and explains everything. Mauji misbehaves with Mahi and she slaps him in front of his staff. Karamveer defends Mahi and leaves the office, further enraging Mauji. Mahi reconciles with Karamveer.\nLater, she attends the play where Karam is playing the role of Radha. At the end of the play, Rajpal arrives with Mauji who claim that Karam has killed Puja. Karam recites one of Rajpal's couplet. Rajpal is taken aback since he shared the couplet with Puja and nobody else.\n\nKaram reveals that he has been impersonating Puja all this while. This is followed by an emotional speech by Karam on growing loneliness amongst people. Roma comes with the real Puja and exposes Mauji who is arrested by Rajpal. \nToto, Mahinder, Jagjeet, and Roma learn that Karam has been impersonating Puja all the while. Finally, everyone refuses to marry Karam except Mahi.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ayushmann Khurrana]] as Karamveer \"Karam\" Singh/Pooja\n* [[Nushrat Bharucha]] as Mahi Rajput\n* [[Annu Kapoor]] as Jagjeet Singh\n* [[Manjot Singh]] as Smiley Singh\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Rajpal Kirar\n* [[Abhishek Banerjee (actor)|Abhishek Banerjee]] as Mahinder Rajput\n* Raj Bhansali as Chandu \u201cToto\u201d Pushp\n* [[Nidhi Bisht]] as Roma Gupta\n* Neela Mulherkar as Dadi\n* Neha Saraf as Chandrakanta Kirar\n* Jitender Gaur as Toto's father\n* Arihant as Sonu Kirar\n* Gagan Gupta as Director\n* Saurabh Nayyar as Ram\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as W, owner of call centre\n* Vaibhav Mathur as Dablu's assistant\n* Sahasi Ranjan as Hanuman\n* Yash Yogen as Laxman\n* Basant Garg as Deepak\n* Sukesh Anand as Ravan\n* Vedika Bhandari as Pooja (Original)\n* Habib Azmi as Kazi\n* [[Riteish Deshmukh]] (special appearance in song \"Dhagala Lagali\")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/riteish-deshmukh-shakes-a-leg-with-ayushmann-khurrana-and-nushrat-bharucha-in-the-recreated-version-of-an-iconic-dada-kondke-song/articleshow/70775937.cms|website=Mumbai Mirror|title=Riteish Deshmukh shakes a leg with Ayushmann Khurrana and NuNushrat Bharucha in the recreated version of an iconic Dada Kondke Song|date=22 August 2019|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2018 [[Ayushmann Khurrana]] announced ''Dream Girl'' to be written and directed by [[Raaj Shaandilyaa]] and produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]], [[Shobha Kapoor]] and [[Aashish Singh]].

He is currently unemployed and gets to perform these roles because it fetches him good money. His friend Smiley runs a liquor shop and supports him in his every endeavor. His father, Jagjeet Singh runs a shop dealing in funeral items and is sunk deep into loans he owes to various banks. Due to low turnover, he is unable to pay back the EMI's. \n\nWhile returning from an unsuccessful interview for a job, Karam sees an ad that promises Rs. 70,000/month salary. He reaches the given address, but the employer Mauji 'W Ji' (Rajesh Sharma) rejects him outright without inquiring about his qualifications. Karamveer pleads, and finally, Mauji relents and shows him his call center where only ladies work. The call-center is entertaining fantasies of people who call them, mostly men who don't have a partner in life. Karamveer is shocked but quickly regains his composure, and answers a call in a female voice for Ms. Pooja, who frequently is on leave. Mauji is impressed with his skill and immediately hires him and gives him Rs. 50,000 as advance payment. Karamveer tells his father that he has got a job at an MNC and handovers him the advance payment he received. His father is happy at this news, while Karam celebrates with his friend Smiley. Later at the job, he garners a good fan base because of his sweet voice and sharp presence of mind. \n\nHe comes across Mahi at his customer's home where he went to deliver products asked from his father's shop. He is smitten by her beauty and catches her attention with some witty lines. Later they come across each other while waiting in a queue, and Karam impresses her with his funny personality and love blossoms between the two and soon they get engaged.\n\nAt his job, Karam comes across a few people who call him regularly: Toto, a spoilt brat; Rajpal, a policeman by profession who writes couplets; Roma, editor of a magazine; Karam's father Jagjeet and Mahi's brother,  Mahinder. Karam, initially unknown of their real identities, eventually, comes across them in his life and is surprised to know their identities. Eventually, everyone becomes obsessed with Puja, impersonated by Karam, because of her sweet voice and friendly nature. They fall in love with Puja and everyone wants to marry her. \n\nKaram, frustrated with such unsolicited requests, offers to quit. His employer, Mauji rejects his resignation and blackmails him that he would expose his identity to his neighborhood, which might jeopardize his marriage. Karam decides to tell everything to Mahi but fizzles out when he realizes her brother Mahinder is also a fan of Puja. He figures out that if he talks rudely with his callers, they would get along with their realities and stop calling him. This move backfires as everyone becomes more obsessed with Puja, Toto attempts to commit suicide, and Rajpal threatens to abandon his wife.\n\nKaramveer starts threatening these people to stay away from Puja or otherwise face the consequences in an attempt to stop them from marrying Puja.\n\nIn one such event, Karamveer as  Puja tells Roma that she is in love with her boyfriend Anurag. Roma insists upon meeting Anurag to see if he is a good guy. Karamveer meets Roma at a mall posing as Anurag. After the meeting, he comes across Mahinder, shopping at the mall who overhears Roma and Karam and tells it to Mahi, also present at the mall. Roma, already skeptical of Karamveer alias Anurag's character, tells Mahi that Karam is engaged to Puja when Mahi reveals that she is  Karam's fianc\u00e9, and his duplicity is exposed. Mahi, heartbroken, leaves from the mall when Karamveer is not able to explain the situation to her. Confusion breaks out in the mall and Puja's identity remains tumultuous.\n\nKaram chases Mahi and takes her to his office and explains everything. Mauji misbehaves with Mahi and she slaps him in front of his staff. Karamveer defends Mahi and leaves the office, further enraging Mauji. Mahi reconciles with Karamveer.\nLater, she attends the play where Karam is playing the role of Radha. At the end of the play, Rajpal arrives with Mauji who claim that Karam has killed Puja. Karam recites one of Rajpal's couplet. Rajpal is taken aback since he shared the couplet with Puja and nobody else.\n\nKaram reveals that he has been impersonating Puja all this while. This is followed by an emotional speech by Karam on growing loneliness amongst people. Roma comes with the real Puja and exposes Mauji who is arrested by Rajpal. \nToto, Mahinder, Jagjeet, and Roma learn that Karam has been impersonating Puja all the while. Finally, everyone refuses to marry Karam except Mahi.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ayushmann Khurrana]] as Karamveer \"Karam\" Singh/Pooja\n* [[Nushrat Bharucha]] as Mahi Rajput\n* [[Annu Kapoor]] as Jagjeet Singh\n* [[Manjot Singh]] as Smiley Singh\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Rajpal Kirar\n* [[Abhishek Banerjee (actor)|Abhishek Banerjee]] as Mahinder Rajput\n* Raj Bhansali as Chandu \u201cToto\u201d Pushp\n* [[Nidhi Bisht]] as Roma Gupta\n* Neela Mulherkar as Dadi\n* Neha Saraf as Chandrakanta Kirar\n* Jitender Gaur as Toto's father\n* Arihant as Sonu Kirar\n* Gagan Gupta as Director\n* Saurabh Nayyar as Ram\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as W, owner of call centre\n* Vaibhav Mathur as Dablu's Assistant\n* Sahasi Ranjan as Hanuman\n* Yash Yogen as Laxman\n* Basant Garg as Deepak\n* Sukesh Anand as Ravan\n* Vedika Bhandari as Pooja (Original)\n* Habib Azmi as Kazi\n* [[Riteish Deshmukh]] (special appearance in song \"Dhagala Lagali\")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/riteish-deshmukh-shakes-a-leg-with-ayushmann-khurrana-and-nushrat-bharucha-in-the-recreated-version-of-an-iconic-dada-kondke-song/articleshow/70775937.cms|website=Mumbai Mirror|title=Riteish Deshmukh shakes a leg with Ayushmann Khurrana and NuNushrat Bharucha in the recreated version of an iconic Dada Kondke Song|date=22 August 2019|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2018 [[Ayushmann Khurrana]] announced ''Dream Girl'' to be written and directed by [[Raaj Shaandilyaa]] and produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]], [[Shobha Kapoor]] and [[Aashish Singh]].

He attended the Burnley Road School until he was seven, when his family moved to [[Mexborough]], then attending Schofield Street junior school.<ref name=\"NDB\"/> His parents ran a newsagent's and tobacconist's shop.<ref name=\"Bellp4\"/> In ''Poetry in Making'' he recalled that he was fascinated by animals, collecting and drawing toy lead creatures. He acted as retriever when his elder brother gamekeeper shot magpies, owls, rats and curlews, growing up surrounded by the harsh realities of working farms in the valleys and on the moors.<ref name=\"Sagar6\">Sagar (1978), p6</ref>  During his time in Mexborough, he explored Manor Farm at Old [[Denaby]], which he said he would come to know \"better than any place on earth\". His earliest poem \"The Thought Fox\", and earliest story \"The Rain Horse\"  were recollections of the area. A close friend at the time, John Wholly, took Hughes to the Crookhill estate above Conisbrough where the boys spent great swathes of time. Hughes became close to the family and learnt a lot about wildlife from Wholly's father, a gamekeeper. He came to view fishing as an almost religious experience.<ref name=\"NDB\"/>\n\nHughes attended Mexborough Grammar School, where a succession of teachers encouraged him to write, and develop his interest in poetry. Teachers Miss McLeod and Pauline Mayne introduced him to the poets Hopkins and Eliot. Hughes was mentored by his sister Olwyn, who was well versed in poetry, and another teacher, John Fisher.<ref name=\"NDB\"/><ref name=\"Sagar7\"/> Poet [[Harold Massingham]] also attended this school and was also mentored by Fisher. In 1946, one of Hughes's early poems, \"Wild West\", and a short story were published in the grammar school magazine ''The Don and Dearne'', followed by further poems in 1948.<ref name=\"Bellp4\"/> By 16, he had no other thought than being a poet.<ref name=\"NDB\"/>\n\nDuring the same year, Hughes won an open [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] in English at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], but chose to do his [[National Service]] first.<ref>Keith M. Sagar (1981). ''Ted Hughes'' p.9. University of Michigan</ref> His two years of National Service (1949\u201351) passed comparatively easily. Hughes was stationed as a ground wireless mechanic in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on an isolated three-man station in east Yorkshire, a time during which he had nothing to do but \"read and reread Shakespeare and watch the grass grow\".<ref name=\"Bellp4\"/> He learnt many of the plays by heart and memorised great quantities of [[W. B. Yeats]]'s poetry.<ref name=\"NDB\"/>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1951, Hughes initially studied English at Pembroke College under M.J.C. Hodgart, an authority on [[ballad]]ic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart's supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the \"terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus\" of literary tradition.<ref name=\"NDB\"/><ref name=\"Sagar8\">Sagar (1978), p. 8</ref> He wrote, \"I might say, that I had as much talent for [[F.

But I learned my lesson early... If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech... The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts.

He oversaw the publication of her manuscripts, including ''[[Ariel (Plath)|Ariel]]'' (1966). Some critics were dissatisfied by his choice of poem order and omissions in the book<ref name=\"Bellp8\"/> and some critics of Hughes argued that he had essentially driven her to suicide and therefore should not be responsible for her literary legacy.<ref name=\"Bellp8\"/>  He claimed to have destroyed the final volume of Plath's journal, detailing their last few months together.

In 1959 he won the Galbraith prize, which brought $5,000. His most significant work is perhaps ''[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]'' (1970), which whilst it has been widely praised also divided critics, combining an apocalyptic, bitter, cynical and surreal view of the universe with what sometimes appeared simple, childlike verse. Crow was edited several times across Hughes' career. Within its opus he created a cosmology of the totemic Crow who was simultaneously God, Nature and Hughes' alter ego. The publication of Crow shaped Hughes' poetic career as distinct from other forms of English Nature Poetry.\n\nIn a 1971 interview with ''[[The London Magazine]]'', Hughes cited his main influences as including [[William Blake|Blake]], [[John Donne|Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]] and [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]. He mentioned also [[Schopenhauer]], [[Robert Graves]]'s book ''The White Goddess'' and ''[[Bardo Thodol|The Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.<ref name=\"Bell11\">Bell (2002) p11</ref>\n\nHughes worked for 10 years on a [[prose poem]], \"Gaudete\", which he hoped to have made into a film. It tells the story of the vicar of an English village who is carried off by elemental spirits, and replaced in the village by his [[Enantiodromia|enantiodromic]] double, a changeling, fashioned from a log, who nevertheless has the same memories as the original vicar. The double is a force of nature who organises the women of the village into a \"love coven\" in order that he may father a new messiah. When the male members of the community discover what is going on, they murder him. The epilogue consists of a series of lyrics spoken by the restored priest in praise of a nature goddess, inspired by [[Robert Graves]]'s ''White Goddess''. It was printed in 1977. Hughes was very interested in the relationship between his poetry and the book arts, and many of his books were produced by notable presses and in collaborative editions with artists, for instance with [[Leonard Baskin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hydrohotel.net/Hughes1.htm |title=Richard Price, Ted Hughes and the Book Arts |publisher=Hydrohotel.net |date=17 August 1930 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his own poetry, Hughes wrote a number of translations of European plays, mainly classical ones. His ''[[Tales from Ovid]]'' (1997) contains a selection of [[free verse]] translations from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. He also wrote both poetry and prose for children, one of his most successful books being ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'', written to comfort his children after their mother Sylvia Plath's suicide. It later became the basis of [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[rock opera]] of the same name, and of the animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.\n\nHughes was appointed [[Poet Laureate]] in 1984 following the death of [[John Betjeman]]. It was later known that Hughes was second choice for the appointment. [[Philip Larkin]], the preferred nominee, had declined, because of ill health and a loss of creative momentum, dying a year later. Hughes served in this position until his death in 1998. In 1992 Hughes published ''[[Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being]]'', a monumental work inspired by Graves's ''[[The White Goddess]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/shakespeare-and-goddess-of-complete-being/9780571166046/|title=Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being|website=Faber.co.uk|accessdate=23 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101010341/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/shakespeare-and-goddess-of-complete-being/9780571166046|archivedate=1 January 2011}}</ref> The book, considered Hughes's key work of prose, had a mixed reception \"divided between those who considered it an important and original appreciation of Shakespeare\u2019s complete works, whilst others dismissed it as a lengthy and idiosyncratic appreciation of Shakespeare refracted by Hughes\u2019s personal belief system\".

It is very interesting and would cause a minor sensation\" (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in ''Birthday Letters'' and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: \"I have a whole pile of pieces that are all \u2013 one way or another \u2013 little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me\" (5 April 1997).\n\n===Themes===\n{{Quote box |align=right|quoted=|bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n|quote =<poem>\nThis house has been far out at sea all night,\nThe woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,\nWinds stampeding the fields under the window\nFloundering black astride and blinding wet\n\nTill day rose; then under an orange sky\nThe hills had new places, and wind wielded\nBlade-light, luminous black and emerald,\nFlexing like the lens of a mad eye.\n</poem>\n|source =From \"Wind\" <br/> ''[[The Hawk in the Rain]]'', 1957<ref name=\"poetryarchive.org\"/>}}\n\nHughes's earlier poetic work is rooted in nature and, in particular, the innocent savagery of animals, an interest from an early age.

He attended the Burnley Road School until he was seven, when his family moved to [[Mexborough]], then attending Schofield Street junior school.<ref name=\"NDB\"/> His parents ran a newsagent's and tobacconist's shop.<ref name=\"Bellp4\"/> In ''Poetry in Making'' he recalled that he was fascinated by animals, collecting and drawing toy lead creatures. He acted as retriever when his elder brother gamekeeper shot magpies, owls, rats and curlews, growing up surrounded by the harsh realities of working farms in the valleys and on the moors.<ref name=\"Sagar6\">Sagar (1978), p6</ref>  During his time in Mexborough, he explored Manor Farm at Old [[Denaby]], which he said he would come to know \"better than any place on earth\". His earliest poem \"The Thought Fox\", and earliest story \"The Rain Horse\"  were recollections of the area. A close friend at the time, John Wholly, took Hughes to the Crookhill estate above Conisbrough where the boys spent great swathes of time. Hughes became close to the family and learnt a lot about wildlife from Wholly's father, a gamekeeper. He came to view fishing as an almost religious experience.<ref name=\"NDB\"/>\n\nHughes attended Mexborough Grammar School, where a succession of teachers encouraged him to write, and develop his interest in poetry. Teachers Miss McLeod and Pauline Mayne introduced him to the poets Hopkins and Eliot. Hughes was mentored by his sister Olwyn, who was well versed in poetry, and another teacher, John Fisher.<ref name=\"NDB\"/><ref name=\"Sagar7\"/> Poet [[Harold Massingham]] also attended this school and was also mentored by Fisher. In 1946, one of Hughes's early poems, \"Wild West\", and a short story were published in the grammar school magazine ''The Don and Dearne'', followed by further poems in 1948.<ref name=\"Bellp4\"/> By 16, he had no other thought than being a poet.<ref name=\"NDB\"/>\n\nDuring the same year, Hughes won an open [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] in English at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], but chose to do his [[National Service]] first.<ref>Keith M. Sagar (1981). ''Ted Hughes'' p.9. University of Michigan</ref> His two years of National Service (1949\u201351) passed comparatively easily. Hughes was stationed as a ground wireless mechanic in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on an isolated three-man station in east Yorkshire, a time during which he had nothing to do but \"read and reread Shakespeare and watch the grass grow\".<ref name=\"Bellp4\"/> He learnt many of the plays by heart and memorised great quantities of [[W. B. Yeats]]'s poetry.<ref name=\"NDB\"/>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1951, Hughes initially studied English at Pembroke College under M.J.C. Hodgart, an authority on [[ballad]]ic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart's supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the \"terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus\" of literary tradition.<ref name=\"NDB\"/><ref name=\"Sagar8\">Sagar (1978), p. 8</ref> He wrote, \"I might say, that I had as much talent for [[F.

But I learned my lesson early... If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech... The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts.

He oversaw the publication of her manuscripts, including ''[[Ariel (Plath)|Ariel]]'' (1966). Some critics were dissatisfied by his choice of poem order and omissions in the book<ref name=\"Bellp8\"/> and some critics of Hughes argued that he had essentially driven her to suicide and therefore should not be responsible for her literary legacy.<ref name=\"Bellp8\"/>  He claimed to have destroyed the final volume of Plath's journal, detailing their last few months together.

In 1959 he won the Galbraith prize, which brought $5,000. His most significant work is perhaps ''[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]'' (1970), which whilst it has been widely praised also divided critics, combining an apocalyptic, bitter, cynical and surreal view of the universe with what sometimes appeared simple, childlike verse. Crow was edited several times across Hughes' career. Within its opus he created a cosmology of the totemic Crow who was simultaneously God, Nature and Hughes' alter ego. The publication of Crow shaped Hughes' poetic career as distinct from other forms of English Nature Poetry.\n\nIn a 1971 interview with ''[[The London Magazine]]'', Hughes cited his main influences as including [[William Blake|Blake]], [[John Donne|Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]] and [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]. He mentioned also [[Schopenhauer]], [[Robert Graves]]'s book ''The White Goddess'' and ''[[Bardo Thodol|The Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.<ref name=\"Bell11\">Bell (2002) p11</ref>\n\nHughes worked for 10 years on a [[prose poem]], \"Gaudete\", which he hoped to have made into a film. It tells the story of the vicar of an English village who is carried off by elemental spirits, and replaced in the village by his [[Enantiodromia|enantiodromic]] double, a changeling, fashioned from a log, who nevertheless has the same memories as the original vicar. The double is a force of nature who organises the women of the village into a \"love coven\" in order that he may father a new messiah. When the male members of the community discover what is going on, they murder him. The epilogue consists of a series of lyrics spoken by the restored priest in praise of a nature goddess, inspired by [[Robert Graves]]'s ''White Goddess''. It was printed in 1977. Hughes was very interested in the relationship between his poetry and the book arts, and many of his books were produced by notable presses and in collaborative editions with artists, for instance with [[Leonard Baskin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hydrohotel.net/Hughes1.htm |title=Richard Price, Ted Hughes and the Book Arts |publisher=Hydrohotel.net |date=17 August 1930 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his own poetry, Hughes wrote a number of translations of European plays, mainly classical ones. His ''[[Tales from Ovid]]'' (1997) contains a selection of [[free verse]] translations from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. He also wrote both poetry and prose for children, one of his most successful books being ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'', written to comfort his children after Sylvia Plath's suicide. It later became the basis of [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[rock opera]] of the same name, and of the animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.\n\nHughes was appointed [[Poet Laureate]] in 1984 following the death of [[John Betjeman]]. It was later known that Hughes was second choice for the appointment. [[Philip Larkin]], the preferred nominee, had declined, because of ill health and a loss of creative momentum, dying a year later. Hughes served in this position until his death in 1998. In 1992 Hughes published ''[[Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being]]'', a monumental work inspired by Graves's ''[[The White Goddess]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/shakespeare-and-goddess-of-complete-being/9780571166046/|title=Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being|website=Faber.co.uk|accessdate=23 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101010341/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/shakespeare-and-goddess-of-complete-being/9780571166046|archivedate=1 January 2011}}</ref> The book, considered Hughes's key work of prose, had a mixed reception \"divided between those who considered it an important and original appreciation of Shakespeare\u2019s complete works, whilst others dismissed it as a lengthy and idiosyncratic appreciation of Shakespeare refracted by Hughes\u2019s personal belief system\".

In ''[[Birthday Letters]]'', his last collection, Hughes broke his silence on Plath, detailing aspects of their life together and his own behaviour at the time.

It is very interesting and would cause a minor sensation\" (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in ''Birthday Letters'' and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: \"I have a whole pile of pieces that are all \u2013 one way or another \u2013 little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me\" (5 April 1997).\n\n===Themes===\n{{Quote box |align=right|quoted=|bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n|quote =<poem>\nThis house has been far out at sea all night,\nThe woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,\nWinds stampeding the fields under the window\nFloundering black astride and blinding wet\n\nTill day rose; then under an orange sky\nThe hills had new places, and wind wielded\nBlade-light, luminous black and emerald,\nFlexing like the lens of a mad eye.\n</poem>\n|source =From \"Wind\" <br/> ''[[The Hawk in the Rain]]'', 1957<ref name=\"poetryarchive.org\"/>}}\n\nHughes's earlier poetic work is rooted in nature and, in particular, the innocent savagery of animals, an interest from an early age. He wrote frequently of the mixture of beauty and violence in the natural world.<ref name=\"Bellp1\">Bell (2002) p1</ref> Animals serve as a metaphor for his view on life: animals live out a struggle for the [[survival of the fittest]] in the same way that humans strive for ascendancy and success. Examples can be seen in the poems \"Hawk Roosting\" and \"Jaguar\".<ref name=\"Bellp1\"/>\n\nThe [[West Riding]] dialect of Hughes's childhood remained a staple of his poetry, his lexicon lending a texture that is concrete, terse, emphatic, economical yet powerful. The manner of speech renders the hard facts of things and wards off self-indulgence.<ref name=\"Sagar7\">Sagar (1978) p7</ref>\n\nHughes's later work is deeply reliant upon myth and the British [[bard]]ic tradition, heavily inflected with a [[modernism|modernist]], [[Jungian]] and ecological viewpoint.<ref name=\"Bellp1\"/> He re-worked classical and archetypal myth working with a conception of the dark sub-conscious.<ref name=\"Bellp1\"/>\n\n=== Translation ===\nIn 1965, he founded with [[Daniel Weissbort]] the journal ''[[Modern Poetry in Translation]]'', which involved bringing to the attention of the West the work of [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]], who would later go on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Weissbort and Hughes were instrumental in bringing to the English-speaking world the work of many poets who were hardly known, from such countries as Poland and Hungary, then controlled by the Soviet Union.
