The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing the [[Russian America|colony of Alaska]] that spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km<sup>2</sup>). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912.

After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.\n[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814]]\n\nBetween 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.\n\n[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.\n\nOn March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2&nbsp;million. It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at \"Castle Hill\". Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.\n\n[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.\n\n[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\nFor most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.

Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year.

The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska\u2014Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n\n{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\n\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides.

Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.\n\n===Energy===\n\n{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}\n[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].

The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\n\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans.

Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth\u2014USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heavy-lift_melon.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right)\n}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs.

The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.

In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less.

It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.)

[[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and [[Fairbanks International Airport|Fairbanks]] to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.\n[[File:ERA Aviation prop plane landing at ANC (6194226738).jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier Dash 8]], operated by [[Era Alaska]], on approach to [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]]]\n\nThe bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Ravn Alaska]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.\n\nMany communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.<ref>\nOut of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 were pilots, or about one in 78, Federal Aviation Administration.

In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a {{convert|1150|mi|adj=on}} trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=out}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige.

The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.\n\nRepublican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State representative [[Lisa Murkowski]], as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004, 2010 and 2016.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"160\" heights=\"160\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Alaska's current statewide elected officials\">\nFile:Mike Dunleavy official photo (cropped).jpg|[[Mike Dunleavy (politician)|Mike Dunleavy]], [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]]\nFile:Lisa Murkowski official photo (cropped).jpg|[[Lisa Murkowski]], senior [[List of United States Senators from Alaska|United States Senator]]\nFile:Senator Dan Sullivan official.jpg|[[Dan Sullivan (U.S. senator)|Dan Sullivan]], junior United States Senator\nFile:Don Young, official 115th Congress photo portrait (cropped).jpg|[[Don Young]], [[List of United States Representatives from Alaska|United States Representative]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Cities, towns and boroughs==\n\n{{See also|List of cities in Alaska by population|Alaska locations by per capita income|List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska}}\n[[File:Anchorage1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], Alaska's largest city]]\n[[File:Fairbanks05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], Alaska's second-largest city and by a significant margin the largest city in [[Alaska Interior|Alaska's interior]]]]\n[[File:Downtown Juneau with Mount Juneau rising in the background.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Juneau]], Alaska's third-largest city and [[List of capitals in the United States|its capital]]]]\n[[File:Bethel Alaska aerial view.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], the largest city in the [[Unorganized Borough]] and in [[The Bush (Alaska)|rural Alaska]]]]\n[[File:Looking into the sun from over downtown onto the Homer Spit..jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Homer, Alaska|Homer]], showing (from bottom to top) the edge of downtown, [[Homer Airport|its airport]] and [[Homer Spit|the Spit]]]]\n[[File:Barrow-Alaska-skyview.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]] (Browerville neighborhood near [[Eben Hopson]] Middle School shown), known colloquially for many years by the nickname \"Top of the World\", is the northernmost city in the United States.]]\n[[File:CordovaHillside.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]], built in the early 20th century to support the [[Kennecott Mines]] and the [[Copper River and Northwestern Railway]], has persevered as a fishing community since their closure.]]\n[[File:Downtown Talkeetna.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Main Street in [[Talkeetna]]]]\n\nAlaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.countystate.info/alaska.htm| title=Alaska Boroughs\u2014\"Official\" sites| publisher=CountyState.Info| accessdate=September 13, 2007| website=Official Borough Websites| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027120825/http://www.countystate.info/Alaska.htm| archive-date=October 27, 2007| url-status=live}}</ref> Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].\n\nThe Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization\u2014state/county/township\u2014most of Alaska uses only two tiers\u2014state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dixon|first=Mim|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=35SwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44&lpg=PT44&dq=Fairbanks+has+a+separate+borough+(the+Fairbanks+North+Star+Borough)+and+municipality+(the+City+of+Fairbanks)&source=bl&ots=BCgI8dcgDn&sig=ACfU3U0hPQLgZ3797_mEAj69IywLKbkzkw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO5OG1o4boAhWEZxUIHRZABzMQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Fairbanks%20has%20a%20separate%20borough%20(the%20Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough)%20and%20municipality%20(the%20City%20of%20Fairbanks)&f=false|title=What Happened To Fairbanks?: The Effects Of The Trans-alaska Oil Pipeline On The Community Of Fairbanks, Alaska|date=September 18, 2019|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-01076-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian.

The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]\" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\nOf Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made\". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B.

''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star.

A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.\n\nAnother {{convert|44|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971. [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.\n\nVarious private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.

After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.\n[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814]]\n\nBetween 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.\n\n[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.\n\nOn March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2&nbsp;million. It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at \"Castle Hill\". Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.\n\n[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.\n\n[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\nFor most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.

Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year.

The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska\u2014Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n\n{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\n\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides.

Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.\n\n===Energy===\n\n{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}\n[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].

The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\n\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans.

Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth\u2014USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heavy-lift_melon.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right)\n}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs.

The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.

In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less.

It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.)

[[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and [[Fairbanks International Airport|Fairbanks]] to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.\n[[File:ERA Aviation prop plane landing at ANC (6194226738).jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier Dash 8]], operated by [[Era Alaska]], on approach to [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]]]\n\nThe bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Ravn Alaska]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.\n\nMany communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.<ref>\nOut of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 were pilots, or about one in 78, Federal Aviation Administration.

In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a {{convert|1150|mi|adj=on}} trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=out}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige.

The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.\n\nRepublican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State representative [[Lisa Murkowski]], as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004, 2010 and 2016.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"160\" heights=\"160\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Alaska's current statewide elected officials\">\nFile:Mike Dunleavy official photo (cropped).jpg|[[Mike Dunleavy (politician)|Mike Dunleavy]], [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]]\nFile:Lisa Murkowski official photo (cropped).jpg|[[Lisa Murkowski]], senior [[List of United States Senators from Alaska|United States Senator]]\nFile:Senator Dan Sullivan official.jpg|[[Dan Sullivan (U.S. senator)|Dan Sullivan]], junior United States Senator\nFile:Don Young, official 115th Congress photo portrait (cropped).jpg|[[Don Young]], [[List of United States Representatives from Alaska|United States Representative]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Cities, towns and boroughs==\n\n{{See also|List of cities in Alaska by population|Alaska locations by per capita income|List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska}}\n[[File:Anchorage1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], Alaska's largest city]]\n[[File:Fairbanks05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], Alaska's second-largest city and by a significant margin the largest city in [[Alaska Interior|Alaska's interior]]]]\n[[File:Downtown Juneau with Mount Juneau rising in the background.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Juneau]], Alaska's third-largest city and [[List of capitals in the United States|its capital]]]]\n[[File:Bethel Alaska aerial view.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], the largest city in the [[Unorganized Borough]] and in [[The Bush (Alaska)|rural Alaska]]]]\n[[File:Looking into the sun from over downtown onto the Homer Spit..jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Homer, Alaska|Homer]], showing (from bottom to top) the edge of downtown, [[Homer Airport|its airport]] and [[Homer Spit|the Spit]]]]\n[[File:Barrow-Alaska-skyview.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]] (Browerville neighborhood near [[Eben Hopson]] Middle School shown), known colloquially for many years by the nickname \"Top of the World\", is the northernmost city in the United States.]]\n[[File:CordovaHillside.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]], built in the early 20th century to support the [[Kennecott Mines]] and the [[Copper River and Northwestern Railway]], has persevered as a fishing community since their closure.]]\n[[File:Downtown Talkeetna.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Main Street in [[Talkeetna]]]]\n\nAlaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.countystate.info/alaska.htm| title=Alaska Boroughs\u2014\"Official\" sites| publisher=CountyState.Info| accessdate=September 13, 2007| website=Official Borough Websites| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027120825/http://www.countystate.info/Alaska.htm| archive-date=October 27, 2007| url-status=live}}</ref> Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].\n\nThe Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization\u2014state/county/township\u2014most of Alaska uses only two tiers\u2014state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dixon|first=Mim|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=35SwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44&lpg=PT44&dq=Fairbanks+has+a+separate+borough+(the+Fairbanks+North+Star+Borough)+and+municipality+(the+City+of+Fairbanks)&source=bl&ots=BCgI8dcgDn&sig=ACfU3U0hPQLgZ3797_mEAj69IywLKbkzkw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO5OG1o4boAhWEZxUIHRZABzMQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Fairbanks%20has%20a%20separate%20borough%20(the%20Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough)%20and%20municipality%20(the%20City%20of%20Fairbanks)&f=false|title=What Happened To Fairbanks?: The Effects Of The Trans-alaska Oil Pipeline On The Community Of Fairbanks, Alaska|date=September 18, 2019|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-01076-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian.

The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]\" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\nOf Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.\n\nThe official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is \"[[Alaska's Flag]]\", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].\n\n===Alaska in film and on television===\n\n{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}\n[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]\n\nAlaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made\". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.\n\nWhen ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.\n\nThe 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]].

The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.\n\nMany films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]].

Altogether, he won 63 doubles titles, surpassed only by [[the Bryan brothers]], [[Todd Woodbridge]], [[John McEnroe]] and [[Tom Okker]]. He was also ranked No.1 in Doubles on the ATP Computer for a significant period from 1977 to 1979 when he was aged 37.\n\n== Biography ==\nMcMillan was born in [[Springs, South Africa]].  Aside from his considerable success as a doubles player, he had a singles career with good results mostly in South Africa.\n\nHe played in 38 Grand Slam singles events with a 28 to 38 win/loss record, first playing in 1961 at Wimbledon and last at the first US Open at Flushing Meadows in 1978. His best results in both came at the US Open reaching the quarter finals in 1972 and the last 16 in 1976. Arguably his greatest result was reaching the final of the [[1970 South African Open (tennis)|1970 South African Open]] held at Ellis Park. He beat a raging [[Pancho Gonzales]] in the semi-final before losing to world no.1 [[Rod Laver]] in four sets in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Routs Foe, Wins Tennis Title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RudHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nf8MAAAAIBAJ&dq=laver%20mcmillan%20tennis&pg=3831%2C4732794|work=The Morning Record|date=4 April 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Captures So.

As late as 1979 McMillan reached the quarter-finals of the [[Fischer Open]] in Vienna.\n\nMcMillan continued to play the tour for many years. In doubles, he played his last Wimbledon with [[Bob Hewitt]] in 1979 reaching the semi-finals. They made a last appearance together in the main draw at Flushing Meadows in 1980 reaching the quarter-finals with a nostalgic victory over fellow veteran Americans [[Clark Graebner]] and [[Charlie Pasarell]]. McMillan won his last tour title at the 1982 South African Open with [[Brian Gottfried]].\n\nMcMillan played for many years on the seniors tours and was runner-up at the inaugural \"Wimbledon over 35's\" to [[John Newcombe]] in 1982 after good wins against [[Tony Roche]], [[Mark Cox (tennis)|Mark Cox]] and [[Ismail El Shafei]]. In 1988 he and Hewitt, older by 20 years between them, beat the Gullikson twins Tim and Tom in the 35's doubles final at Wimbledon.\n\nThe most notable aspect of his game was that he had both a two-handed backhand and forehand, which increased his power while restricting his mobility.  In the 1967 Wimbledon, he and Hewitt did not lose a set, and McMillan did not once lose a service game.\n\nMcMillan was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, in 1992. He now works as a tennis commentator for [[Eurosport]] and on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC Radio 5]] during [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].\n\n== Grand Prix Championship Series singles finals

championships including three [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]s with [[Bob Hewitt]]. Altogether, he won 63 doubles titles, surpassed only by [[the Bryan brothers]], [[Todd Woodbridge]], [[John McEnroe]] and [[Tom Okker]]. He was also ranked No.1 in Doubles on the ATP Computer for a significant period from 1977 to 1979 when he was aged 37.\n\n== Biography ==\nMcMillan was born in [[Springs, South Africa]].  Aside from his considerable success as a doubles player, he had a singles career with good results mostly in South Africa.\n\nHe played in 38 Grand Slam singles events with a 28 to 38 win/loss record, first playing in 1961 at Wimbledon and last at the first US Open at Flushing Meadows in 1978. His best results in both came at the US Open reaching the quarter finals in 1972 and the last 16 in 1976. Arguably his greatest result was reaching the final of the [[1970 South African Open (tennis)|1970 South African Open]] held at Ellis Park. He beat a raging [[Pancho Gonzales]] in the semi-final before losing to world no.1 [[Rod Laver]] in four sets in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Routs Foe, Wins Tennis Title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RudHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nf8MAAAAIBAJ&dq=laver%20mcmillan%20tennis&pg=3831%2C4732794|work=The Morning Record|date=4 April 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Laver Captures So.

As late as 1979 McMillan reached the quarter-finals of the [[Fischer Open]] in Vienna.\n\nMcMillan continued to play the tour for many years. In doubles, he played his last Wimbledon with [[Bob Hewitt]] in 1979 reaching the semi-finals. They made a last appearance together in the main draw at Flushing Meadows in 1980 reaching the quarter-finals with a nostalgic victory over fellow veteran Americans [[Clark Graebner]] and [[Charlie Pasarell]]. McMillan won his last tour title at the 1982 South African Open with [[Brian Gottfried]].\n\nMcMillan played for many years on the seniors tours and was runner-up at the inaugural \"Wimbledon over 35's\" to [[John Newcombe]] in 1982 after good wins against [[Tony Roche]], [[Mark Cox (tennis)|Mark Cox]] and [[Ismail El Shafei]]. In 1988 he and Hewitt, older by 20 years between them, beat the Gullikson twins Tim and Tom in the 35's doubles final at Wimbledon.\n\nThe most notable aspect of his game was that he had both a two-handed backhand and forehand, which increased his power while restricting his mobility.  In the 1967 Wimbledon, he and Hewitt did not lose a set, and McMillan did not once lose a service game.\n\nMcMillan was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, in 1992. He now works as a tennis commentator for [[Eurosport]] and on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|BBC Radio 5]] during [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].\n\n== Grand Prix Championship Series singles finals

A generation later, Panjabi's parents migrated to West Africa, where Panjabi was born and raised in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. After [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war broke out in Liberia in 1989]], Panjabi, at age nine, and his family fled on a rescue cargo plane to [[Sierra Leone]] and eventually sought asylum in the United States, resettling initially with a host family in High Point, [[North Carolina]].\n\nPanjabi graduated with bachelor and medical degrees from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina School at Chapel Hill]] and received a Masters of Public Health from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]. He was a Clinical Fellow at Harvard Medical School, and trained in [[internal medicine]] and [[primary care]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].\n\nPanjabi returned to Liberia in 2005, as a medical student.\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== Last Mile Health ===\n\nPanjabi is best known as the co-founder and CEO of Last Mile Health,<ref> https://lastmilehealth.org/ </ref> a non-profit organisation working to save lives in the world's most remote communities. He co-founded this organisation in 2007 with a small team of Liberian civil war survivors and American health workers and $6,000 he had received as a wedding gift.\n\nLast Mile Health's mission is to save lives in the world's most remote communities. Through effective country programs and global initiatives, Last Mile Health partners with governments to support teams of community and frontline health workers who bring high-quality primary healthcare within reach of millions of rural people.<ref>https://lastmilehealth.org/four-year-strategic-plan/ </ref> Community Health Workers [CHWs] are people with a middle or high school level education who are employed in their own villages and given training, medicines and smartphones enabling them to bring health care to the doorsteps of their neighbors. When a patient has a condition CHWs can\u2019t care for, they work with frontline health workers, including outreach nurses and midwives, to refer patients to networks of clinics and hospitals.<ref name=\"time.com\"> Panjabi R.

The workers in this program carry out nearly 1/3 of all confirmed malaria diagnoses in the country, have identified over 4,000 potential epidemic events, improved vaccination coverage, improved skill birth attendance, and increased the rate of children receiving medical care by over 50% in Liberia's most remote communities.<ref>https://time.com/5709344/governments-should-pay-community-health-workers/</ref> As of 2019, through service, research and advocacy efforts, Last Mile Health has supported local partners working to strengthen rural frontline and community health workforces in nearly 10 countries across three continents.<ref> 2019-annual-report.lastmilehealth.org </ref>\n\nIn 2017, Panjabi and Last Mile Health received the $1 million TED Prize to launch the Community Health Academy, a global platform leveraging the power of digital technology to support countries to modernize the training of community health workers and health systems leaders.<ref name=\"ted.com\">https://www.ted.com/talks/raj_panjabi_no_one_should_die_because_they_live_too_far_from_a_doctor</ref> In collaboration with several partners and governments, the Community Health Academy has launched online and mobile courses for frontline health leaders and workers seeking to strengthen primary health care at the community level. The Academy's first leadership course, Strengthening Community Health Worker Programs to Deliver Primary Health Care,<ref>Strengthening Community Health Worker Programs http://HarvardX.link/chws</ref>\n co-produced with edX and HarvardX, has enrolled over 10,000 learners from 180 countries.<ref>Community Health Academy http://www.communityhealthacademy.org</ref>\n\nPanjabi has worked on rural community-based primary health care systems in Alaska, Liberia, and Afghanistan.

The study indicated that, in one of Liberia's most remote districts, professionalized CHWs coached by nurses significantly improved access to care from qualified providers for children suffering from [[diarrhea]], [[malaria]], and [[acute respiratory infection]] \u2013 increasing by 60.1, 30.6 and 51.2 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider to 84.0 percent. In addition, despite the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus disease outbreak]], which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for [[fever]], acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:<blockquote>practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County. Furthermore, several of the programme's features, such as contracts and cash payments, ensuring a CHW-to-population ratio of 1:350, targeting of services to remote communities and field-based supervision, have helped to inform the design of Liberia's National Community Health Assistant Program.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>An editorial on barriers to universal health coverage co-authored by [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], cited the 2017 study about Last Mile Health's work in Liberia.

A generation later, Panjabi's parents migrated to West Africa, where Panjabi was born and raised in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. After [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war broke out in Liberia in 1989]], Panjabi, at age nine, and his family fled on a rescue cargo plane to [[Sierra Leone]] and eventually sought asylum in the United States, resettling initially with a host family in High Point, [[North Carolina]].\n\nPanjabi graduated with bachelor and medical degrees from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina School at Chapel Hill]] and received a Masters of Public Health from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]. He was a Clinical Fellow at Harvard Medical School, and trained in [[internal medicine]] and [[primary care]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].\n\nPanjabi returned to Liberia in 2005, as a medical student.\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== Last Mile Health ===\n\nPanjabi is best known as the co-founder and CEO of Last Mile Health <ref> https://lastmilehealth.org/ </ref>, a non-profit organisation working to save lives in the world's most remote communities. He co-founded this organisation in 2007 with a small team of Liberian civil war survivors and American health workers and $6,000 he had received as a wedding gift.\n\nLast Mile Health's mission is to save lives in the world's most remote communities. Through effective country programs and global initiatives, Last Mile Health partners with governments to support teams of community and frontline health workers who bring high-quality primary healthcare within reach of millions of rural people <ref> https://lastmilehealth.org/four-year-strategic-plan/ </ref>. Community Health Workers [CHWs] are people with a middle or high school level education who are employed in their own villages and given training, medicines and smartphones enabling them to bring health care to the doorsteps of their neighbors. When a patient has a condition CHWs can\u2019t care for, they work with frontline health workers, including outreach nurses and midwives, to refer patients to networks of clinics and hospitals <ref name=\"time.com\"> Panjabi R. Community Health Workers Are Vital. Governments Should Be Paying Them. https://time.com/5709344/governments-should-pay-community-health-workers/ TIME. October 24, 2019 </ref>. \n\nFollowing the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|2013-16 West Africa Ebola epidemic]], Last Mile Health partnered with the Government of Liberia and other organizations to design and scale a National Community Health Assistant Program, which aims to train, equip, and pay over 4000 CHWs, as well as 400 [[Nursing|nurses]], [[physician assistant]]s, and [[Midwife|midwives]] to supervise them. The workers in this program carry out nearly 1/3 of all confirmed malaria diagnoses in the country, have identified over 4,000 potential epidemic events, improved vaccination coverage, improved skill birth attendance, and increased the rate of children receiving medical care by over 50% in Liberia's most remote communities. <ref>https://time.com/5709344/governments-should-pay-community-health-workers/</ref> As of 2019, through service, research and advocacy efforts, Last Mile Health has supported local partners working to strengthen rural frontline and community health workforces in nearly 10 countries across three continents <ref> 2019-annual-report.lastmilehealth.org </ref>\n\nIn 2017, Panjabi and Last Mile Health received the $1 million TED Prize to launch the Community Health Academy, a global platform leveraging the power of digital technology to support countries to modernize the training of community health workers and health systems leaders. <ref name=\"ted.com\">https://www.ted.com/talks/raj_panjabi_no_one_should_die_because_they_live_too_far_from_a_doctor</ref> In collaboration with several partners and governments, the Community Health Academy has launched online and mobile courses for frontline health leaders and workers seeking to strengthen primary health care at the community level. The Academy's first leadership course, Strengthening Community Health Worker Programs to Deliver Primary Health Care <ref>Strengthening Community Health Worker Programs http://HarvardX.link/chws</ref>\n, co-produced with edX and HarvardX, has enrolled over 10,000 learners from 180 countries. <ref>Community Health Academy http://www.communityhealthacademy.org</ref>\n\nPanjabi has worked on rural community-based primary health care systems in Alaska, Liberia, and Afghanistan. He is a Gavi Champion, member of the International Advisory Group for Frontlines First at the Global Financing Facility of the World Bank Group, advisor to the Community Health Roadmap, and a member of the Community Health Worker Hub at the World Health Organization [WHO], where he served on the External Review Group for the WHO's guidelines on health policy and system support to optimize community health worker programs.\n\nPanjabi has served on the boards of Echoing Green <ref> http://www.echoinggreen.org </ref>, the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Presidential Center for Women and Development <ref> http://ejspresidentialcenter.org/index.php/purpose/ </ref> and Doctors for America <ref> http://drsforamerica.org </ref>.\n\n\n\n=== Research ===\nPanjabi has authored or co-authored over 50 publications.<ref>Rajesh Ramesh Panjabi, M.D. Harvard Catalyst Profile https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/31205</ref>  He has chaired a global study investigating lessons learned from exemplar community-based health care programs.

The study indicated that, in one of Liberia's most remote districts, professionalized CHWs coached by nurses significantly improved access to care from qualified providers for children suffering from [[diarrhea]], [[malaria]], and [[acute respiratory infection]] \u2013 increasing by 60.1, 30.6 and 51.2 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider to 84.0 percent. In addition, despite the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus disease outbreak]], which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for [[fever]], acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:<blockquote>practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County. Furthermore, several of the programme's features, such as contracts and cash payments, ensuring a CHW-to-population ratio of 1:350, targeting of services to remote communities and field-based supervision, have helped to inform the design of Liberia's National Community Health Assistant Program.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>An editorial on barriers to universal health coverage co-authored by [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], cited the 2017 study about Last Mile Health's work in Liberia.

During the 1970s he created the foundation of the LaRouche Movement and became more engaged in conspiratorial beliefs and violent and/or illegal activities. In 1986, his movement reached its height in electoral success when Larouchite candidates won several Democratic primaries for state offices in Illinois. (The defeated mainstream Democratic candidates ran in the general election as members of the [[Illinois Solidarity Party]]; the Larouchite Democrats all finished a distant third.) Later in the 1980s, criminal investigations led to convictions of several LaRouche movement members, including LaRouche himself. He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, but only served five years.\n\nLaRouche was a perennial candidate for [[President of the United States]]. He ran in every election from 1976 to 2004 as a candidate of third parties established by members of his movement. He also tried to gain the Democratic presidential nomination.

LaRouche's view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that [[HIV]] caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect bites\u2014which, if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche's views on AIDS were developed by [[John R.

Johnson characterizes LaRouche's views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. LaRouche believed that many of the world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the [[Empiricism#British empiricism|empirical philosophers]] (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], embraces [[moral relativism]], and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argued, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new Dark Age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]], [[Teamsters]], and pro-life advocates.\n\nIn ''Architects of Fear'' (1983), Johnson compares LaRouche's view to an [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati conspiracy theory]]; Johnson writes that after he wrote about LaRouche in ''[[The Minneapolis Star]]'', LaRouche's followers denounced him as part of a conspiracy of elitists that began in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Johnson-1983-pp187ff\"/><ref name=Johnson2>{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=314ff.}}</ref><ref>For LaRouche on his philosophy, see LaRouche, Lyndon.

During the 1970s he created the foundation of the LaRouche Movement and became more engaged in conspiratorial beliefs and violent and/or illegal activities. In 1986, his movement reached its height in electoral success when Larouchite candidates won several Democratic primaries for state offices in Illinois. (The defeated mainstream Democratic candidates ran in the general election as members of the [[Illinois Solidarity Party]]; the Larouchite Democrats all finished a distant third.) Later in the 1980s, criminal investigations led to convictions of several LaRouche movement members, including LaRouche himself. He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, but only served five years.\n\nLaRouche was a perennial candidate for [[President of the United States]]. He ran in every election from 1976 to 2004 as a candidate of third parties established by members of his movement. He also tried to gain the Democratic presidential nomination. In 1996, he got 5% of the total nationwide vote in Democratic primaries. In 2000, he received enough primary votes to qualify for delegates in some states, but ultimately was refused those delegates at the convention.\n\n==Early life==\nLaRouche was born in Rochester, New Hampshire, the oldest of three children of Jessie Lenore ({{nee}} Weir) and Lyndon H.

LaRouche's view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that [[HIV]] caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect bites\u2014which, if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche's views on AIDS were developed by [[John R.

Johnson characterizes LaRouche's views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. LaRouche believed that many of the world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the [[Empiricism#British empiricism|empirical philosophers]] (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], embraces [[moral relativism]], and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argued, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new Dark Age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]], [[Teamsters]], and pro-life advocates.\n\nIn ''Architects of Fear'' (1983), Johnson compares LaRouche's view to an [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati conspiracy theory]]; Johnson writes that after he wrote about LaRouche in ''[[The Minneapolis Star]]'', LaRouche's followers denounced him as part of a conspiracy of elitists that began in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Johnson-1983-pp187ff\"/><ref name=Johnson2>{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=314ff.}}</ref><ref>For LaRouche on his philosophy, see LaRouche, Lyndon.
