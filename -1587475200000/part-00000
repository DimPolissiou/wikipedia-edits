She was married to Samrat Singh Rathore ([[Mohit Malik]]), an arrogant, male chauvinist, and abusive husband. As the story progresses, Urmi and Samrat have a child, Shaurya. Urmi suffers a lot with Samrat. Later, Urmi walks out of her marriage due to Samrat's infidelity, becomes successful and independent, and divorces Samrat. Samrat, on the other hand, is imprisoned.          \n\n===6 Years Later===                   \nIshaan  Sinha ([[Siddharth Arora]]/[[Vibhav Roy]]), who has been Samrat's best friend, confidant, and lawyer, falls in love with Urmi and they get married.

Diya ([[Neha Sargam]]) works with Shaurya in the same agency. On a work assignment, Diya is [[raped]]. The story henceforth focuses on Shaurya and Diya and how Shaurya helps Diya stand up for herself, fights for her, supports her, and eventually falls in love with her. Diya on her part fights for her rights, lives her life with her head held high and also eventually falls in love with Shaurya and marries. \n\nLater Urmi reunites with her daughter Ishaani and the latter apologizes for the misunderstanding which she had. Damiani Sinha  is killed by Urmi as she was trying to kill Shaurya and Ishaani and pays for her evil deeds thus making a happy ending for the show Doli Armaanon Ki.\n\n== Cast ==\n'''Main Cast'''\n*[[Neha Marda]] as Urmi Samrat Singh Rathore/ Urmi Ishaan Sinha / Urmi Devi Singh\n*[[Mohit Malik]] as Samrat Singh Rathore\n\n*'''Recurring Cast'''\n*[[Siddharth Arora]] / [[Vibhav Roy]] as Ishaan Anirudh Sinha (Samrat's former friend, Urmi's second husband)\n* Parvati Sehgal as Tani Singh Rathore / Tani Sinha, (Samrat second's wife)\n*[[Avinash Wadhawan]] as Anirudh Sinha\n*[[ Kamya Panjabi]] as Damini Anirudh Sinha\n*[[Vishal Puri]] as Niranjan Khanna (Samrat's lawyer)\n*Ayesha Singh as Ratti Sinha\n*Shashwita Sharma as Sandhiya Sinha\n*[[Geeta Tyagi]] as Shashikala  Singh Rathore\n*Hemant Thatte as Gaurav Devi Singh\n*[[Anjali Mukhi]] as Saroj Devi Singh\n*Sameeksha Sud as Asha Gaurav Singh\n*Jayant Rawal as Devi Singh\n*Mitansh Gera as Shaurya Samrat Singh Rathore (Samrat and Urmi's son, Ishaan's adoptive  son)\n*[[Shruti Kanwar]] as Radha, Kanchan's sister\n*[[Vikram Chatterjee]] as Yash Singhania\n*Gaurav Rana as Diwakar Singh Rathore\n*Vibhuti Thakur as Kanchan Diwakar Singh Rathore\n*Jetendra as Rudra Singh Rathore\n*[[Anupam Shyam]] as Garjan Singh Rathore aka \"Tauji\" \n*Amita Udgata as Gayatri Singh\n*[[Guddi Maruti]] as Bua\n*Snigdha Srivastava as Trisha Singh (Urmi's cousin)\n*Manisha Thakkar as Rashmi Singh Rathore /Rashmi Gaurav Singh (Samrat's cousin)\n*[[Varun Sharma (TV actor)|Varun Sharma]] as Karan (Anushka's former fianc\u00e9)\n*Mehendi Jain as Anushka <nowiki>''Anu''</nowiki> Devi Singh\n*Deepali Saini as Meena (Urmi's hostel friend)\n*[[Aadesh Chaudhary]] / [[Harsh Vashisht]] as Amrit Singh Chauhan\n*Ragini Gakhar as Aditi Amrit Singh Chauhan / Aditi Rudra Singh Rathore\n*Krishnam Sharma as Rahul\n*Karan Mishra as Deepak\n*Ayush Mehra as Ravi Darshan Tiwari\n*[[Swati Nanda]] as Sanaya Seth (Urmi's Mumbai friend, Samrat's former lover)\n*Mohit Shrivastava as Prathanesh Sharma\n*[[Himani Shivpuri]] as Sushma Tiwari\n*[[Raju Kher]] as Darshan Tiwari\n*[[Keith Sequeira]] as James (blackmailer)\n*[[Neetha Shetty]] as Kiran, Samrat's love interest\n*[[Kunal Jaisingh]]/Shashank Sethi as Chiku Gaurav Singh (Asha and Gaurav's son)\n*[[Manasi Salvi]] as Urmi Ishaan Sinha \n*[[Kunal Karan Kapoor]] as Shaurya Samrat Singh Rathore\n*[[Neha Sargam]] as Diya Shaurya Singh Rathore\n*Kapil Arya as Karan\n*[[Gaurav Chopra]] as Akash Kumar\n*Pallavi Dutt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/sunayana-fozdar-and-pallavi-dutt-enter-zee-tvs-doli-armaanon-ki-150831|title=Sunayana Fozdar and Pallavi Dutt to enter Zee TV's Doli Armaanon Ki|first=Tellychakkar|last=Team|website=Tellychakkar.com}}</ref>\n*[[Nalini Negi]] as Ishaani Sinha (Urmi and Ishaan's daughter, Samrat's Sept - daughter)\n*Mohit Shrivastava as Prathanesh Sharma\n*Shahab Khan as Diya's father\n\n\n==Production==\n[[Rahil Azam]] was signed for the show but eventually got replaced by [[Mohit Malik]].\n\n[[Chhavi Pandey]] auditioned for Parvati Sehgal's role but got rejected by the makers.\n\n[[Karan Tacker]] was approached for Ishaan's role before finalizing [[Vibhav Roy ]] in it but Karan rejected the role because of some personal issues.\n\n[[Nikita Sharma]] was offered a role in the show which was earlier played by Priya Shinde in the show.\n\n[[Falaq Naaz]] was chosen for playing the elder Anushka in the show after the 5 year leap replacing Mehendi Jain as the younger one which was a strong character of an IPS Officer in the show but the makers scrapped her role because of too much characters in the five year leap.\n\n[[Mohit Malik]] was to play the role of adult Shaurya after leap but he quit the show because of Jhalak Dikhla Jaa.\n\n[[Saurabh Raaj Jain]] was offered Shaurya's role which was later played by [[Kunal Karan Kapoor]] in the show.\n\n[[Kanchi Singh]] was offered Nalini Negi's role but declined it as she thought it was a negative character.\n\n[[Rajat Tokas]] was approached for the show but declined the part [[ Gaurav Chopra ]] played the part later.\n\n== International broadcast ==\nIn [[Pakistan]], the serial aired on [[Geo kahani]].

Defection by legislators is faced by many other political democracies around the world. Such acts by legislators invite political instability by way of abandonment of one's parent party for various reasons. In most of the democracies, the stability of the government is dependent on the support from Legislators or a coalition of different parties. Such acts of political defection resulting in instability of the sitting government is looked at, as a betrayal of ''Peoples Mandate''. Many countries have adopted different means to tackle the menace of political defections, some through conventions and other by way of Laws. In India, there were several instances, when political instability was inflicted on the people of India, both at the center and states because of political defection by various legislators by splitting the political parties. It was estimated during fourth and fifth general elections, out of 4000 legislators for the parliament and other state and union territories, almost 50 percent of the members defected causing political turmoil in India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh Kumar|first=|date=May 2003|title=Anti-defection Law: Welcome Reforms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413541?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=Vol.38 No.19|pages=1837|via=JSTOR}}</ref> There rose a need to this malice of political defections. It was in the backdrop of such regular precedents, a law was sought to curb defections by legislators. In 1985, by way of introducing '''''Tenth schedule'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S10.pdf|title=Tenth Schedule|last=|first=|date=1985|website=Govt. of India|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in the 52nd amendment to the [[Constitution of India]], both [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]] passed The Anti-defection law. Further, to address various lacunae in the said act, many constitutional bodies recommended reviewing the law. [[Parliament of India]], in 2003 passed Ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India strengthening the act by inserting provisions to disqualify the defecting members and barring them to be appointed as ministers for the period of up to the original tenure and disqualifying members defecting from splits caused by one-third of members moving out of a political party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malhotra|first=G C.|title=Anti-defection Law in India and The Commonwealth|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=Forword}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\u201cGovernment is of the people by the people and for the people\", this is how [[Abraham Lincoln]] defined the Democracy. Elections in a democratic country are an important aspect where people cast their ballot and determine which political party shall govern the country or a state.

But ever since 1960, especially, the states added a new facet to the political instability in the country resulting from coalition politics in India. The term ''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram'', was popularized when in 1967, a legislator by name [[Gaya Lal]] changed his allegiance to three different parties in a single day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/anti-defection-law-explained|title=The Anti-Defection Law Explained|last=Relhan|first=Vibhor|date=December 2017|website=PRS Legislative Research|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1957 and 67, it is estimated that, because of a stronghold over power by [[Indian National Congress|Congress (I)]] party, it emerged as a sole beneficiary of the defections by losing 98 of its legislators and gaining 419. However, defections from non-Congress parties did not join any other political parties, instead they formed a separate political party intending to share power.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kashyap|first=Subhash|date=March 1970|title=The Politics of Defection: The Changing Contours of the Political Power Structure in State Politics in India|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642574?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Asian Survey|volume=Vol.10 No.3|pages=197|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In 1967 elections, approximately 3,500 members were elected to various legislative assemblies and of union territories of them around 550 changed their parent parties by defections.

There was a definite trend in the political landscape of India during the 1970-80s. Whenever there was a Congress-led Government at the center, the regional governments fell like a pack of cards because of the defection of non-Congress elected representatives. The then chief minister of [[Karnataka]], [[Virendra Patil]] called it as \"Goldrush\".

However, experts believed such defections should not be viewed in terms of numbers alone and should be seen in context as to how such defection damage the people's mandate.

The Committee noted that the provision of ''Split'' from paragraph three in the 1985 act was being grossly exploited, causing multiple divisions in various political parties.

It was estimated during fourth and fifth general elections, out of 4000 legislators for the parliament and other state and union territories, almost 50 percent of the members defected causing political turmoil in India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh Kumar|first=|date=May 2003|title=Anti-defection Law: Welcome Reforms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413541?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=Vol.38 No.19|pages=1837|via=JSTOR}}</ref> There rose a need to this malice of political defections.

Further, to address various lacunae in the said act, many constitutional bodies recommended reviewing the law. [[Parliament of India]], in 2003 passed Ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India strengthening the act by inserting provisions to disqualify the defecting members and barring them to be appointed as ministers for the period of up to the original tenure and disqualifying members defecting from splits caused by one-third of members moving out of a political party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malhotra|first=G C.|title=Anti-defection Law in India and The Commonwealth|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=Forword}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\u201cGovernment is of the people by the people and for the people\", this is how [[Abraham Lincoln]] defined the Democracy.

But ever since 1960, especially, the states added a new facet to the political instability in the country resulting from coalition politics in India.

{"title_page": "Army", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{army units}}\nAn '''army''' (from Latin ''arma'' \"arms, weapons\" via Old French ''arm\u00e9e'', \"armed\" [feminine]), '''ground force''' or '''land force''' is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based [[military branch]], service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national [[military]] force, the word army may also mean a [[field army]].\n\nIn some countries, such as France and China, the term \"army\", especially in its plural form \"armies\", has the broader meaning of [[armed forces]] as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called [[French Army|''Arm\u00e9e de terre'']], meaning '''Land Army''', and the air force is called [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']], meaning '''Air Army'''. The naval force, although not using the term \"army\", is also included in the broad sense of the term \"armies\" \u2014 thus the [[French Navy]] is an integral component of the collective French Armies ([[French Armed Forces]]) under the [[Ministry of the Armies (France)|Ministry of the Armies]]. A similar pattern is seen in China, with the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) being the overall military, the \"actual army\" being the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Ground Force]], and so forth for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLA Air Force]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA Navy]], and other branches.\n\nThe current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the PLA Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United States Army Center of Military History#Fellowships and publications|l1=United States Army Center of Military History \u00a7 Fellowships and publications}}\n\n===India===\nIndia's armies were among the first in the world.

After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60.

After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the [[Late Roman Empire]], these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were paid to serve as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\n===Medieval Europe===\n[[File:Belagerung von Calais 1346-1347.JPG|thumb|Armies of the Middle Ages consisted of noble knights, rendering service to their [[suzerain]], and hired footsoldiers]]\nIn\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries]] and German [[Landsknechts]] fighting for glory, fame and money at the [[Battle of Marignan]] (1515). The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel.

However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]\u2013[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97 97]|isbn=0-674-02385-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\nChina organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\nCanada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads.

A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general.\n\n===Formations===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[2nd Armored Division (United States)]] -->\n[[File:Army Nato.svg|thumb|Standard map symbol for a numbered Army, the 'X's are not substituting the army's number]]\n\nA particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Army aviation]]\n* [[World War I|First world war]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of armies by country]]\n* [[List of numbered armies]]\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Military history]]\n* [[Military organization]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Military]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n* [[Soldier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Army|army}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Military branches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armies| ]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{army units}}\nAn '''army''' (from Latin ''arma'' \"arms, weapons\" via Old French ''arm\u00e9e'', \"armed\" [feminine]), '''ground force''' or '''land force''' is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based [[military branch]], service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national [[military]] force, the word army may also mean a [[field army]].\n\nIn some countries, such as France and China, the term \"army\", especially in its plural form \"armies\", has the broader meaning of [[armed forces]] as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called [[French Army|''Arm\u00e9e de terre'']], meaning '''Land Army''', and the air force is called [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']], meaning '''Air Army'''. The naval force, although not using the term \"army\", is also included in the broad sense of the term \"armies\" \u2014 thus the [[French Navy]] is an integral component of the collective French Armies ([[French Armed Forces]]) under the [[Ministry of the Armies (France)|Ministry of the Armies]]. A similar pattern is seen in China, with the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) being the overall military, the \"actual army\" being the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|PLA Ground Force]], and so forth for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLA Air Force]], the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLA Navy]], and other branches.\n\nThe current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the PLA Ground Force of China with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 [[Military reserve force|reserve personnel]] followed by the [[Indian Army]] with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, [[irregular military]] is understood in contrast to [[regular army|regular armies]] which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite [[militia]]. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status ([[standing army]]), versus [[Military reserve force|reserve]] or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the [[National Defence Act]]), from de facto \"non-statutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] (designed for overseas or international deployment) or [[fencible]] (designed for \u2013 or restricted to \u2013 homeland defence)\n\n==History==\n{{for|the magazine ''Army History''|United States Army Center of Military History#Fellowships and publications|l1=United States Army Center of Military History \u00a7 Fellowships and publications}}\n\n===India===\nIndia's armies were among the first in the world.

After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan [[serf]]s or ''[[helot]]s'', did the manual labor.\n\nThis allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Spartan Army was largely composed of [[hoplite]]s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other.

This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.\n\nInitially, the words \"knight\" and \"noble\" were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them. While the nobility did fight upon horseback, they were also supported by lower class citizens \u2013 and mercenaries and criminals \u2013 whose only purpose was participating in warfare because, most often than not, they held brief employment during their lord's engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strong of Body, Brave and Noble: Chivalry and Society in Medieval France|last=Bouchard|first=Constance Brittain|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801430976|location=Ithaca|pages=13}}</ref> As the Middle Ages progressed and [[feudalism]] developed in a legitimate social and economic system, knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat: they were still in debt to their lord. No longer primarily driven by economic need, the newly established vassal class were, instead, driven by fealty and [[chivalry]].\n\nAs central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the [[peasantry]] began to be the central recruiting tool. England was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.\n\nIn theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Bob|title=Medieval Warfare|date=2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781781592243|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThus the [[scutage]] was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large [[mercenary]] market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.\n\nAs the Middle Ages progressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.\n\nIn 1439 the French legislature, known as the  [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] (French: ''\u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux''), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the ''[[taille]]'' that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as ''[[Compagnie d'ordonnance|compagnies d'ordonnance]]'' on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s,  eventually led to the [[Battle of Castillon|French victory at Castillon]] in 1453, and the conclusion of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the ''grande ordonnance'' and the garrison force known as the ''petite ordonnance''.<ref>Vale, M.G.A. (1992). ''Charles VII''.

The bulk of the [[Renaissance]] armies was composed of mercenaries.]]\n\nFirst [[nation state]]s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.\n\nThe [[veteran]] soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.\n\nAs late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.\n\nThe newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the [[Fronde]] in France and the [[English Civil War]].\n\nIn many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of [[absolute monarchy]]. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the [[Dutch Republic]]. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.\n\nHowever, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.\n\nAs any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The colonels of the [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises|French Guards]] and [[Grenadier Guards|British guard]]s politely discussing who should fire first at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] (1745).<ref>Mackinnon, Daniel. [https://archive.org/details/originandservic03mackgoog Origin and services of the Coldstream Guards], London 1883, Vol. 1, p. 368, note 2</ref> An example of \"lace war\".]]\n\nIt has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism, and during this period the modern notion of the [[nation state]] was born. However, this would only become apparent after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At this time, the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' and [[conscription]] would become the defining paradigm of [[modern warfare]].\n\nBefore then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, [[Wallonia]] ([[Walloon Guards]]) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from [[Piedmont]]. Britain recruited [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanovrian]] troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.\n\nPrior to the [[English Civil War]] in England, the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms]], or \"gentlemen pensioners\", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as [[Berwick on Tweed]] or [[Portsmouth]] (or [[Calais]] before it was [[Siege of Calais (1558)|recaptured]] by France in 1558).\n\nTroops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ''ad hoc'' basis. [[Noblemen]] and professional regular [[soldier]]s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by [[indenture]] from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the [[British Army]], although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. Then [[First American Regiment]] was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the [[Legion of the United States]], was established in 1791.\n\nUntil 1733 the common soldiers of [[Prussian Army]] consisted largely of [[peasantry]] recruited or impressed from [[Brandenburg]]\u2013[[Prussia]], leading many to flee to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600\u20131947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97 97]|isbn=0-674-02385-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironkingdomrised00chri/page/97}}</ref> To halt this trend, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] divided Prussia into [[Cantonist (Prussia)|regimental cantons]].

An early example of [[total war]]s.]]\n\n[[Russian tsar]]s before [[Peter the Great|Peter I of Russia]] maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps ([[streltsy]] in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a [[Imperial Russian Army|modern regular army]] built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from [[nobility]], as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers.<ref name=blum>Jerome Blum (1971) \"Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century\", {{ISBN|0-691-00764-0}}, pp. 465, 466</ref> The term of service in the 18th century was for life. In 1793 it was reduced to 25 years.

They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors (''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]s'') whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.\n\nFrom the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The \"recruits\" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of [[mamluk]]s.\n\nChina organized the [[Manchu people]] into the [[Eight Banner system]] in the early 17th century. Defected [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies formed the [[Green Standard Army]]. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.\n\n===Late modern===\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|Indian Army personnel during [[Operation Crusader]] in Egypt, 1941]]\n[[Conscription]] allowed the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to form the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which successfully battled European professional armies.\n\nConscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.\n\nCanada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.\n\nIn developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\nRussia, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare ''citizen army'' as used in Switzerland (see [[Military of Switzerland]]).\n\n==Armies as armed services==\nWestern armies are usually subdivided as follows:\n*'''[[Corps]]''': A corps usually consists of two or more divisions and is commanded by a [[lieutenant general]].\n*'''[[Division (military)|Division]]''': Each division is commanded by a [[major general]], and usually holds three brigades including infantry, artillery, engineers and communications units in addition to [[logistics]] (supply and service) support to sustain independent action. Except for the divisions operating in the mountains, divisions have at least one armored unit, some have even more depending upon their functionality. The basic building block of all ground force combat formations is the infantry division.\n*'''[[Brigade]]''': A brigade is under the command of a [[brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]] and sometimes is commanded by a [[colonel]]. It typically comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality. An independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit, an infantry unit, an armour unit and logistics to support its actions. Such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps.\n*'''[[Battalion]]''': Each battalion is commanded by a [[colonel]] or sometimes by [[lieutenant colonel]] who commands roughly 500 to 750 soldiers. This number varies depending on the functionality of the regiment. A battalion comprises 3\u20135 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] (3 rifle companies, a fire support company and headquarters company) or its functional equivalent such as batteries (artillery) or squadrons (armour and cavalry), each under the command of a [[major]]. The company can be divided into platoons, each of which can again be divided into sections or squads. (Terminology is nationality and even unit specific.)<ref name=\"definitions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |title=Subdivisions of the army |accessdate=2007-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116031246/http://www.fotw.net/flags/pk%5Eard.html |archivedate=2006-11-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Field army==\nA [[field army]] is composed of a headquarters, army [[troops]], a variable number of [[corps]], typically between three and four, and a variable number of [[Division (military)|divisions]], also between three and four. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a general or lieutenant general.\n\n===Formations===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[2nd Armored Division (United States)]] -->\n[[File:Army Nato.svg|thumb|Standard map symbol for a numbered Army, the 'X's are not substituting the army's number]]\n\nA particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the [[First United States Army]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. In the [[British Army]] it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).\n\nArmies (as well as [[army group]]s and [[Theater (military)|theater]]s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]], \"Armies\" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an [[Army Group]]-sized \"[[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]\" in wartime. In peacetime, a [[Army (Soviet Army)|Soviet army]] was usually subordinate to a [[military district]]. [[Viktor Suvorov]]'s ''Inside the Soviet Army'' describes how [[Cold War]] era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and [[Military deception|deception]] ('maskirovika') reasons.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Army aviation]]\n* [[World War I|First world war]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of armies by country]]\n* [[List of numbered armies]]\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Military history]]\n* [[Military organization]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Military]]\n* [[Paramilitary]]\n* [[Soldier]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Army|army}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Military branches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armies| ]]\n[[Category:Military]]\n", "name_user": "Stratosk2027", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMedieval Europe:i feel that it is too crowded)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army"}
