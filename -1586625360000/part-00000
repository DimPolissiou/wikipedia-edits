Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\".

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car.

Seely had built a friendship with Dottie West, who encouraged her to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. At first, Seely was hesitant about leaving southern California.

The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\".
