The county is located in the center of an imaginary triangle consisting of Indianapolis, IN, Cincinnati, OH,  and Louisville, KY and requires only 1{{fraction|1|4}} hour drive time to any of these urban centers.\n\nIt is also home to the [[Muscatatuck Urban Training Center]], located just outside North Vernon, at which various training exercises and scenarios are conducted for homeland security and other similar purposes.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Muscatatuck Urban Training Center\n  | work =\n  | publisher = United States Department of Defense\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.mutc.org/\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-05 }}</ref>\n<!-- This link is broken - (Source: [http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070509/LOCAL18/705090513/1195/LOCAL18 Indianapolis Star]) -->\n\n===City===\n* [[North Vernon, Indiana|North Vernon]]\n\n===Town===\n* [[Vernon, Indiana|Vernon]]\n\n===Census-designated places===\n* [[Butlerville, Indiana|Butlerville]]\n* [[Country Squire Lakes, Indiana|Country Squire Lakes]]\n* [[Hayden, Indiana|Hayden]]\n* [[Scipio, Indiana|Scipio]]\n\n===Other unincorporated places===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Brewersville, Indiana|Brewersville]]\n* [[Commiskey, Indiana|Commiskey]]\n* [[Four Corners, Indiana|Four Corners]]\n* [[Grayford, Indiana|Grayford]]\n* [[Hilltown, Indiana|Hilltown]]\n* [[Lovett, Indiana|Lovett]]\n* [[Nebraska, Indiana|Nebraska]]\n* [[Paris, Indiana|Paris]]\n* [[Paris Crossing, Indiana|Paris Crossing]]\n* [[Queensville, Indiana|Queensville]]\n* [[San Jacinto, Indiana|San Jacinto]]\n* [[Walnut Ridge, Indiana|Walnut Ridge]]\n* [[Zenas, Indiana|Zenas]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Townships===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bigger Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Bigger]]\n* [[Campbell Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Campbell]]\n* [[Center Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Center]]\n* [[Columbia Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Columbia]]\n* [[Geneva Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Geneva]]\n* [[Lovett Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Lovett]]\n* [[Marion Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Marion]]\n* [[Montgomery Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Montgomery]]\n* [[Sand Creek Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Sand Creek]]\n* [[Spencer Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Spencer]]\n* [[Vernon Township, Jennings County, Indiana|Vernon]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Decatur County, Indiana|Decatur County]]  (north)\n* [[Ripley County, Indiana|Ripley County]]  (east)\n* [[Jefferson County, Indiana|Jefferson County]]  (southeast)\n* [[Scott County, Indiana|Scott County]]  (south)\n* [[Jackson County, Indiana|Jackson County]] (west)\n* [[Bartholomew County, Indiana|Bartholomew County]] (northwest)\n\n===Major highways===\nSources:  National Atlas,<ref>[http://www.nationalatlas.gov/ National Atlas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205020547/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/ |date=2008-12-05 }}</ref> U.S. Census Bureau<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ |title=U.S. Census Bureau TIGER shape files |access-date=2017-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523020601/https://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/ |archive-date=2017-05-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Image:US 50.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 50 in Indiana|U.S. Route 50]]\n* [[Image:Indiana 3.svg|25px]] [[State Road 3 (Indiana)|State Road 3]]\n* [[Image:Indiana 7.svg|25px]] [[State Road 7 (Indiana)|State Road 7]]\n* [[Image:Indiana 250.svg|25px]] [[State Road 250 (Indiana)|State Road 250]]\n\n===Parks and protected areas===\n* [[Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n* [[Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n* [[Muscatatuck County Park]]\n* [[Selmier State Forest]]\n\n== Climate and weather ==\n{{climate chart\n|[[Vernon, Indiana]]\n|22|38|2.97\n|26|45|2.71\n|34|55|3.76\n|43|66|4.37\n|52|75|4.72\n|61|83|3.82\n|65|86|4.42\n|63|84|4.42\n|56|78|2.89\n|44|67|3.19\n|36|54|3.83\n|27|43|3.40\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIN0684\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Vernon, Indiana\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Vernon have ranged from a low of {{convert|22|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|86|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-24|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of {{convert|105|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

[[Volkswagen Motorsport]] and based on the [[Volkswagen Polo]] for use in the [[World Rally Championship]]. The car, which made its d\u00e9but at the start of the [[2013 World Rally Championship season|2013 season]], is built to the second generation of World Rally Car regulations that were introduced in 2011, which are based upon the existing [[Super 2000]] regulations, but powered by a turbocharged 1.6-litre engine rather than the normally aspirated 2-litre engine found in Super 2000 cars.\n\nThe Polo R WRC marks [[Volkswagen]]'s second entry into the World Rally Championship as a manufacturer. Volkswagen Motorsport had previously entered the [[Volkswagen Golf|Volkswagen Golf GTI]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|GTI 16V]] in rallies between [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983]] and [[1988 World Rally Championship season|1988]],<ref name=\"Klein 1\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Reinhardt|last1=Williams|first1=David|last2=Davenport|first2=John|last3=McMaster|first3=Colin|title=Rally Cars|year=2000|origyear=2000|publisher=K\u00f6nemann|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=3-8290-4625-1|page=420|chapter=Group A: 1987\u20131997}}</ref> while the company also made the [[Volkswagen Golf]] [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|Mk3]] and [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4]] available as a [[kit car]] to privateer entries during the [[Group A]] era from [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] to [[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]].<ref name=\"Klein 2\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Reinhardt|last1=Williams|first1=David|last2=Davenport|first2=John|last3=McMaster|first3=Colin|title=Rally Cars|year=2000|origyear=2000|publisher=K\u00f6nemann|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=3-8290-4625-1|page=529|chapter=Kit Cars}}</ref>\n\nThe car was extremely successful from its d\u00e9but, winning 43 of the 53 rallies that it entered, and scoring 37 more podiums.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

It is one of three high schools in the [[Ector County Independent School District]]. The full name of the school is '''Odessa Senior High School'''. This name was originally to differentiate it from Odessa Junior High School (now known as David Crockett Middle School). Normally, the school is commonly referred to as Odessa High or just OHS.   In 2011, the school was rated \"Academically Acceptable\" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2011/index.html \n |title=2011 Accountability Rating System \n |publisher=Texas Education Agency \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134123/http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2011/index.html \n |archivedate=2012-06-28 \n}}</ref> On April 17, 2014 Odessa High School was named an AVID National Demonstration School.\n\nThe student body of Odessa High School is composed of freshmen (grade 9) through seniors (grade 12).
