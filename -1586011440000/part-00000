Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]]. \n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams' Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n{{Jeremy Corbyn sidebar}}\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]]. \n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams' Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n{{Jeremy Corbyn sidebar}}\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work.

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right?

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]].

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right?

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]].

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognizable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built in a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. All three young can survive to fledging in years with plentiful food. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. It appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe Dutch naturalist [[Arnout Vosmaer]] described the secretarybird in 1769 based on a live specimen that had been sent to Holland from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] two years earlier by an official of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. Vosmaer suggested that the species was called \"Sagittarius\" because its gait was thought to resemble an archer's. He also mentioned that it was known as the \"Secretarius\" by farmers who had domesticated the bird to combat pests around their homesteads and proposed that the word \"Secretarius\" might be a corruption of \"Sagittarius\".<ref>{{ cite book | last=Vosmaer | first=Arnout | year=1769 | title=Description d'un oiseau de proie, nomm\u00e9 le sagittaire, tout-\u00e0-fait inconnu jusque'ici; apport\u00e9 du Cap de Bonne Esp\u00e9rance | language=French | location=Amsterdam | publisher=Pierre Meyer | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/51569536 }} Contains eight pages and a plate.</ref><ref>{{ cite book | last=Vosmaer | first=Arnout | year=1769 | title=Beschryving van eenen Afrikaanschen nog geheel onbekenden roof-vogel de Sagitarrius genaamd op de Kaap de Goede Hoop | language=Dutch | location=Amsterdam | publisher=Pierre Meyer | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/27738512 }} Contains eight pages and a plate.</ref>\n\nIn 1779 the English illustrator [[John Frederick Miller]] included a coloured plate of the secretarybird in his ''Icones Animalium et Plantarum'' and coined the [[binomial name]] ''Falco serpentarius''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller|first=John Frederick| author-link=John Frederick Miller | year=1779 | title=Icones Animalium et Plantarum |volume=1|at=pt 5 pl. 28|language=Latin | location=London | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/49649826 }}<!--This is a very rare book.

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but [[France]]. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, much like the way they defend their territory.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[Bird of prey|raptors]] such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognizable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built in a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. All three young can survive to fledging in years with plentiful food. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. It appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe Dutch naturalist [[Arnout Vosmaer]] described the secretarybird in 1769 based on a live specimen that had been sent to Holland from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] two years earlier by an official of the [[Dutch East India Company]].
