In November 1969, the [[My Lai Massacre]] by American troops of between 347 and 504 civilians in a Vietnamese village was exposed, leading to increased public opposition in the United States to the war. The nature of the draft also changed in December 1969, with the first [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]] since World War II. This eliminated deferments allowed in the prior draft process, affecting many college students and teachers.\n\nThe war had appeared to be winding down in 1969, so the new [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]] in 1970 angered those who believed it only exacerbated the conflict. Across the U.S., campuses erupted in protests in what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called \"a nation-wide student strike\", setting the stage for the events of early May 1970.\n\n=== Kent State protest activity, 1966\u20131970 ===\nDuring the 1966 [[Homecoming]] Parade, protesters walked dressed in military paraphernalia with gas masks.<ref name=Means22-26>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=22\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1968, the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and a campus Black Student Organization staged a [[sit-in]] to protest police recruiters on campus. 250 black students walked off campus in a successful amnesty bid for the protesters.<ref name=Means22-26 />\n\nOn April 1, 1969, SDS members attempted to enter the administration building with a list of demands where they clashed with police. In response, the university revoked the Kent State SDS chapter charter. On April 16 a disciplinary hearing involving two of the protesters resulted in a confrontation between supporters and opponents of SDS. The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] was called and 58 were arrested. Four SDS leaders spent six months in prison as a result of the incident.<ref name=Means22-26 />\n\nOn April 10, 1970, [[Jerry Rubin]], a leader of the [[Youth International Party]] (also known as the Yippies), spoke on campus. In remarks reported locally, he said \"The first part of the Yippie program is to kill your parents. They are the first oppressors.\" Two weeks after that, Bill Anthrell, an SDS member and former student, distributed flyers to an event in which he said he was going to [[napalm]] a dog. The event turned out to be an anti-napalm [[teach-in]].<ref name=Means22-26 />\n\n==Timeline==\n\n===Thursday, April 30===\nPresident Nixon announced that the \"[[Cambodian Campaign|Cambodian Incursion]]\" had been launched by United States combat forces.\n\n===Friday, May 1===\nAt Kent State University, a demonstration with about 500 students<ref name=\"task force chronology\">{{cite web| url=http://www.m4tf.org/chronology.html | title=Chronology of events | work=May 4 Task Force | publisher=May 4 Task Force | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}</ref> was held on May 1 on the Commons (a grassy knoll in the center of campus traditionally used as a gathering place for rallies or protests). As the crowd dispersed to attend classes by 1&nbsp;p.m., another rally was planned for May 4 to continue the protest of the [[Cambodian Campaign|expansion of the Vietnam War]] into [[Cambodia]]. There was widespread anger, and many protesters issued a call to \"bring the war home\". A group of history students buried a copy of the [[United States Constitution]] to symbolize that Nixon had killed it.<ref name=\"task force chronology\"/> A sign was put on a tree asking \"Why is the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] building still standing?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=37}}</ref>\n\nTrouble exploded in town around midnight, when people left a bar and began throwing beer bottles at police cars and breaking windows in downtown storefronts. In the process they broke a bank window, setting off an alarm. The news spread quickly and it resulted in several bars closing early to avoid trouble. Before long, more people had joined the vandalism.\n\nBy the time police arrived, a crowd of 120 had already gathered. Some people from the crowd lit a small bonfire in the street. The crowd appeared to be a mix of bikers, students, and transient people. A few members of the crowd began to throw beer bottles at the police, and then started yelling obscenities at them. The entire Kent police force was called to duty as well as officers from the county and surrounding communities. Kent Mayor [[LeRoy Satrom]] declared a [[state of emergency]], called the office of Ohio Governor [[Jim Rhodes]] to seek assistance, and ordered all of the bars closed. The decision to close the bars early increased the size of the angry crowd. Police eventually succeeded in using [[tear gas]] to disperse the crowd from downtown, forcing them to move several blocks back to the campus.<ref name=lewis_hensley/>\n\n===Saturday, May 2===\nCity officials and downtown businesses received threats, and rumors proliferated that radical revolutionaries were in Kent to destroy the city and university. Several merchants reported they were told that if they did not display anti-war slogans, their businesses would be burned down. Kent's police chief told the mayor that according to a reliable informant, the [[ROTC]] building, the local army recruiting station, and post office had been targeted for destruction that night.<ref>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=38}}</ref> There were unconfirmed rumors of students with caches of arms, plots to spike the local water supply with [[LSD]], of students building tunnels for the purpose of blowing up the town's main store.<ref>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=135}}</ref> Mayor Satrom met with Kent city officials and a representative of the [[Ohio Army National Guard]]. Following the meeting, Satrom made the decision to call Governor Rhodes and request that the National Guard be sent to Kent, a request that was granted. Because of the rumors and threats, Satrom believed that local officials would not be able to handle future disturbances.<ref name=lewis_hensley/>\n\nThe decision to call in the National Guard was made at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., but the guard did not arrive in town that evening until around 10&nbsp;p.m. By this time, a large demonstration was underway on the campus, and the campus [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) building was burning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.may4.org/?q=node/5|title=Kent State 1970:Description of Events May 1 through May 4|accessdate=April 3, 2009}}</ref> The arsonists were never apprehended, and no one was injured in the fire. According to the report of the [[President's Commission on Campus Unrest]]:\n\n<blockquote>Information developed by an FBI investigation of the ROTC building fire indicates that, of those who participated actively, a significant portion weren't Kent State students.

Mayor Satrom, under pressure from frightened citizens, ordered a curfew until further notice.\n\nAround 8&nbsp;p.m., another rally was held on the campus Commons. By 8:45&nbsp;p.m., the Guardsmen used tear gas to disperse the crowd, and the students reassembled at the intersection of Lincoln and Main, holding a sit-in with the hopes of gaining a meeting with Mayor Satrom and University President Robert White. At 11:00&nbsp;p.m., the Guard announced that a curfew had gone into effect and began forcing the students back to their dorms.

The protest began with the ringing of the campus's iron Victory Bell (which had historically been used to signal victories in football games) to mark the beginning of the rally, and the first protester began to speak.\n\nCompanies A and C, 1/[[145th Armored Regiment|145th Infantry]] and Troop G of the 2/[[107th Cavalry Regiment|107th Armored Cavalry]], Ohio National Guard (ARNG), the units on the campus grounds, attempted to disperse the students. The legality of the dispersal was later debated at a subsequent wrongful death and injury trial. On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] ruled that authorities did indeed have the right to disperse the crowd.<ref>{{cite court  |litigants = Krause v.

The protesters responded by throwing rocks, striking one campus patrolman and forcing the Jeep to retreat.<ref name=lewis_hensley />\n\nJust before noon, the Guard returned and again ordered the crowd to disperse. When most of the crowd refused, the Guard used [[tear gas]]. Because of wind, the tear gas had little effect in dispersing the crowd, and some launched a second volley of rocks toward the Guard's line and chanted \"Pigs off campus!\" The students lobbed the tear gas canisters back at the National Guardsmen, who wore [[gas mask]]s.\n\nWhen it became clear that the crowd was not going to disperse, a group of 77 National Guard troops from A Company and Troop G, with bayonets fixed on their [[M1 Garand|M1 Garand rifles]], began to advance upon the hundreds of protesters. As the guardsmen advanced, the protesters retreated up and over Blanket Hill, heading out of the Commons area. Once over the hill, the students, in a loose group, moved northeast along the front of Taylor Hall, with some continuing toward a parking lot in front of Prentice Hall (slightly northeast of and perpendicular to Taylor Hall). The guardsmen pursued the protesters over the hill, but rather than veering left as the protesters had, they continued straight, heading toward an athletic practice field enclosed by a chain link fence. Here they remained for about 10 minutes, unsure of how to get out of the area short of retracing their path. During this time, the bulk of the students congregated to the left and front of the guardsmen, approximately {{convert|150|to|225|ft|m|abbr=on}} away, on the veranda of Taylor Hall. Others were scattered between Taylor Hall and the Prentice Hall parking lot, while still others were standing in the parking lot, or dispersing through the lot as they had been previously ordered.\n\nWhile on the practice field, the guardsmen generally faced the parking lot, which was about {{convert|100|yd|m}} away. At one point, some of them knelt and aimed their weapons toward the parking lot, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle and appeared to be talking to one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps back up the hill toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move slowly toward the soldiers as they passed over the top of the hill and headed back into the Commons.\n\n[[File:Map of Shootings at Kent State University in 1970.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the shootings]]\n\nDuring their climb back to Blanket Hill, several guardsmen stopped and half-turned to keep their eyes on the students in the Prentice Hall parking lot.

''Time'' magazine later concluded that \"triggers were not pulled accidentally at Kent State.\" The [[President's Commission on Campus Unrest]] avoided probing the question of why the shootings happened. Instead, it harshly criticized both the protesters and the Guardsmen, but it concluded that \"the indiscriminate firing of rifles into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable.\"<ref>''President's Commission on Campus Unrest'', p. 289.</ref>\n \nThe shootings killed four students and wounded nine.

Brennan]], later appointed U.S. Labor Secretary by President Nixon), resulting in the [[Hard Hat Riot]]. Shortly after the shootings took place, the [[Urban Institute]] conducted a national study that concluded the Kent State shooting was the first nationwide student strike in U.S. history; over 4 million students protested and hundreds of American colleges and universities closed during the student strikes. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks.\n\nJust five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of unarmed student protesters. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969 to 1974, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, \"The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest.

Then [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] said the President was \"pretending indifference\". [[Stanley Karnow]] noted in his ''Vietnam: A History'' that \"The [Nixon] administration initially reacted to this event with wanton insensitivity. Nixon's press secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], whose statements were carefully programmed, referred to the deaths as a reminder that 'when dissent turns to violence, it invites [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]].'\" Three days before the shootings, Nixon had talked of \"bums\" who were antiwar protestors on United States campuses,<ref name=\"bums\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/02/archives/nixon-puts-bums-label-on-some-college-radicals-nixon-denounces-bums.html | title=Nixon puts 'bums' label on some college radicals|last=de Onis|first=Juan|date=May 1, 1970| work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> to which the father of [[Allison Krause]] stated on national TV \"My child was not a bum.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~ineng/mac6/mac6-histcontext.html |title=histcontext |publisher=Lehigh.edu |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nKarnow further documented that at 4:15&nbsp;a.m. on May 9, 1970, the president met about 30 student dissidents conducting a vigil at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], whereupon Nixon \"treated them to a clumsy and condescending monologue, which he made public in an awkward attempt to display his benevolence.\" Nixon had been trailed by White House Deputy for Domestic Affairs [[Egil Krogh]], who saw it differently, saying, \"I thought it was a very significant and major effort to reach out.\"<ref name=\"Nix Prez Rev\"/> In any regard, neither side could convince the other and after meeting with the students, Nixon expressed that those in the anti-war movement were the pawns of foreign communists.<ref name=\"Nix Prez Rev\"/> After the student protests, Nixon asked [[H.

These debates served to further galvanize uncommitted opinion by the terms of the discourse.

The report said:\n\n<blockquote>Even if the guardsmen faced danger, it was not a danger that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen certainly cannot be justified. Apparently, no order to fire was given, and there was inadequate fire control discipline on Blanket Hill. The Kent State tragedy must mark the last time that, as a matter of course, loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators.</blockquote>\n\n===Legal action===\nIn September 1970, twenty-four students and one faculty member, identified from photographs, were indicted on charges connected with the May 4 demonstration at the ROTC building fire three days before; they became known as the \"Kent 25\".

The guardsmen claimed to have fired in self-defense, a claim that was generally accepted by the criminal justice system. In 1974 U.S. District Judge [[Frank J.

The federal court civil action for wrongful death and injury, brought by the victims and their families against Governor [[Jim Rhodes|Rhodes]], the President of Kent State, and the National Guardsmen, resulted in unanimous verdicts for all defendants on all claims after an eleven-week trial.<ref>Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/attorney-for-students-who-were-shot-at-kent-state-dies-in-new-york/ \"Attorney for Students who were Shot at Kent State Dies in New York\"], Activist Defense, March 8, 2013.</ref> The judgment on those verdicts was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the ground that the federal trial judge had mishandled an out-of-court threat against a juror.

The students may have believed that they were right in continuing their mass protest in response to the Cambodian invasion, even though this protest followed the posting and reading by the university of an order to ban rallies and an order to disperse. These orders have since been determined by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to have been lawful.\n\nSome of the Guardsmen on Blanket Hill, fearful and anxious from prior events, may have believed in their own minds that their lives were in danger. Hindsight suggests that another method would have resolved the confrontation. Better ways must be found to deal with such a confrontation.\n\nWe devoutly wish that a means had been found to avoid the May 4th events culminating in the Guard shootings and the irreversible deaths and injuries. We deeply regret those events and are profoundly saddened by the deaths of four students and the wounding of nine others which resulted. We hope that the agreement to end the litigation will help to assuage the tragic memories regarding that sad day.}}\n\nIn the succeeding years, many in the anti-war movement have referred to the shootings as \"murders,\" although no criminal convictions were obtained against any National Guardsman. In December 1970, journalist [[I. F. Stone]] wrote the following:\n\n<blockquote>To those who think murder is too strong a word, one may recall that even [Vice President Spiro] [[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] three days after the Kent State shootings used the word in an interview on the [[David Frost]] show in Los Angeles. Agnew admitted in response to a question that what happened at Kent State was murder, \"but not first degree\" since there was \u2013 as Agnew explained from his own training as a lawyer \u2013 \"no premeditation but simply an over-response in the heat of anger that results in a killing; it's a murder.

The only equipment the guardsmen had to disperse demonstrators that day were [[M1 Garand]] rifles loaded with [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] ammunition, 12 Ga. pump shotguns, [[bayonet]]s, and [[CS gas]] [[Hand grenade#Chemical and gas|grenades]]. In the years that followed, the U.S. Army began developing [[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal means]] of dispersing demonstrators (such as [[rubber bullet]]s), and changed its crowd control and riot tactics to attempt to avoid casualties amongst the demonstrators. Many of the crowd-control changes brought on by the Kent State events are used today by police and military forces in the United States when facing similar situations, such as the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] and civil disorder during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.\n\nOne outgrowth of the events was the Center for Peaceful Change established at Kent State University in 1971 \"as a living memorial to the events of May 4, 1970\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.edu/cacm/ |title=Center for Applied Conflict Management |date=January 29, 2007 |work=CACM Homepage |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303135344/http://www.kent.edu/cacm/ |archivedate=March 3, 2007 }}</ref> Now known as The Center for Applied Conflict Management (CACM), it developed one of the earliest [[conflict resolution]] undergraduate degree programs in the United States.

The original 30-minute [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]] was made by Terry Strubbe, a Kent State communications student who turned on his recorder and put its microphone in his dormitory window overlooking the campus.<ref name=\"shafer\"/> At that time, Canfora asserted that an amplified version of the tape reveals the order to shoot, \"Right here! Get Set! Point! Fire!\". Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings and was one of those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna ''[[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Record-Courier]]'' newspaper in May 2007: \"I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that.\" Referring to the assertion that the tape reveals the order,  Shafer went on to say, \"That's not to say there may not have been, but with all the racket and noise, I don't know how anyone could have heard anything that day.\" Shafer also said that \"point\" would not have been part of a proper command to open fire.<ref name=\"shafer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/02/AR2007050200322.html|title=Kent State Audio Tape Released|last=Sheeran|first=Thomas J.|date=May 2, 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 audio analysis of the Strubbe tape by Stuart Allen and Tom Owen, who were described by the Cleveland ''[[The Plain Dealer|Plain Dealer]]'' as \"nationally respected forensic audio experts,\" concluded that the guardsmen were given an order to fire. It is the only known recording to capture the events leading up to the shootings. According to the ''Plain Dealer'' description of the enhanced recording, a male voice yells \"Guard!\" Several seconds pass. Then, \"All right, prepare to fire!\" \"Get down!,\" someone shouts urgently, presumably in the crowd. Finally, \"Guard!&nbsp;...\" followed two seconds later by a long, booming volley of gunshots. The entire spoken sequence lasts 17 seconds. Further analysis of the audiotape revealed that what sounded like four pistol shots and a confrontation occurred approximately 70 seconds before the National Guard opened fire. According to ''The Plain Dealer'', this new analysis raised questions about the role of [[Terry Norman]], a Kent State student who was an FBI informant and known to be carrying a pistol during the disturbance. Alan Canfora said it was premature to reach any conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Mangels |url=http://www.cleveland.com/science/index.ssf/2010/10/analysis_of_kent_state_audio_t.html |title=Kent State tape indicates altercation and pistol fire preceded National Guard shootings (audio) | work=Cleveland Plain Dealer | date=October 8, 2010 |publisher=Cleveland.com |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Strubbe>{{cite news|last=Maag |first=Christopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/us/12brfs-ANALYSISREOP_BRF.html |title=Ohio: Analysis Reopens Kent State Controversy |work=The New York Times |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] determined that there were \"insurmountable legal and evidentiary barriers\" to reopening the case.

Despite this, organizations of survivors and current Kent State students continue to believe the Strubbe tape proves the Guardsmen were given a military order to fire and are petitioning State of Ohio and United States government officials to reopen the case using independent analysis.

Upon the university's announcement in 1976 that it would no longer sponsor such commemorations, the May 4 Task Force, a group made up of students and community members, was formed for this purpose. The group has organized a commemoration on the university's campus each year since 1976; events generally include a silent march around the campus, a candlelight vigil, a ringing of the Victory Bell in memory of those killed and injured, speakers (always including eyewitnesses and family members), and music.\n\nOn May 12, 1977, a [[tent city]] was erected and maintained for a period of more than 60 days by a group of several dozen protesters on the Kent State campus.

On Friday, May 1, an anti-war rally was held on the Commons at Kent State University. Protestors called for another rally to be held on Monday, May 4.

In November 1969, the [[My Lai Massacre]] by American troops of between 347 and 504 civilians in a Vietnamese village was exposed, leading to increased public opposition in the United States to the war. The nature of the draft also changed in December 1969, with the first [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]] since World War II. This eliminated deferments allowed in the prior draft process, affecting many college students and teachers.\n\nThe war had appeared to be winding down in 1969, so the new [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]] in 1970 angered those who believed it only exacerbated the conflict. Across the U.S., campuses erupted in protests in what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called \"a nation-wide student strike\", setting the stage for the events of early May 1970.\n\n=== Kent State protest activity, 1966\u20131970 ===\nDuring the 1966 [[Homecoming]] Parade, protesters walked dressed in military paraphernalia with gas masks.<ref name=Means22-26>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=22\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1968, the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and a campus Black Student Organization staged a [[sit-in]] to protest police recruiters on campus. 250 black students walked off campus in a successful amnesty bid for the protesters.<ref name=Means22-26 />\n\nOn April 1, 1969, SDS members attempted to enter the administration building with a list of demands where they clashed with police. In response, the university revoked the Kent State SDS chapter charter. On April 16 a disciplinary hearing involving two of the protesters resulted in a confrontation between supporters and opponents of SDS. The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] was called and 58 were arrested. Four SDS leaders spent six months in prison as a result of the incident.<ref name=Means22-26 />\n\nOn April 10, 1970, [[Jerry Rubin]], a leader of the [[Youth International Party]] (also known as the Yippies), spoke on campus. In remarks reported locally, he said \"The first part of the Yippie program is to kill your parents. They are the first oppressors.\" Two weeks after that, Bill Anthrell, an SDS member and former student, distributed flyers to an event in which he said he was going to [[napalm]] a dog. The event turned out to be an anti-napalm [[teach-in]].<ref name=Means22-26 />\n\n==Timeline==\n\n===Thursday, April 30===\nPresident Nixon announced that the \"[[Cambodian Campaign|Cambodian Incursion]]\" had been launched by United States combat forces.\n\n===Friday, May 1===\nAt Kent State University, a demonstration with about 500 students<ref name=\"task force chronology\">{{cite web| url=http://www.m4tf.org/chronology.html | title=Chronology of events | work=May 4 Task Force | publisher=May 4 Task Force | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}</ref> was held on May 1 on the Commons (a grassy knoll in the center of campus traditionally used as a gathering place for rallies or protests). As the crowd dispersed to attend classes by 1&nbsp;p.m., another rally was planned for May 4 to continue the protest of the [[Cambodian Campaign|expansion of the Vietnam War]] into [[Cambodia]]. There was widespread anger, and many protesters issued a call to \"bring the war home\". A group of history students buried a copy of the [[United States Constitution]] to symbolize that Nixon had killed it.<ref name=\"task force chronology\"/> A sign was put on a tree asking \"Why is the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] building still standing?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=37}}</ref>\n\nTrouble exploded in town around midnight, when people left a bar and began throwing beer bottles at police cars and breaking windows in downtown storefronts. In the process they broke a bank window, setting off an alarm. The news spread quickly and it resulted in several bars closing early to avoid trouble. Before long, more people had joined the vandalism.\n\nBy the time police arrived, a crowd of 120 had already gathered. Some people from the crowd lit a small bonfire in the street. The crowd appeared to be a mix of bikers, students, and transient people. A few members of the crowd began to throw beer bottles at the police, and then started yelling obscenities at them. The entire Kent police force was called to duty as well as officers from the county and surrounding communities. Kent Mayor [[LeRoy Satrom]] declared a [[state of emergency]], called the office of Ohio Governor [[Jim Rhodes]] to seek assistance, and ordered all of the bars closed. The decision to close the bars early increased the size of the angry crowd. Police eventually succeeded in using [[tear gas]] to disperse the crowd from downtown, forcing them to move several blocks back to the campus.<ref name=lewis_hensley/>\n\n===Saturday, May 2===\nCity officials and downtown businesses received threats, and rumors proliferated that radical revolutionaries were in Kent to destroy the city and university. Several merchants reported they were told that if they did not display anti-war slogans, their businesses would be burned down. Kent's police chief told the mayor that according to a reliable informant, the [[ROTC]] building, the local army recruiting station, and post office had been targeted for destruction that night.<ref>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=38}}</ref> There were unconfirmed rumors of students with caches of arms, plots to spike the local water supply with [[LSD]], of students building tunnels for the purpose of blowing up the town's main store.<ref>{{harvnb|Means|2016|pp=135}}</ref> Mayor Satrom met with Kent city officials and a representative of the [[Ohio Army National Guard]]. Following the meeting, Satrom made the decision to call Governor Rhodes and request that the National Guard be sent to Kent, a request that was granted. Because of the rumors and threats, Satrom believed that local officials would not be able to handle future disturbances.<ref name=lewis_hensley/>\n\nThe decision to call in the National Guard was made at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., but the guard did not arrive in town that evening until around 10&nbsp;p.m. By this time, a large demonstration was underway on the campus, and the campus [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) building was burning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.may4.org/?q=node/5|title=Kent State 1970:Description of Events May 1 through May 4|accessdate=April 3, 2009}}</ref> The arsonists were never apprehended, and no one was injured in the fire.

The protest began with the ringing of the campus's iron Victory Bell (which had historically been used to signal victories in football games) to mark the beginning of the rally, and the first protester began to speak.\n\nCompanies A and C, 1/[[145th Armored Regiment|145th Infantry]] and Troop G of the 2/[[107th Cavalry Regiment|107th Armored Cavalry]], Ohio National Guard (ARNG), the units on the campus grounds, attempted to disperse the students. The legality of the dispersal was later debated at a subsequent wrongful death and injury trial.

When most of the crowd refused, the Guard used [[tear gas]]. Because of wind, the tear gas had little effect in dispersing the crowd, and some launched a second volley of rocks toward the Guard's line and chanted \"Pigs off campus!\" The students lobbed the tear gas canisters back at the National Guardsmen, who wore [[gas mask]]s.\n\nWhen it became clear that the crowd was not going to disperse, a group of 77 National Guard troops from A Company and Troop G, with bayonets fixed on their [[M1 Garand|M1 Garand rifles]], began to advance upon the hundreds of protesters. As the guardsmen advanced, the protesters retreated up and over Blanket Hill, heading out of the Commons area. Once over the hill, the students, in a loose group, moved northeast along the front of Taylor Hall, with some continuing toward a parking lot in front of Prentice Hall (slightly northeast of and perpendicular to Taylor Hall). The guardsmen pursued the protesters over the hill, but rather than veering left as the protesters had, they continued straight, heading toward an athletic practice field enclosed by a chain link fence. Here they remained for about 10 minutes, unsure of how to get out of the area short of retracing their path. During this time, the bulk of the students congregated to the left and front of the guardsmen, approximately {{convert|150|to|225|ft|m|abbr=on}} away, on the veranda of Taylor Hall. Others were scattered between Taylor Hall and the Prentice Hall parking lot, while still others were standing in the parking lot, or dispersing through the lot as they had been previously ordered.\n\nWhile on the practice field, the guardsmen generally faced the parking lot, which was about {{convert|100|yd|m}} away. At one point, some of them knelt and aimed their weapons toward the parking lot, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle and appeared to be talking to one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps back up the hill toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move slowly toward the soldiers as they passed over the top of the hill and headed back into the Commons.\n\n[[File:Map of Shootings at Kent State University in 1970.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the shootings]]\n\nDuring their climb back to Blanket Hill, several guardsmen stopped and half-turned to keep their eyes on the students in the Prentice Hall parking lot.

''Time'' magazine later concluded that \"triggers were not pulled accidentally at Kent State.\" The [[President's Commission on Campus Unrest]] avoided probing the question of why the shootings happened. Instead, it harshly criticized both the protesters and the Guardsmen, but it concluded that \"the indiscriminate firing of rifles into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable.\"<ref>''President's Commission on Campus Unrest'', p. 289.</ref>\n \nThe shootings killed four students and wounded nine.

Brennan]], later appointed U.S. Labor Secretary by President Nixon), resulting in the [[Hard Hat Riot]]. Shortly after the shootings took place, the [[Urban Institute]] conducted a national study that concluded the Kent State shooting was the first nationwide student strike in U.S. history; over 4 million students protested and hundreds of American colleges and universities closed during the student strikes. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks.\n\nJust five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of unarmed student protesters. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969 to 1974, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, \"The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest.

Then [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] said the President was \"pretending indifference\". [[Stanley Karnow]] noted in his ''Vietnam: A History'' that \"The [Nixon] administration initially reacted to this event with wanton insensitivity. Nixon's press secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], whose statements were carefully programmed, referred to the deaths as a reminder that 'when dissent turns to violence, it invites [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]].'\" Three days before the shootings, Nixon had talked of \"bums\" who were antiwar protestors on United States campuses,<ref name=\"bums\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/02/archives/nixon-puts-bums-label-on-some-college-radicals-nixon-denounces-bums.html | title=Nixon puts 'bums' label on some college radicals|last=de Onis|first=Juan|date=May 1, 1970| work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> to which the father of [[Allison Krause]] stated on national TV \"My child was not a bum.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~ineng/mac6/mac6-histcontext.html |title=histcontext |publisher=Lehigh.edu |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nKarnow further documented that at 4:15&nbsp;a.m. on May 9, 1970, the president met about 30 student dissidents conducting a vigil at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], whereupon Nixon \"treated them to a clumsy and condescending monologue, which he made public in an awkward attempt to display his benevolence.\" Nixon had been trailed by White House Deputy for Domestic Affairs [[Egil Krogh]], who saw it differently, saying, \"I thought it was a very significant and major effort to reach out.\"<ref name=\"Nix Prez Rev\"/> In any regard, neither side could convince the other and after meeting with the students, Nixon expressed that those in the anti-war movement were the pawns of foreign communists.<ref name=\"Nix Prez Rev\"/> After the student protests, Nixon asked [[H.

These debates served to further galvanize uncommitted opinion by the terms of the discourse.

The report said:\n\n<blockquote>Even if the guardsmen faced danger, it was not a danger that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen certainly cannot be justified. Apparently, no order to fire was given, and there was inadequate fire control discipline on Blanket Hill. The Kent State tragedy must mark the last time that, as a matter of course, loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators.</blockquote>\n\n===Legal action===\nIn September 1970, twenty-four students and one faculty member, identified from photographs, were indicted on charges connected with the May 4 demonstration at the ROTC building fire three days before; they became known as the \"Kent 25\".

The guardsmen claimed to have fired in self-defense, a claim that was generally accepted by the criminal justice system. In 1974 U.S. District Judge [[Frank J.

The federal court civil action for wrongful death and injury, brought by the victims and their families against Governor [[Jim Rhodes|Rhodes]], the President of Kent State, and the National Guardsmen, resulted in unanimous verdicts for all defendants on all claims after an eleven-week trial.<ref>Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/attorney-for-students-who-were-shot-at-kent-state-dies-in-new-york/ \"Attorney for Students who were Shot at Kent State Dies in New York\"], Activist Defense, March 8, 2013.</ref> The judgment on those verdicts was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the ground that the federal trial judge had mishandled an out-of-court threat against a juror.

The students may have believed that they were right in continuing their mass protest in response to the Cambodian invasion, even though this protest followed the posting and reading by the university of an order to ban rallies and an order to disperse. These orders have since been determined by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to have been lawful.\n\nSome of the Guardsmen on Blanket Hill, fearful and anxious from prior events, may have believed in their own minds that their lives were in danger. Hindsight suggests that another method would have resolved the confrontation. Better ways must be found to deal with such a confrontation.\n\nWe devoutly wish that a means had been found to avoid the May 4th events culminating in the Guard shootings and the irreversible deaths and injuries. We deeply regret those events and are profoundly saddened by the deaths of four students and the wounding of nine others which resulted. We hope that the agreement to end the litigation will help to assuage the tragic memories regarding that sad day.}}\n\nIn the succeeding years, many in the anti-war movement have referred to the shootings as \"murders,\" although no criminal convictions were obtained against any National Guardsman. In December 1970, journalist [[I. F. Stone]] wrote the following:\n\n<blockquote>To those who think murder is too strong a word, one may recall that even [Vice President Spiro] [[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] three days after the Kent State shootings used the word in an interview on the [[David Frost]] show in Los Angeles. Agnew admitted in response to a question that what happened at Kent State was murder, \"but not first degree\" since there was \u2013 as Agnew explained from his own training as a lawyer \u2013 \"no premeditation but simply an over-response in the heat of anger that results in a killing; it's a murder.

The only equipment the guardsmen had to disperse demonstrators that day were [[M1 Garand]] rifles loaded with [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] ammunition, 12 Ga. pump shotguns, [[bayonet]]s, and [[CS gas]] [[Hand grenade#Chemical and gas|grenades]]. In the years that followed, the U.S. Army began developing [[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal means]] of dispersing demonstrators (such as [[rubber bullet]]s), and changed its crowd control and riot tactics to attempt to avoid casualties amongst the demonstrators. Many of the crowd-control changes brought on by the Kent State events are used today by police and military forces in the United States when facing similar situations, such as the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] and civil disorder during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.\n\nOne outgrowth of the events was the Center for Peaceful Change established at Kent State University in 1971 \"as a living memorial to the events of May 4, 1970\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.edu/cacm/ |title=Center for Applied Conflict Management |date=January 29, 2007 |work=CACM Homepage |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303135344/http://www.kent.edu/cacm/ |archivedate=March 3, 2007 }}</ref> Now known as The Center for Applied Conflict Management (CACM), it developed one of the earliest [[conflict resolution]] undergraduate degree programs in the United States.

The original 30-minute [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]] was made by Terry Strubbe, a Kent State communications student who turned on his recorder and put its microphone in his dormitory window overlooking the campus.<ref name=\"shafer\"/> At that time, Canfora asserted that an amplified version of the tape reveals the order to shoot, \"Right here! Get Set! Point! Fire!\". Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings and was one of those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna ''[[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Record-Courier]]'' newspaper in May 2007: \"I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that.\" Referring to the assertion that the tape reveals the order,  Shafer went on to say, \"That's not to say there may not have been, but with all the racket and noise, I don't know how anyone could have heard anything that day.\" Shafer also said that \"point\" would not have been part of a proper command to open fire.<ref name=\"shafer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/02/AR2007050200322.html|title=Kent State Audio Tape Released|last=Sheeran|first=Thomas J.|date=May 2, 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 audio analysis of the Strubbe tape by Stuart Allen and Tom Owen, who were described by the Cleveland ''[[The Plain Dealer|Plain Dealer]]'' as \"nationally respected forensic audio experts,\" concluded that the guardsmen were given an order to fire. It is the only known recording to capture the events leading up to the shootings. According to the ''Plain Dealer'' description of the enhanced recording, a male voice yells \"Guard!\" Several seconds pass. Then, \"All right, prepare to fire!\" \"Get down!,\" someone shouts urgently, presumably in the crowd. Finally, \"Guard!&nbsp;...\" followed two seconds later by a long, booming volley of gunshots. The entire spoken sequence lasts 17 seconds. Further analysis of the audiotape revealed that what sounded like four pistol shots and a confrontation occurred approximately 70 seconds before the National Guard opened fire. According to ''The Plain Dealer'', this new analysis raised questions about the role of [[Terry Norman]], a Kent State student who was an FBI informant and known to be carrying a pistol during the disturbance. Alan Canfora said it was premature to reach any conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Mangels |url=http://www.cleveland.com/science/index.ssf/2010/10/analysis_of_kent_state_audio_t.html |title=Kent State tape indicates altercation and pistol fire preceded National Guard shootings (audio) | work=Cleveland Plain Dealer | date=October 8, 2010 |publisher=Cleveland.com |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Strubbe>{{cite news|last=Maag |first=Christopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/us/12brfs-ANALYSISREOP_BRF.html |title=Ohio: Analysis Reopens Kent State Controversy |work=The New York Times |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] determined that there were \"insurmountable legal and evidentiary barriers\" to reopening the case.

Despite this, organizations of survivors and current Kent State students continue to believe the Strubbe tape proves the Guardsmen were given a military order to fire and are petitioning State of Ohio and United States government officials to reopen the case using independent analysis.

Upon the university's announcement in 1976 that it would no longer sponsor such commemorations, the May 4 Task Force, a group made up of students and community members, was formed for this purpose. The group has organized a commemoration on the university's campus each year since 1976; events generally include a silent march around the campus, a candlelight vigil, a ringing of the Victory Bell in memory of those killed and injured, speakers (always including eyewitnesses and family members), and music.\n\nOn May 12, 1977, a [[tent city]] was erected and maintained for a period of more than 60 days by a group of several dozen protesters on the Kent State campus.

On Friday, May 1, an anti-war rally was held on the Commons at Kent State University. Protestors called for another rally to be held on Monday, May 4.
