Pueblo, South Pueblo, and Central Pueblo legally consolidated as the City of Pueblo between March 9 and April 6, 1886. Bessemer joined Pueblo in 1894.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Aschermann\n | title=Winds in the Cornfields\n | year = 1994\n | page = 51\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Dodds\n | title=They All Came To Pueblo\n | year = 1994\n | page = 168\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Dodds\n | title=Pueblo\n | year = 1982\n | pages = 54, 63\n | nopp =true\n}}</ref>\n\nThe consolidated city became a major economic and social center of Colorado, and was home to important early Colorado families such as the Thatchers, the [[James Bradley Orman|Ormans]], and the Adams. By the early 1870s the city was being hailed as a beacon of development, with newspapers like the Chicago Tribune boasting of how the region's lawless reputation was giving way to orderly agriculture with triumphalist rhetoric. One author crowed of Pueblo that \"the necessity exists no longer for Sharp's rifles and revolvers. These have been supplied by the plow and the mowing-machine.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pueblo: a Glimpse of Life in Southern Colorado|last = |first = |date = April 16, 1873|journal = Chicago Tribune|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nPueblo's development stretched beyond agriculture. Steel emerged as a key industry very early, and in 1909 the city was considered the only steel town west of the Mississippi River.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pueblo has Been Developed into Great Steel City by Vast Industry of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co.|last = |first = |date = September 17, 1909|journal = Christian Science Monitor|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nUntil a series of major floods culminated in the Great Flood of 1921, Pueblo was considered the 'Saddle-Making capital of the World'. Roughly one-third of Pueblo's downtown businesses were lost in this flood, along with a substantial number of buildings. Pueblo struggled with this significant loss, but has had a resurgence in growth.\n\nPueblo's orphanages were an influential part of the city. The transformations that have occurred throughout the three orphanages in the town of Pueblo, Colorado are important aspects of the city's history. Historically, many people were influenced by the Orphanages of Pueblo, Colorado and the homes are now all historical sites.  The transformations have occurred architecturally and economically within the people from then to now. The three orphanages in Pueblo were known as Sacred Heart, Lincoln, and McClelland. Lincoln was the first historically black orphanage in Colorado, and one of only seven in the country. Sacred Heart was run by the Catholic Welfare Bureau, while McClelland was run by the Lutheran Church. Several children from Cuba were placed at Sacred Heart as part of \"Operation Pedro Pan\". Though the Orphanages in Pueblo are no longer in service, the buildings still exist and have transformed with the times. According to the Rocky Mountain News, in 1988 the Sacred Heart Orphanage was bought by the Pueblo Housing Authority and turned into 40 small-family housing units.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sacred Heart Orphanage bought by the Pueblo Housing Authority |last = |first = |date = May 29, 1988|journal = Rocky Mountain News|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pueblo Colorado Business District Flood 1921.JPG|thumb|left|From ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine (1921)]]\n\n===Steel mill===\n{{Main|Colorado Fuel and Iron}}\nThe main industry in Pueblo for most of its history was the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]] (CF&I) Steel Mill on the south side of town. For nearly a century the CF&I was the largest employer in the state of Colorado. The steel-market crash of 1982 led to the decline of the company. After several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by [[Oregon Steel Mills, Inc.|Oregon Steel Mills]] and changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. The company was plagued with labor problems, mostly due to accusations of unfair labor practices. This culminated with a major strike in 1997, leading to most of the workforce being replaced.\n\nIn September 2004, both [[United Steelworkers]] locals 2102 and 3267 won the strike and the unfair labor practice charges. All of the striking steel workers returned to their jobs, and the company paid them the back pay owed for the seven years they were on strike. In 2007, shortly after Oregon Steel made amends with the union and its workers, [[Evraz Group]], one of Russia's biggest steel producers, agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chieftain.com/metro/russian-steel-giant-to-buy-oregon-steel/article_d51a1587-a249-5f23-8aca-89028033acbd.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723232110/http://www.chieftain.com/metro/russian-steel-giant-to-buy-oregon-steel/article_d51a1587-a249-5f23-8aca-89028033acbd.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-23 |title=Russian steel giant to buy Oregon Steel - Pueblo Chieftain: Metro |publisher=Chieftain.com |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2012-05-26 }}</ref>\n\nOf the many production and fabrication mills that once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless tube mills are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which still produces products such as fence and nails under the CF&I brand name.\n\nThe facility operated blast furnaces until 1982, when the steel market collapsed. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989, but due to asbestos content, many of the adjacent stoves still remain. The stoves and foundations for some of the furnaces can be seen from Interstate 25, which runs parallel to the plant's west boundary.\n\nSeveral of the administration buildings, including the main office building, dispensary, and tunnel gatehouse were purchased in 2003 by the [[Bessemer Historical Society]]. In 2006, they underwent renovation. In addition to housing the historic CF&I Archives, they also house the [[Steelworks Museum of Industry and Culture]].\n\n===\"Melting Pot of the West\"===\nDue to the growth of the [[CF&I]] steel mill and the employment that it offered, Pueblo in the early twentieth century attracted a large number of immigrant laborers. The groups represented led to Pueblo becoming the most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Colorado and the West. At one point, more than 40 languages were spoken in the steel mill and more than two-dozen foreign language newspapers were published in the city.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/slow-to-rebound-pueblo-is-redefining-its-economic-image/|title=Slow to rebound, Pueblo is redefining its economic image|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=December 5, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2018}}</ref> [[Irish-American|Irish]], [[Italian-American|Italian]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chieftain.com/entertainmentlife/20200313/la-museum-spotlights-pueblos-st-joseph-tables|title=LA museum spotlights Pueblo's St. Joseph Tables|work=The Pueblo Chieftain|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> [[German-American|German]], [[Slovene American|Slovenian]], [[Greek-American|Greek]], [[Jewish-American|Jewish]], [[Lithuanian-American|Lithuanian]], [[Russian-American|Russian]], [[Hungarian-American|Hungarian]], [[Japanese-American|Japanese]], and [[African-American]] groups arrived in the area at the turn of the century and remain to the present time. The convergence of cultures led to a cosmopolitan character to the city that resulted in a number of ethnically-rooted neighborhoods that are typically not seen west of the Mississippi. Respective cultural groups maintain cultural festivals to the present, with the city being home to locations of the [[Order Sons of Italy in America|Order Sons of Italy]], [[American Slovenian Catholic Union]], and [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|I.O.O.F.]], among others.\n\n===Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo===\nAnother major employer in Pueblo is the Colorado State Hospital. The hospital is the preeminent mental health facility in the Rocky Mountain region. Established in 1879 as the Colorado State Insane Asylum, it was renamed as the Colorado State Hospital in 1917. In 1991, the name was changed to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP). The Robert L. Hawkins High Security Forensic Institute opened in June 2009 and is a 200-bed, high-security facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/CDHS-BehavioralHealth/CBON/1251580690622 |title=About Us |publisher=State of Colorado |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009074137/http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/CDHS-BehavioralHealth/CBON/1251580690622 |archivedate=October 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Home of Heroes===\nPueblo is the hometown of four [[Medal of Honor]] recipients (more than any other municipality in the United States) - [[William J. Crawford]], [[Carl L. Sitter]], [[Raymond G. Murphy]], and [[Drew D. Dix]]. President [[Dwight D.

In 2017 voters passed Question 2A changing the city charter to a strong-mayor form of city government known as \"Mayor-Council Government\". Only two other cities in the state of Colorado use the strong-mayor form of government, Denver and Colorado Springs. In 2018 an election was held for mayor for the first time in over sixty years, due to none of the sixteen candidates getting more than fifty percent of the vote, a runoff was required to decide the winner.

Pueblo, South Pueblo, and Central Pueblo legally consolidated as the City of Pueblo between March 9 and April 6, 1886.

By the early 1870s the city was being hailed as a beacon of development, with newspapers like the Chicago Tribune boasting of how the region's lawless reputation was giving way to orderly agriculture with triumphalist rhetoric. One author crowed of Pueblo that \"the necessity exists no longer for Sharp's rifles and revolvers. These have been supplied by the plow and the mowing-machine.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pueblo: a Glimpse of Life in Southern Colorado|last = |first = |date = April 16, 1873|journal = Chicago Tribune|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nPueblo's development stretched beyond agriculture. Steel emerged as a key industry very early, and in 1909 the city was considered the only steel town west of the Mississippi River.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pueblo has Been Developed into Great Steel City by Vast Industry of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co.|last = |first = |date = September 17, 1909|journal = Christian Science Monitor|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nUntil a series of major floods culminated in the Great Flood of 1921, Pueblo was considered the 'Saddle-Making capital of the World'. Roughly one-third of Pueblo's downtown businesses were lost in this flood, along with a substantial number of buildings. Pueblo struggled with this significant loss, but has had a resurgence in growth.\n\nPueblo's orphanages were an influential part of the city. The transformations that have occurred throughout the three orphanages in the town of Pueblo, Colorado are important aspects of the city's history. Historically, many people were influenced by the Orphanages of Pueblo, Colorado and the homes are now all historical sites.  The transformations have occurred architecturally and economically within the people from then to now. The three orphanages in Pueblo were known as Sacred Heart, Lincoln, and McClelland. Lincoln was the first historically black orphanage in Colorado, and one of only seven in the country. Sacred Heart was run by the Catholic Welfare Bureau, while McClelland was run by the Lutheran Church. Several children from Cuba were placed at Sacred Heart as part of \"Operation Pedro Pan\". Though the Orphanages in Pueblo are no longer in service, the buildings still exist and have transformed with the times. According to the Rocky Mountain News, in 1988 the Sacred Heart Orphanage was bought by the Pueblo Housing Authority and turned into 40 small-family housing units.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sacred Heart Orphanage bought by the Pueblo Housing Authority |last = |first = |date = May 29, 1988|journal = Rocky Mountain News|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pueblo Colorado Business District Flood 1921.JPG|thumb|left|From ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine (1921)]]\n\n===Steel mill===\n{{Main|Colorado Fuel and Iron}}\nThe main industry in Pueblo for most of its history was the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]] (CF&I) Steel Mill on the south side of town. For nearly a century the CF&I was the largest employer in the state of Colorado. The steel-market crash of 1982 led to the decline of the company. After several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by [[Oregon Steel Mills, Inc.|Oregon Steel Mills]] and changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. The company was plagued with labor problems, mostly due to accusations of unfair labor practices. This culminated with a major strike in 1997, leading to most of the workforce being replaced.\n\nIn September 2004, both [[United Steelworkers]] locals 2102 and 3267 won the strike and the unfair labor practice charges. All of the striking steel workers returned to their jobs, and the company paid them the back pay owed for the seven years they were on strike. In 2007, shortly after Oregon Steel made amends with the union and its workers, [[Evraz Group]], one of Russia's biggest steel producers, agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chieftain.com/metro/russian-steel-giant-to-buy-oregon-steel/article_d51a1587-a249-5f23-8aca-89028033acbd.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723232110/http://www.chieftain.com/metro/russian-steel-giant-to-buy-oregon-steel/article_d51a1587-a249-5f23-8aca-89028033acbd.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-23 |title=Russian steel giant to buy Oregon Steel - Pueblo Chieftain: Metro |publisher=Chieftain.com |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2012-05-26 }}</ref>\n\nOf the many production and fabrication mills that once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless tube mills are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which still produces products such as fence and nails under the CF&I brand name.\n\nThe facility operated blast furnaces until 1982, when the steel market collapsed. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989, but due to asbestos content, many of the adjacent stoves still remain. The stoves and foundations for some of the furnaces can be seen from Interstate 25, which runs parallel to the plant's west boundary.\n\nSeveral of the administration buildings, including the main office building, dispensary, and tunnel gatehouse were purchased in 2003 by the [[Bessemer Historical Society]]. In 2006, they underwent renovation. In addition to housing the historic CF&I Archives, they also house the [[Steelworks Museum of Industry and Culture]].\n\n===\"Melting Pot of the West\"===\nDue to the growth of the [[CF&I]] steel mill and the employment that it offered, Pueblo in the early twentieth century attracted a large number of immigrant laborers. The groups represented led to Pueblo becoming the most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Colorado and the West. At one point, more than 40 languages were spoken in the steel mill and more than two-dozen foreign language newspapers were published in the city.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/slow-to-rebound-pueblo-is-redefining-its-economic-image/|title=Slow to rebound, Pueblo is redefining its economic image|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=December 5, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2018}}</ref> [[Irish-American|Irish]], [[Italian-American|Italian]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chieftain.com/entertainmentlife/20200313/la-museum-spotlights-pueblos-st-joseph-tables|title=LA museum spotlights Pueblo's St. Joseph Tables|work=The Pueblo Chieftain|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> [[German-American|German]], [[Slovene American|Slovenian]], [[Greek-American|Greek]], [[Jewish-American|Jewish]], [[Lithuanian-American|Lithuanian]], [[Russian-American|Russian]], [[Hungarian-American|Hungarian]], [[Japanese-American|Japanese]], and [[African-American]] groups arrived in the area at the turn of the century and remain to the present time. The convergence of cultures led to a cosmopolitan character to the city that resulted in a number of ethnically-rooted neighborhoods that are typically not seen west of the Mississippi. Respective cultural groups maintain cultural festivals to the present, with the city being home to locations of the [[Order Sons of Italy in America|Order Sons of Italy]], [[American Slovenian Catholic Union]], and [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|I.O.O.F.]], among others.\n\n===Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo===\nAnother major employer in Pueblo is the Colorado State Hospital. The hospital is the preeminent mental health facility in the Rocky Mountain region. Established in 1879 as the Colorado State Insane Asylum, it was renamed as the Colorado State Hospital in 1917. In 1991, the name was changed to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP). The Robert L. Hawkins High Security Forensic Institute opened in June 2009 and is a 200-bed, high-security facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/CDHS-BehavioralHealth/CBON/1251580690622 |title=About Us |publisher=State of Colorado |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009074137/http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/CDHS-BehavioralHealth/CBON/1251580690622 |archivedate=October 9, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Home of Heroes===\nPueblo is the hometown of four [[Medal of Honor]] recipients (more than any other municipality in the United States) - [[William J.

All you guys turn out to be heroes!\"\n\nIn 1993, Pueblo City Council adopted the tagline \"Home of Heroes\" for the city due to the fact that Pueblo can claim more recipients of the Medal per capita than any other city in the United States.

Such legislation originates as an [[Act of Congress]] passed by the [[United States Congress]]; such acts were either signed into law by the [[President of the United States|President]] or passed by Congress after a [[List of United States presidential vetoes|presidential veto]].\n\nHowever, legislation is not the only source of regulations.

The President can issue executive orders pursuant to a [[enabling act|grant of discretion]] from Congress, or under the inherent powers that office holds to deal with certain matters which have the [[Statutory law|force of law]].\n\nMany early executive orders were not recorded. The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] began numbering executive orders in the early 20th century, starting retroactively from President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s Executive Order [[s:Executive Order 1|Establishing a Provisional Court in Louisiana]] issued in 1862.<!--can someone, therefore provide EO Numbers for Emancipation Proclamation & Colville Indian Reservation?-->\n\n==Consolidated list by President==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Their outcrop reaches from Sudbury on the [[Norfolk]] border southwestwards to the [[Hertfordshire]] border at Bishop's Stortford. However the bedrock of the larger part of the county is formed by the silty clays and sandy clays of the succeeding [[Eocene]] age [[Harwich Formation]] which is ascribed to the [[Thames Group]].
