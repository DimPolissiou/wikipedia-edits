The club, founded in 2020 and elected to the League of Ireland in 1985, hails from [[Cobh]], [[County Cork]] and play their home matches at [[St. Colman's Park]]. The club's colours are claret and blue. The club was a founding member of the Cork AUL in 1947 and is the only one of the 14 founding clubs still in existence today.\n\nStephen Henderson guided them to the First Division title for the first time on 10 November 2007, which saw Cobh promoted to the top flight for the first time in 12 years.\n\nHenderson resigned at the end of the 2008 season after Ramblers were relegated from the Premier Division, wherethe battle went down to the last day and saw [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|UCD]], Ramblers and [[Finn Harps]] relegated. They subsequently failed to gain a licence for the [[League of Ireland First Division]] and thus played in the A Championship. In January 2013, the FAI awarded the club a First Division licence, thus regaining League status after a four-year absence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/domestic-a-grassroots/airtricity-league/news/102993-cobh-ramblers-awarded-a-2013-airtricity-league-first-division-licence.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127013529/http://www.fai.ie/domestic-a-grassroots/airtricity-league/news/102993-cobh-ramblers-awarded-a-2013-airtricity-league-first-division-licence.html |archivedate=27 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 January 2020\nit was revealed that [[Dave Hill (footballer)|Dave Hill]] would return to the club to replace Henderson as manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish-soccer-league/2009/0120/243853-hilld_cobh/ |title= Hill returns to manage Cobh |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[RT\u00c9 Sport]] |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\nThe club have a very successful under-2s  team. They won the under-19 Southern Division in the 2011\u201312 season and were promoted to the Elite Division.\n\nThe Football Association of Ireland on 24 January 2013 announced that Cobh Ramblers had been awarded a licence by the Independent Club Licensing Committee to compete in the 2013 Airtricity League First Division.\n\nStephen Henderson again resigned from his position as first team manager during the 2019 season. Henderson\u2019s assistant manager, Stuart Ashton was appointed interim manager following Stephen\u2019s departure and was announced as the full time first team manager on 9 September 2019.\n\n==History==\n\nCRFC was originally a [[field hockey]] club but until the [[United Kingdom|British]] withdrawal from [[Ireland]] many club members played football with the soldiers who were stationed at Cobh, leading to the Ramblers' eventual re-formation as a football club.\n\nRamblers played in the 1976 [[FAI League Cup]], reaching the semi finals.\n\nCobh Ramblers joined the [[League of Ireland]] in 1985, after many successful years as a Munster Senior League side. One of the most successful of those teams was the team of 1983, who got to the semi final of the [[FAI Cup]] humbling many senior clubs on the way. They met [[Sligo Rovers]] in the semi-final that year and captured the imagination of the Irish footballing public, drawing crowds of over 20,000 to [[Flower Lodge]] for the home games as St Colmans Park was too small. There were 3 replays until Sligo finally won 3\u20132 and went on to win the Cup.\n\nCobh won promotion to the Premier Division in 1988, after finishing First Division runners-up to [[Athlone Town]]. Lasting just one season in the top flight, they won promotion again at the end of the 1992\u201393 season, this time as runners-up to [[Galway United]]. A play-off win over [[Finn Harps]] saw Ramblers retain their Premier Division status at the end of the 1993\u201394 season, but the club were relegated in second-last place the following year.\n\nWith Ramblers having played all but four of their League of Ireland campaigns in the First Division, they rarely get to play their local rivals [[Cork City Football Club|Cork City]], a Premier Division team, with the two usually only being able to match up in pre-season friendlies and the occasional cup match, Cobh being the minnows in terms of [[League of Ireland]] experience.\n\nIn recent years, fan numbers have not been as high as they were during the glory days when Ramblers were in the top flight of Irish football and playing glamorous pre-season matches against the likes of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Though even with its lower attendance at home matches (usually about 600 or so, over 1000 for the 2008 season), the fans in attendance are loyal and take part in club fund-raisers and events as well as watching the match. It is hoped though that with a new younger generation becoming interested in the League of Ireland, due to promotion of the league and sport as a whole, that attendance and the fortunes of the club might improve.\n\nRamblers appeared on live television for the first time on Friday, 10 November 2006 in an away fixture at [[Galway United]], where they lost 1\u20130.\n\nOn 10 November 2007 Cobh Ramblers beat Athlone Town 1\u20130 in Lissywoollen in what was a tense and nervous display. This victory gave Cobh Ramblers their first piece of Senior Silverware and crowned them First Division Champions. During the 2007 season, with their young squad, they recorded a 27-game unbeaten run, keeping 22 clean sheets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish-soccer-league/2007/1112/224840-cobh/ |title=Cobh boss praises promotion winners |author= |date= |work= |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> Their points tally of 77 points was also a record for the league.\n\nHowever, after suffering relegation from the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]], Ramblers subsequently failed to obtain a licence for the First Division due to financial constraints and so compete in the [[A Championship|Newstalk A Championship]] (Ireland's third tier).\n\nIn 2010 Ramblers missed out on gaining promotion back to the [[League of Ireland]] losing to [[Salthill Devon]] in a play off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtricityleague.com/index.php/matchzone/first-division/match-reports/2499/2499 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101191159/http://www.airtricityleague.com/index.php/matchzone/first-division/match-reports/2499/2499 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 January 2013 |title=Salthill Devon secure 1st Division Status |date=6 November 2010 |publisher=www.airtricityleague.ie |accessdate=15 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Ramblers most noted past player is former Irish international and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] star [[Roy Keane]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/english-league/2008/1204/241947-keanertimeline/|title=Memorable events in Keane's career|author=|date=|work=|publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport|accessdate=15 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> while Irish international [[Stephen Ireland]] is a product of the Youth System. [[Westlife]] singer [[Nicky Byrne]], also a talented footballer who was on the books at [[Leeds United]], had a spell with the club too.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the club parted company with manager Dave Hill by mutual consent after five years. He was replaced by Martin Cambridge on an interim basis. In March 2015 Martin Cambridge tendered his resignation and Stephen Henderson returned to the club as first team manager. In Oct 2015 Stephen Henderson signed a new three-year contract with the club. In 2016 Henderson guided Ramblers to munster senior cup victory and to a 3rd-place finish in the first division. Cobh Ramblers were the only side to defeat first division champions Limerick that season and this coincided with a run of 5 victories in their last 5 league games to reach the play offs. They narrowly lost 3\u20132 on aggregate to Drogheda Utd despite overturning a 2\u20130 deficit in the return leg at United Park after only nine minutes.\n\nIn 2018 Ramblers reached the final of the EA Sports Cup Final. In the semi final they defeated Dundalk 1-0 at home with young striker Chris Hull scoring the winner. Despite beating Dundalk and denying the eventual champions a treble the rams lost the final away to Derry City 3-1\n\n==Stadium==\n\n[[St Colman's Park]] was redeveloped during the mid-2000s. Construction of a new state of the art changing facility and press office along with a new Chairman's office was completed in 2006 along with new floodlights and a 900-seater stand replacing the old shed.

The club, founded in 2020 and elected to the League of Ireland in 1985, hails from [[Cobh]], [[County Cork]] and play their home matches at [[St. Colman's Park]]. The club's colours are claret and blue. The club was a founding member of the Cork AUL in 1947 and is the only one of the 14 founding clubs still in existence today.\n\nStephen Henderson guided them to the First Division title for the first time on 10 November 2007, which saw Cobh promoted to the top flight for the first time in 12 years.\n\nHenderson resigned at the end of the 2008 season after Ramblers were relegated from the Premier Division, wherethe battle went down to the last day and saw [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|UCD]], Ramblers and [[Finn Harps]] relegated. They subsequently failed to gain a licence for the [[League of Ireland First Division]] and thus played in the A Championship. In January 2013, the FAI awarded the club a First Division licence, thus regaining League status after a four-year absence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/domestic-a-grassroots/airtricity-league/news/102993-cobh-ramblers-awarded-a-2013-airtricity-league-first-division-licence.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127013529/http://www.fai.ie/domestic-a-grassroots/airtricity-league/news/102993-cobh-ramblers-awarded-a-2013-airtricity-league-first-division-licence.html |archivedate=27 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 January 2020\nit was revealed that [[Dave Hill (footballer)|Dave Hill]] would return to the club to replace Henderson as manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish-soccer-league/2009/0120/243853-hilld_cobh/ |title= Hill returns to manage Cobh |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[RT\u00c9 Sport]] |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\nThe club have a very successful under-2s  team. They won the under-19 Southern Division in the 2011\u201312 season and were promoted to the Elite Division.\n\nThe Football Association of Ireland on 24 January 2013 announced that Cobh Ramblers had been awarded a licence by the Independent Club Licensing Committee to compete in the 2013 Airtricity League First Division.\n\nStephen Henderson again resigned from his position as first team manager during the 2019 season. Henderson\u2019s assistant manager, Stuart Ashton was appointed interim manager following Stephen\u2019s departure and was announced as the full time first team manager on 9 September 2019.\n\n==History==\n\nCRFC was originally a [[field hockey]] club but until the [[United Kingdom|British]] withdrawal from [[Ireland]] many club members played football with the soldiers who were stationed at Cobh, leading to the Ramblers' eventual re-formation as a football club.\n\nRamblers played in the 1976 [[FAI League Cup]], reaching the semi finals.\n\nCobh Ramblers joined the [[League of Ireland]] in 1985, after many successful years as a Munster Senior League side. One of the most successful of those teams was the team of 1983, who got to the semi final of the [[FAI Cup]] humbling many senior clubs on the way. They met [[Sligo Rovers]] in the semi-final that year and captured the imagination of the Irish footballing public, drawing crowds of over 20,000 to [[Flower Lodge]] for the home games as St Colmans Park was too small. There were 3 replays until Sligo finally won 3\u20132 and went on to win the Cup.\n\nCobh won promotion to the Premier Division in 1988, after finishing First Division runners-up to [[Athlone Town]]. Lasting just one season in the top flight, they won promotion again at the end of the 1992\u201393 season, this time as runners-up to [[Galway United]]. A play-off win over [[Finn Harps]] saw Ramblers retain their Premier Division status at the end of the 1993\u201394 season, but the club were relegated in second-last place the following year.\n\nWith Ramblers having played all but four of their League of Ireland campaigns in the First Division, they rarely get to play their local rivals [[Cork City Football Club|Cork City]], a Premier Division team, with the two usually only being able to match up in pre-season friendlies and the occasional cup match, Cobh being the minnows in terms of [[League of Ireland]] experience.\n\nIn recent years, fan numbers have not been as high as they were during the glory days when Ramblers were in the top flight of Irish football and playing glamorous pre-season matches against the likes of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Though even with its lower attendance at home matches (usually about 600 or so, over 1000 for the 2008 season), the fans in attendance are loyal and take part in club fund-raisers and events as well as watching the match. It is hoped though that with a new younger generation becoming interested in the League of Ireland, due to promotion of the league and sport as a whole, that attendance and the fortunes of the club might improve.\n\nRamblers appeared on live television for the first time on Friday, 10 November 2006 in an away fixture at [[Galway United]], where they lost 1\u20130.\n\nOn 10 November 2007 Cobh Ramblers beat Athlone Town 1\u20130 in Lissywoollen in what was a tense and nervous display. This victory gave Cobh Ramblers their first piece of Senior Silverware and crowned them First Division Champions. During the 2007 season, with their young squad, they recorded a 27-game unbeaten run, keeping 22 clean sheets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish-soccer-league/2007/1112/224840-cobh/ |title=Cobh boss praises promotion winners |author= |date= |work= |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> Their points tally of 77 points was also a record for the league.\n\nHowever, after suffering relegation from the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]], Ramblers subsequently failed to obtain a licence for the First Division due to financial constraints and so compete in the [[A Championship|Newstalk A Championship]] (Ireland's third tier).\n\nIn 2010 Ramblers missed out on gaining promotion back to the [[League of Ireland]] losing to [[Salthill Devon]] in a play off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtricityleague.com/index.php/matchzone/first-division/match-reports/2499/2499 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101191159/http://www.airtricityleague.com/index.php/matchzone/first-division/match-reports/2499/2499 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 January 2013 |title=Salthill Devon secure 1st Division Status |date=6 November 2010 |publisher=www.airtricityleague.ie |accessdate=15 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Ramblers most noted past player is former Irish international and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] star [[Roy Keane]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/english-league/2008/1204/241947-keanertimeline/|title=Memorable events in Keane's career|author=|date=|work=|publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport|accessdate=15 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> while Irish international [[Stephen Ireland]] is a product of the Youth System. [[Westlife]] singer [[Nicky Byrne]], also a talented footballer who was on the books at [[Leeds United]], had a spell with the club too.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the club parted company with manager Dave Hill by mutual consent after five years. He was replaced by Martin Cambridge on an interim basis. In March 2015 Martin Cambridge tendered his resignation and Stephen Henderson returned to the club as first team manager. In Oct 2015 Stephen Henderson signed a new three-year contract with the club. In 2016 Henderson guided Ramblers to munster senior cup victory and to a 3rd-place finish in the first division. Cobh Ramblers were the only side to defeat first division champions Limerick that season and this coincided with a run of 5 victories in their last 5 league games to reach the play offs. They narrowly lost 3\u20132 on aggregate to Drogheda Utd despite overturning a 2\u20130 deficit in the return leg at United Park after only nine minutes.\n\nIn 2018 Ramblers reached the final of the EA Sports Cup Final. In the semi final they defeated Dundalk 1-0 at home with young striker Chris Hull scoring the winner. Despite beating Dundalk and denying the eventual champions a treble the rams lost the final away to Derry City 3-1\n\n==Stadium==\n\n[[St Colman's Park]] was redeveloped during the mid-2000s. Construction of a new state of the art changing facility and press office along with a new Chairman's office was completed in 2006 along with new floodlights and a 900-seater stand replacing the old shed. The east stand, too has seen improvement with 450 new seats being installed.

After fleeing the labyrinth, Apollo dreams about the Oracle saying that he must save her even though it is a trap. When he wakes up, he finds himself in Grover's base. When Meg wakes up, they find the line from the prophecy, 'Demeter's daughter finds her ancient roots' to occur. Apollo and Grover go out to try to find [[Gleeson Hedge]] in an army store called Macro's Military Madness. They then find out that Macro, the store owner, is actually [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], working for Caligula. He attacks them with an army of automatons. By activating 'command sequence: [[Daedalus]] twenty three', they defeat Macro with his own robots. They then navigate the maze with enlisting the help of [[Piper McLean]] and [[Jason Grace]].After a raid on Caligula's fleet of ships and Jason dying, Apollo and Meg steal a pair of Caligula's sandals, which let people navigate the [[Labyrinth]]. Piper gets upset over Jason's death, so she does not help them any more. The next day, Grover, Meg and Apollo, using Caligula's [[shoes]], walk the Labyrinth.

It was released on September 24, 2019. The story is set at Camp Jupiter in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The story starts off with Apollo and Meg taking Jason's body to Camp Jupiter. On their way to Camp Jupiter, they are attacked by [[Eurynomos (daemon)|eurynomos]], but a girl with pink hair arrives with dryads and a faun and kills the Eurynomous. She then introduces herself as Lavinia and says she will take them to camp Jupiter. After that, all the dryads and fauns start to leave. But as the last faun, Don, tries to leave, Lavinia spots him and said that he will not leave because of what he is supposed to owe Lavinia for helping him. They carry Jason's tomb to the tunnel where she knows a shortcut to Camp Jupiter. After they enter the tunnel, they see Hazel fighting a Eurynomous. Apollo tries to sing a song to help Hazel, but is scratched in the belly by a Eurynomous, before Hazel kills it. She then sees Jason's coffin and is terrified because she had a dream about Jason being killed by Emperor Caligula. After that, the five carry Jason's tomb and arrive in Camp Jupiter where they are greeted by Frank Zhang and Reyna Ramirez Arellano while everyone watches Jason's coffin being carried. Apollo sings a song about his quest and everyone is touched. They all decide that they will carry on with Jason's plan which was to build temples to honor the gods.\n\nApollo then faints and has a dream about Caligula and Commodus discussing their plan about Camp Jupiter. Apollo finds himself in a bed where Meg explains that he had been asleep for about 1 day and a half. They later go to the senator where they select him, Meg, Lavinia and Hazel to go to for a mission. After they find out about the old ghost King and his plans, they get more scared for the camp. But they have a plan to help them and so another quest is issued. After Apollo and Meg return, they see the camp in the midst of a war. Frank (the other praetor of Rome) sacrifices himself holding his firewood killing Caligula along the way to save the other legionnaires. Apollo later kills Commodus in the grief of losing Frank. Arion rescues Frank who mysteriously survives death and Reyna A. Ramirez Arellano pledges herself to the goddess Diana (Artemis) and joins the Hunters. Dakota, son of Bacchus, passes away overnight due to wounds that he got in battle. He was the longtime Centurion of the Fifth Cohort. Don the faun also dies. He gets reincarnated into a [[laurus nobilis|laurel tree]], Apollo's tree of victory. Hazel is voted as the new Praetor of Camp Jupiter and Lavinia voted as Centurion of the Fifth Cohort.\n\nApollo receives his old Godly Bow as a gift from camp Jupiter and sets off to New York along with his companion Meg McCaffrey, after receiving the last and final prophecy from Ella and Tyson.
