A [[hash function]] is used to determine the location for each key, and its presence in the table (or the value associated with it) can be found by examining that cell of the table.

However, when both cells are already full, it will be necessary to move other keys to their second locations (or back to their first locations) to make room for the new key. A [[greedy algorithm]] is used: The new key is inserted in one of its two possible locations, \"kicking out\", that is, displacing, any key that might already reside in this location. This displaced key is then inserted in its alternative location, again kicking out any key that might reside there. The process continues in the same way until an empty position is found, completing the algorithm. However, it is possible for this insertion process to fail, by entering an [[infinite loop]] or by finding a very long chain (longer than a preset threshold that is [[logarithm]]ic in the table size). In this case, the hash table is rebuilt [[in-place algorithm|in-place]] using new [[hash function]]s:{{quote | text = There is no need to allocate new tables for the rehashing: We may simply run through the tables to delete and perform the usual insertion procedure on all keys found not to be at their intended position in the table. | sign = Pagh & Rodler | source = \"Cuckoo Hashing\"<ref name=Cuckoo/> }}\n\n==Theory==\nInsertions succeed in expected constant time,<ref name=\"Cuckoo\" /> even considering the possibility of having to rebuild the table, as long as the number of keys is kept below half of the capacity of the hash table, i.e., the [[Load factor (computer science)|load factor]] is below 50%.\n\nOne method of proving this uses the theory of [[random graph]]s: one may form an [[undirected graph]] called the \"cuckoo graph\" that has a vertex for each hash table location, and an edge for each hashed value, with the endpoints of the edge being the two possible locations of the value.

Some of these methods can also be used to reduce the failure rate of cuckoo hashing, causing rebuilds of the data structure to be much less frequent.\n\nGeneralizations of cuckoo hashing that use more than two alternative hash functions can be expected to utilize a larger part of the capacity of the hash table efficiently while sacrificing some lookup and insertion speed. Using just three hash functions increases the load to 91%.<ref name=\"mitzenmacher2009survey\">{{cite journal | last=Mitzenmacher | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Mitzenmacher|title=Some Open Questions Related to Cuckoo Hashing &#124; Proceedings of ESA 2009 | date=2009-09-09|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/esa2009.pdf | accessdate=2010-11-10 }}</ref>\nAnother generalization of cuckoo hashing, called ''blocked cuckoo hashing'' consists in using more than one key per bucket.

The stash, in this data structure, is an array of a constant number of keys, used to store keys that cannot successfully be inserted into the main hash table of the structure. This modification reduces the failure rate of cuckoo hashing to an inverse-polynomial function with an exponent that can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the stash size. However, larger stashes also mean slower searches for keys that are not present or are in the stash. A stash can be used in combination with more than two hash functions or with blocked cuckoo hashing to achieve both high load factors and small failure rates.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Kirsch | first1 = Adam\n | last2 = Mitzenmacher | first2 = Michael D.\n | last3 = Wieder | first3 = Udi\n | doi = 10.1137/080728743\n | issue = 4\n | journal = SIAM J.

In order to allow these fingerprints to be moved around within the cuckoo filter, without knowing the keys that they came from, the two locations of each fingerprint may be computed from each other by a bitwise [[exclusive or]] operation with the fingerprint, or with a hash of the fingerprint. This data structure forms an approximate set membership data structure with much the same properties as a [[Bloom filter]]: it can store the members of a set of keys, and test whether a query key is a member, with some chance of [[false positive]]s (queries that are incorrectly reported as being part of the set) but no [[false negative]]s. However, it improves on a Bloom filter in multiple respects: its memory usage is smaller by a constant factor, it has better [[locality of reference]], and (unlike Bloom filters) it allows for fast deletion of set elements with no additional storage penalty.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Fan | first1 = Bin\n | last2 = Andersen | first2 = Dave G.\n | last3 = Kaminsky | first3 = Michael\n | last4 = Mitzenmacher | first4 = Michael D. | author4-link = Michael Mitzenmacher\n | contribution = Cuckoo filter: Practically better than Bloom\n | doi = 10.1145/2674005.2674994\n | pages = 75\u201388\n | title = Proc. 10th ACM Int.

Moreover, the same theory also proves that the expected size of a [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of the cuckoo graph is small, ensuring that each insertion takes constant expected time.<ref>{{Cite conference|first=Reinhard|last=Kutzelnigg|url=https://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/proceedings/article/viewFile/dmAG0133/1710.pdf|conference=Fourth Colloquium on Mathematics and Computer Science|title=Bipartite random graphs and cuckoo hashing|series=Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science|year=2006|volume=AG|pages=403\u2013406}}</ref>\n\n==Practice==\nIn practice, cuckoo hashing is about 20\u201330% slower than [[linear probing]], which is the fastest of the common approaches.<ref name=\"Cuckoo\"/>\nThe reason is that cuckoo hashing often causes two cache misses per search, to check the two locations where a key might be stored, while linear probing usually causes only one cache miss per search.\nHowever, because of its worst case guarantees on search time, cuckoo hashing can still be valuable when [[Real-time computing|real-time response rates]] are required.\n\n== Example ==\nThe following hash functions are given:\n\n<math>h\\left(k\\right)=k\\mod 11</math><br/>\n<math>h'\\left(k\\right)=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{11}\\right\\rfloor\\mod 11</math>\n\n<div style=\"margin-right:1em\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! k !! h(k) !! h'(k)\n|-\n| 20 || 9 || 1\n|-\n| 50 || 6 || 4\n|-\n| 53 || 9 || 4\n|-\n| 75 || 9 || 6\n|-\n| 100 || 1 || 9\n|-\n| 67 || 1 || 6\n|-\n| 105 || 6 || 9\n|-\n| 3 || 3 || 0\n|-\n| 36 || 3 || 3\n|-\n| 39 || 6 || 3\n|}\n</div>\n\nColumns in the following two tables show the state of the hash tables over time as the elements are inserted.\n\n<div style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"11\" | 1. table for h(k)\n|-\n| || 20 || 50 || 53 || 75 || 100 || 67 || 105 || 3 || 36 || 39\n|-\n| 0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 1 ||  ||  ||  ||  || 100 || 67 || 67 || 67 || 67 || 100\n|-\n| 2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 3 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 3 || 36 || 36\n|-\n| 4 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 5 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 6 ||  || 50 || 50 || 50 || 50 || 50 || 105 || 105 || 105 || 50\n|-\n| 7 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|- \n| 8 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 9 || 20 || 20 || 53 || 75 || 75 || 75 || 53 || 53 || 53 || 75\n|}\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"11\" | 2. table for h'(k)\n|-\n| || 20 || 50 || 53 || 75 || 100 || 67 || 105 || 3 || 36 || 39\n|-\n| 0 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 3 || 3\n|-\n| 1 ||  ||  || 20 || 20 || 20 || 20 || 20 || 20 || 20 || 20\n|-\n| 2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 3 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 39\n|-\n| 4 ||  ||  ||  || 53 || 53 || 53 || 50 || 50 || 50 || 53\n|-\n| 5 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 6 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 75 || 75 || 75 || 67\n|-\n| 7 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 8 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n| 9 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 100 || 100 || 100 || 100 || 105\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Cycle ===\nIf you now wish to insert the element 6, then you get into a cycle.

Some of these methods can also be used to reduce the failure rate of cuckoo hashing, causing rebuilds of the data structure to be much less frequent.\n\nGeneralizations of cuckoo hashing that use more than two alternative hash functions can be expected to utilize a larger part of the capacity of the hash table efficiently while sacrificing some lookup and insertion speed. Using just three hash functions increases the load to 91%.<ref name=\"mitzenmacher2009survey\">{{cite journal | last=Mitzenmacher | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Mitzenmacher|title=Some Open Questions Related to Cuckoo Hashing &#124; Proceedings of ESA 2009 | date=2009-09-09|url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/esa2009.pdf | accessdate=2010-11-10 }}</ref>\nAnother generalization of cuckoo hashing, called ''blocked cuckoo hashing'' consists in using more than one key per bucket. Using just 2 keys per bucket permits a load factor above 80%.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Dietzfelbinger | first1 = Martin\n | last2 = Weidling | first2 = Christoph\n | doi = 10.1016/j.tcs.2007.02.054\n | issue = 1\u20132\n | journal = Theoret.

The stash, in this data structure, is an array of a constant number of keys, used to store keys that cannot successfully be inserted into the main hash table of the structure. This modification reduces the failure rate of cuckoo hashing to an inverse-polynomial function with an exponent that can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the stash size. However, larger stashes also mean slower searches for keys that are not present or are in the stash. A stash can be used in combination with more than two hash functions or with blocked cuckoo hashing to achieve both high load factors and small failure rates.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Kirsch | first1 = Adam\n | last2 = Mitzenmacher | first2 = Michael D.\n | last3 = Wieder | first3 = Udi\n | doi = 10.1137/080728743\n | issue = 4\n | journal = SIAM J.

In order to allow these fingerprints to be moved around within the cuckoo filter, without knowing the keys that they came from, the two locations of each fingerprint may be computed from each other by a bitwise [[exclusive or]] operation with the fingerprint, or with a hash of the fingerprint. This data structure forms an approximate set membership data structure with much the same properties as a [[Bloom filter]]: it can store the members of a set of keys, and test whether a query key is a member, with some chance of [[false positive]]s (queries that are incorrectly reported as being part of the set) but no [[false negative]]s. However, it improves on a Bloom filter in multiple respects: its memory usage is smaller by a constant factor, it has better [[locality of reference]], and (unlike Bloom filters) it allows for fast deletion of set elements with no additional storage penalty.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Fan | first1 = Bin\n | last2 = Andersen | first2 = Dave G.\n | last3 = Kaminsky | first3 = Michael\n | last4 = Mitzenmacher | first4 = Michael D. | author4-link = Michael Mitzenmacher\n | contribution = Cuckoo filter: Practically better than Bloom\n | doi = 10.1145/2674005.2674994\n | pages = 75\u201388\n | title = Proc. 10th ACM Int.

Demand for Maicolettas in the U.K. was such that the importer used its inventory of spare parts to build new Maicolettas to special order until late 1967.<ref name=\"OpferMaicoletta\" />\n\n==Specifications==\n===Frame and suspension===\nThe Maicoletta had a tubular steel frame with pressed steel body panels.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" />  Front suspension was with a telescopic fork with coil springs, hydraulic damping, and a steering damper.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" />  Rear suspension was with a swingarm with dual coil springs and twin hydraulic dampers.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />  The wheels were 14&nbsp;inches in diameter<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" /> and had a width between 3.25&nbsp;inches<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /> and 3.5&nbsp;inches.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" />  Drum brakes were used front and rear.

When activated, instead of rotating the crankshaft, the starter used the generator coils on the shaft to rock it back and forth under the control of cams on the crankshaft.

Its disadvantage is the unusually large number of contacts, which can be difficult to adjust. The reversing switch contacts tend to wear out with extended use and can be very difficult to service or to have serviced, hence the scooter's reputation for requiring roll starts later in life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The Maicoletta did not have a kick starter.<ref name=\"CWMar63\" />\n\n===Ergonomics===\nThe Maicoletta was noted for being large and comfortable,<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" /> with an exceptionally large and commodious dual seat<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /> and room for the rider and passenger to move around and avoid fatigue.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />\n\n[[File:Maicoletta_dashboard.jpg|thumb|left|Maicoletta Dash]]\nThe Maicoletta had a dashboard with a speedometer and an eight-day clock.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />  A gear ratio indicator was incorporated in the speedometer.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />  \n\nThe drivetrain was covered by the rear bodywork, which could be removed as a unit by loosening one bolt and unplugging the lead to the taillight.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /> Access to the fuel cap and the spark plug was also available by unlocking and lifting the hinged seat,<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /> and an access panel on the left side allowed access to the carburettor.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" />\n\nOne ergonomic concern was the considerable effort required to mount the Maicoletta on its centre stand.

The reversing switch contacts tend to wear out with extended use and can be very difficult to service or to have serviced, hence the scooter's reputation for requiring roll starts later in life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The Maicoletta did not have a kick starter.<ref name=\"CWMar63\" />\n\n===Ergonomics===\nThe Maicoletta was noted for being large and comfortable,<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" /> with an exceptionally large and commodious dual seat<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /> and room for the rider and passenger to move around and avoid fatigue.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />\n\n[[File:57maicolettadash.jpg|thumb|left|Maicoletta Dash]]\nThe Maicoletta had a dashboard with a speedometer and an eight-day clock.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />  A gear ratio indicator was incorporated in the speedometer.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" /><ref name=\"CWMar63\" />  \n\nThe drivetrain was covered by the rear bodywork, which could be removed as a unit by loosening one bolt and unplugging the lead to the taillight.<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /> Access to the fuel cap and the spark plug was also available by unlocking and lifting the hinged seat,<ref name=\"MCAug56\" /><ref name=\"SWMay60\" /> and an access panel on the left side allowed access to the carburettor.<ref name=\"SWMay60\" />\n\nOne ergonomic concern was the considerable effort required to mount the Maicoletta on its centre stand.

However, clear pictorial evidence of the drum emerges only from about 1745, and the drum continued to develop in shape until the early 1800s.<ref name=\"Kippen 2000\">{{cite book|author=James Kippen|title=Hindustani Tala, Garland Encyclopedia of World Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hh03DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT263&dq=kippen+origins+of+tabla&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4_fXlvorgAhXMneAKHZqZCxoQ6wEIPTAD#v=onepage&q=%20origins%20of%20tabla&f=false|year=1999|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n===Turk-Arab origins===\nThe first theory, very common during the colonial period scholarship, is based on the etymological links of the word ''tabla'' to Arabic word ''tabl'' which means \"drum\". Beyond the root of the word, this proposal points to the abundant documentary evidence that the Muslim armies, as they invaded the Indian subcontinent, had hundreds of soldiers on camels and horses carrying paired drums. They would beat these drums to scare the residents, the non-Muslim armies, their elephants and chariots, that they intended to attack. [[Babur]], the Turk founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], is known to have used these paired drums carrying battalions in their military campaigns. However, this theory has had the flaw that the war drums did not look or sound anything like ''tabla'', they were large paired drums and were called ''naqqara'' (noise, chaos makers).<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe second version of the Arab theory is that Amir Khusraw, a musician patronized by Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] invented the ''tabla'' when he cut an ''Awaj drum'', which used to be hourglass shaped. This is, however, unlikely, as no painting or sculpture or document dated to his period supports it with evidence. If ''tabla'' had arrived, or had been invented under Arabic influence from the root word ''tabl'', it would be in the list of musical instruments that were written down by Muslim historians, but such evidence is also absent. For example, Abul Fazi included a long list of musical instruments in his ''Ain-i-akbari'' written in the time of the 16th century Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], the generous patron of music. Abul Fazi's list makes no mention of ''tabla''.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe third version of the Arab theory credits the invention of ''tabla'' to the 18th century musician, with a similar sounding name Amir Khusru, where he is suggested to have cut a ''[[Pakhawaj]]'' into two to create ''tabla''. This is not an entirely unreasonable theory, and miniature paintings of this era show instruments that sort of look like ''tabla'', but this would mean that ''tabla'' emerged from within the Muslim community of Indian subcontinent and were not an Arabian import.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/><ref name=\"Lavezzoli2006p37\">{{cite book|author=Peter Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA37|year=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1815-9|pages=37\u201339}}</ref> However, scholars such as Neil Sorrell and Ram Narayan state that this legend of cutting a ''pakhawaj'' drum into two to make ''tabla'' drums \"cannot be given any credence\".<ref name=\"SorrellNarayan1980p40\"/>\n\n===Indian origins===\n[[File:Five Celestial Musicians LACMA AC1992.254.1-.5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Five Gandharvas (celestial musicians) from 4th-5th century CE.

Small drums were popular during the [[Seuna dynasty|Yadava rule]] (1210 to 1247) in the south, at the time when [[Sangita Ratnakara]] was written by [[Sarangadeva]].  [[Madhava Kandali]], 14th century [[Assamese people|Assamese]] poet and writer of [[Saptakanda Ramayana]], lists several instruments in his version of ''\"Ramayana\"'', such as tabal, [[Anklet|jhajhar]], [[dotara]], [[Veena|vina]], [[Rudra veena|rudra-vipanchi]], etc. (meaning that these instruments existed since his time in 14th century or earlier).There is recent iconography of the tabla dating back to 1799.<ref>[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/solvyns-project/solvynsonline/pages/Calcutta160.html][[Frans Balthazar Solvyns]]<span>, </span>''A Collection of Two Hundred and Fifty Coloured Etchings'' (1799)</ref> This theory is now obsolete with iconography carvings found in Bhaje caves providing solid proof that the tabla was used in ancient India.

Unpublished thesis, UCLA, 1974</ref>\n\n==Construction and features==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2009}}\nThe smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is sometimes called dayan (literally \"right\" side ), d\u0101hina, siddha or chatt\u016b, but is correctly called the \"tabla.\" It is made from a conical piece of mostly [[teak]] and [[rosewood]] hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth. The drum is tuned to a specific note, usually either the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] or [[subdominant]] of the soloist's key and thus complements the [[melody]]. The tuning range is limited although different d\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s are produced in different sizes, each with a different range. Cylindrical wood blocks, known as gatta, are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning. Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small, heavy hammer.\n\nThe larger drum, played with the other hand, is called b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 (literally \"left\") dugg\u012b or dh\u0101m\u0101 (correctly called \"dagga\"), has a much deeper [[bass (sound)|bass]] [[timbre|tone]], much like its distant cousin, the [[kettle drum]]. The b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 may be made of any of a number of materials.  Brass is the most common, copper is more expensive, but generally held to be the best, while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models. Sometimes wood is used, especially in old b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s from the Punjab. Clay is also used, although not favored for durability; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal.\n\nThe name of the head areas are:\n* chat, chanti, kinar, kinar,\n* sur, maidan, lao, luv, medan\n* center: syahi, siaahi, gab\n\nThe [[drumhead|head]] of each drum has a central area of \"tuning paste\" called the [[syahi]] (lit. \"ink\"; a.k.a. ''sh\u0101\u012b'' or ''g\u0101b''). This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch (rice or wheat) mixed with a black powder of various origins. The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drum's natural overtones, resulting in the clarity of pitch (see [[inharmonicity]]) and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument which has a bell-like sound. The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument.\n\nFor stability while playing, each drum is positioned on a [[toroid]]al bundle called ''chutta'' or ''guddi'', consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth.\n\n==Musical notation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\nIndian music is traditionally practice-oriented and until the 20th century did not employ written notations as the primary media of instruction, understanding, or transmission. The rules of Indian music and compositions themselves are taught from a guru to a shishya, in person. Thus oral notation, such as the tabla stroke names, is very developed and exact. However, written notation is regarded as a matter of taste and is not standardized. Thus there is no universal system of written notation for the rest of the world to study Indian music.\n\nMaula Bakhsh (born as Chole Khan in 1833) was an Indian musician, singer and poet. His grandson was [[Inayat Khan]], founder of Universal Sufism. He developed the \"first system of notation for Indian music\". He also founded the \"first Academy of Music in India\" in 1886, based in Baroda that encompassed both Eastern and Western musical cultural traditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Qs7TD4n4sC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=indian+classical+notation+system&source=bl&ots=-KHKSwF4jg&sig=EbOof4YvukGosWMnpuCJbojxaxA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sJ3RUZOkI6n20gXDkIHoCw&ved=0CHUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Two Men and Music : Nationalism in the Making of an Indian Classical ... \u2013 Janaki Bakhle Assistant Professor of History Columbia University \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2005-09-17 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Basic strokes==\n[[File:Ustad Zakir Hussain 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Ustad Zakir Hussain]] performing at [[Konark]], [[Odisha]]]]\nSome basic strokes with the dayan on the right side and the bayan on the left side are:\n\n*Ta: (on dayan) striking sharply with the index finger against the rim while simultaneously applying gentle pressure to the edge of the syahi with the ring finger to suppress the fundamental vibration mode\n*Ghe or ga: (on bayan) holding wrist down and arching the fingers over the syahi; the middle and ring-fingers then strike the maidan (resonant)\n*gha (on bayan) striking the index finger\n*Tin: (on dayan) placing the last two fingers of the right hand lightly against the syahi and striking on the border between the syahi and the maidan (resonant)\n*Dha: combination of Na and (Ga or Gha)\n*Dhin: combination of Tin and (Ga or Gha)\n*Ka or kath: (on bayan) striking with the flat palm and fingers (non resonant)\n*Na: (on dayan) striking the edge of the syahi with the last two fingers of the right hand\n*Te: (on dayan) striking the center of the syahi with the middle finger (non resonant)\n*Tu | Tun:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandrakantha.com/tablasite/bsicbols.htm#Tu|title=Basic Technique of Tabla bols: Dhaa, Dhin, Ga, Ka, Naa, Na, Taa, Tak,TiRaKiTa, Tin, Tu, etc.|first=Todd A.

Beyond the root of the word, this proposal points to the abundant documentary evidence that the Muslim armies, as they invaded the Indian subcontinent, had hundreds of soldiers on camels and horses carrying paired drums. They would beat these drums to scare the residents, the non-Muslim armies, their elephants and chariots, that they intended to attack. [[Babur]], the Turk founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], is known to have used these paired drums carrying battalions in their military campaigns. However, this theory has had the flaw that the war drums did not look or sound anything like ''tabla'', they were large paired drums and were called ''naqqara'' (noise, chaos makers).<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe second version of the Arab theory is that Amir Khusraw, a musician patronized by Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] invented the ''tabla'' when he cut an ''Awaj drum'', which used to be hourglass shaped. This is, however, unlikely, as no painting or sculpture or document dated to his period supports it with evidence. If ''tabla'' had arrived, or had been invented under Arabic influence from the root word ''tabl'', it would be in the list of musical instruments that were written down by Muslim historians, but such evidence is also absent. For example, Abul Fazi included a long list of musical instruments in his ''Ain-i-akbari'' written in the time of the 16th century Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], the generous patron of music. Abul Fazi's list makes no mention of ''tabla''.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe third version of the Arab theory credits the invention of ''tabla'' to the 18th century musician, with a similar sounding name Amir Khusru, where he is suggested to have cut a ''[[Pakhawaj]]'' into two to create ''tabla''. This is not an entirely unreasonable theory, and miniature paintings of this era show instruments that sort of look like ''tabla'', but this would mean that ''tabla'' emerged from within the Muslim community of Indian subcontinent and were not an Arabian import.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/><ref name=\"Lavezzoli2006p37\">{{cite book|author=Peter Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA37|year=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1815-9|pages=37\u201339}}</ref> However, scholars such as Neil Sorrell and Ram Narayan state that this legend of cutting a ''pakhawaj'' drum into two to make ''tabla'' drums \"cannot be given any credence\".<ref name=\"SorrellNarayan1980p40\"/>\n\n===Indian origins===\n[[File:Five Celestial Musicians LACMA AC1992.254.1-.5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Five Gandharvas (celestial musicians) from 4th-5th century CE.

Small drums were popular during the [[Seuna dynasty|Yadava rule]] (1210 to 1247) in the south, at the time when [[Sangita Ratnakara]] was written by [[Sarangadeva]].  [[Madhava Kandali]], 14th century [[Assamese people|Assamese]] poet and writer of [[Saptakanda Ramayana]], lists several instruments in his version of ''\"Ramayana\"'', such as tabal, [[Anklet|jhajhar]], [[dotara]], [[Veena|vina]], [[Rudra veena|rudra-vipanchi]], etc. (meaning that these instruments existed since his time in 14th century or earlier).There is recent iconography of the tabla dating back to 1799.<ref>[http://www.laits.utexas.edu/solvyns-project/solvynsonline/pages/Calcutta160.html][[Frans Balthazar Solvyns]]<span>, </span>''A Collection of Two Hundred and Fifty Coloured Etchings'' (1799)</ref> This theory is now obsolete with iconography carvings found in Bhaje caves providing solid proof that the tabla was used in ancient India.

Unpublished thesis, UCLA, 1974</ref>\n\n==Construction and features==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2009}}\nThe smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is sometimes called dayan (literally \"right\" side ), d\u0101hina, siddha or chatt\u016b, but is correctly called the \"tabla.\" It is made from a conical piece of mostly [[teak]] and [[rosewood]] hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth. The drum is tuned to a specific note, usually either the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] or [[subdominant]] of the soloist's key and thus complements the [[melody]]. The tuning range is limited although different d\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s are produced in different sizes, each with a different range. Cylindrical wood blocks, known as gatta, are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning. Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small, heavy hammer.\n\nThe larger drum, played with the other hand, is called b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 (literally \"left\") dugg\u012b or dh\u0101m\u0101 (correctly called \"dagga\"), has a much deeper [[bass (sound)|bass]] [[timbre|tone]], much like its distant cousin, the [[kettle drum]]. The b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 may be made of any of a number of materials.  Brass is the most common, copper is more expensive, but generally held to be the best, while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models. Sometimes wood is used, especially in old b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s from the Punjab. Clay is also used, although not favored for durability; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal.\n\nThe name of the head areas are:\n* chat, chanti, kinar, kinar,\n* sur, maidan, lao, luv, medan\n* center: syahi, siaahi, gab\n\nThe [[drumhead|head]] of each drum has a central area of \"tuning paste\" called the [[syahi]] (lit. \"ink\"; a.k.a. ''sh\u0101\u012b'' or ''g\u0101b''). This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch (rice or wheat) mixed with a black powder of various origins. The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drum's natural overtones, resulting in the clarity of pitch (see [[inharmonicity]]) and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument which has a bell-like sound. The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument.\n\nFor stability while playing, each drum is positioned on a [[toroid]]al bundle called ''chutta'' or ''guddi'', consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth.\n\n==Musical notation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\nIndian music is traditionally practice-oriented and until the 20th century did not employ written notations as the primary media of instruction, understanding, or transmission. The rules of Indian music and compositions themselves are taught from a guru to a shishya, in person. Thus oral notation, such as the tabla stroke names, is very developed and exact. However, written notation is regarded as a matter of taste and is not standardized. Thus there is no universal system of written notation for the rest of the world to study Indian music.\n\nMaula Bakhsh (born as Chole Khan in 1833) was an Indian musician, singer and poet. His grandson was [[Inayat Khan]], founder of Universal Sufism. He developed the \"first system of notation for Indian music\". He also founded the \"first Academy of Music in India\" in 1886, based in Baroda that encompassed both Eastern and Western musical cultural traditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Qs7TD4n4sC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=indian+classical+notation+system&source=bl&ots=-KHKSwF4jg&sig=EbOof4YvukGosWMnpuCJbojxaxA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sJ3RUZOkI6n20gXDkIHoCw&ved=0CHUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Two Men and Music : Nationalism in the Making of an Indian Classical ... \u2013 Janaki Bakhle Assistant Professor of History Columbia University \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2005-09-17 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Basic strokes==\n[[File:Ustad Zakir Hussain 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Ustad Zakir Hussain]] performing at [[Konark]], [[Odisha]]]]\nSome basic strokes with the dayan on the right side and the bayan on the left side are:\n\n*Ta: (on dayan) striking sharply with the index finger against the rim while simultaneously applying gentle pressure to the edge of the syahi with the ring finger to suppress the fundamental vibration mode\n*Ghe or ga: (on bayan) holding wrist down and arching the fingers over the syahi; the middle and ring-fingers then strike the maidan (resonant)\n*gha (on bayan) striking the index finger\n*Thin: (on dayan) placing the last two fingers of the right hand lightly against the syahi and striking on the border between the syahi and the maidan (resonant)\n*Dha: combination of Na and (Ga or Gha)\n*Dhin: combination of Tin and (Ga or Gha)\n*Ka or kath: (on bayan) striking with the flat palm and fingers (non resonant)\n*Na: (on dayan) striking the edge of the syahi with the last two fingers of the right hand\n*Te: (on dayan) striking the center of the syahi with the middle finger (non resonant)\n*Tu | Tun:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandrakantha.com/tablasite/bsicbols.htm#Tu|title=Basic Technique of Tabla bols: Dhaa, Dhin, Ga, Ka, Naa, Na, Taa, Tak,TiRaKiTa, Tin, Tu, etc.|first=Todd A.

He and his younger brother [[Art Powell (wide receiver)|Art Powell]], an NFL wide receiver for the New York Titans and [[Oakland Raiders]] in the 1960s, grew up in the Logan Heights area of [[San Diego, California]].\n\nPowell played professional baseball and football as well as boxed.  His greatest success was as an NFL player and a boxer, even boxing against Muhammad Ali.\n\n==High school==\nCharlie starred in football, basketball, track and baseball at [[San Diego High School]]. In 1950, as a 6'-3\", 230-pound defensive end and offensive end, with tremendous power and speed, he was named the California high school football player of the year. In track, he ran 100 yards in 9.6 seconds and threw the [[shot put]] 57 feet 9\u00bc inches.  In basketball, he was a second-team all-league center.  As a high school baseball player, he hit balls out of San Diego Balboa Stadium.  He turned a down an offer of a tryout by the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].\n\n==Baseball career==\nAfter high school, Charlie was recruited by Notre Dame and UCLA to play football, [[St. Louis Browns]] baseball owner [[Bill Veeck]], who had acquired the legendary pitcher [[Satchel Paige]] from the [[Cleveland Indians]], signed the power-hitting outfielder to a professional baseball contract. He was sent to the Stockton Ports, a Class B minor league team.\n\n==Football career==\nBut after playing pro baseball in the summer of 1952, Charlie suddenly abandoned his pro baseball career and signed a pro football contract with the San Francisco 49ers. At 19, he became the youngest player in NFL history. In his first game, he started against the NFL champion Detroit Lions and had multiple sacks against QB Bobby Layne, totalling 67 yards in sack yardage.\n\nPowell played five seasons in the NFL for the 49ers (1952\u201353 and 1955\u201357) and two for the Oakland Raiders (1960\u201361).\n\n==Boxing career==\nPowell was also a professional boxer.  In March 1959, on television, he knocked out [[Nino Valdes]] of Cuba who was the number 2 ranked heavyweight fighter in the world at the time. He fought [[Muhammad Ali]] (who was then known as Cassius Clay) at the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh]] on January 24, 1963. Ali knocked out Powell in the third round, as Ali predicted before the fight. He finished his pro boxing career with a record of 25-11-3.  In his career, Charlie also fought [[Floyd Patterson]], losing to him in 6 rounds.\n\n==Retirement==\nPowell is a member of the Breitbard San Diego Hall of Fame.

{"title_page": "Communication privacy management theory", "text_new": "'''Communication privacy management''' ('''CPM'''), originally known as '''communication boundary management''', is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by [[Sandra Petronio]] in 1991.\n\nPetronio uses a boundary [[metaphor]] to explain the privacy management process. '''[[#Private boundaries|Privacy boundaries]]''' draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a [[#Rule-based management system|rule-based management system]] to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her\n[[self-disclosure]]s. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A\ndistressing sense of \"[[#Boundary turbulence|boundary turbulence]]\" can arise when\nclashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:\n\n(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.\n\n== Background ==\nPetronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical\nconception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication Privacy Management in Electronic Commerce|last = |first = |date = 2001|journal = }}</ref> Altman and Taylor's [[social penetration theory]] focused on [[self-disclosure]] as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called ''communication boundary management''. In 2002, she renamed it to ''communication privacy management'', underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.\n\n==Assumptions==\n* Humans are choice-makers\n* Humans are rule-makers and rule-followers\n* Humans' choices and rules are based on a consideration of others as well as the self\n* Relational life is characterized by change\n* Contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.|isbn=9780073534282|edition=Fifth|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}</ref>\n\n==Theory elements==\n\n=== Private information ===\n[[File:CPM Basic Suppositions.png|thumb|230x230px]]\nThe content of concealing and revealing is private information.

Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information.<ref name=\"Petronio, et al. 19982\">{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Ellmers | first2 = N. | last3 = Giles | first3 = H. | last4 = Gallois | first4 = C. | year = 1998 | title = (Mis)communicating across boundaries: Interpersonal and intergroup considerations | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 571\u2013595 }}</ref> When private information is shared, there will be a '''collective boundary'''. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a '''personal boundary'''. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).\n[[File:Personal and Collective Boundaries.jpg.png|thumb|Personal and collective boundaries]]\n\n=== Control and ownership ===\nCommunication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]] <nowiki/>of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.<ref name=\"Petronio, Durham 20082\">Petronio, S., & Durham, W.T.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.\n</ref>\n\n=== Rule-based management system===\n[[File:Three processes.jpg.png|thumb|right]]\n\nAs the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.\n\n=== Management dialectics ===\n[[File:Boundaries in a Life Span.png|thumb|224x224px]]\nPetronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread.<ref name=\"Petronio, Rierson 2009\">Petronio, S., & Reierson, J.

The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship,were weighed using multiple viewpoints.<ref name=\"Baxter, Montgomery 1996\">Baxter, L.A., & Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating Dialogues and dialectics: New York: Guilford Press.</ref>\n\n== Rule-based management system ==\nPetronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.\n\n===Privacy rule characteristics===\nThe characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules.<ref name=\"Petronio 1991\">Petronio, S. (1991). Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples. [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]], 1, 311\u2013335.</ref> This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared.<ref name=\"Petronio 20072\">{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S | year = 2007 | title = Translational Research Endeavors and the Practices of Communication Privacy Management | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 218\u2013222 }}</ref> Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\nDecision Criteria\n!\nCategory\n!\nDefinition\n!\nExample\n|-\n|''Cultural ''\n|core \n|Disclosure depends on the norms for privacy and openness in a given culture.\n|The United States favors more openness in relational communication than does Japan\n|-\n|''Gender''\n|core \n|Privacy boundaries are sculpted differently by men and women based on socialization, which leads to difference in how rules are understood and operated in\n|American women are socialized to be more disclosive than men\n|-\n|''Context ''\n|catalyst\n|Shaped by issues of physical and social environments that factor in whether or not information will be shared\n|If we're in a traumatic situation (e.g., we've survived an earthquake together), we'll develop new rules\n|-\n|''Motivation ''\n|catalyst\n|Owners of information can form certain bonds that lead to disclosure, or conversely the express interest in forming bonds may cause private information to be shared. Motivations for sharing can include reciprocity or self-clarification.\n|If you have disclosed a great deal to me, out of reciprocity, I might be motivated to disclose to you\n|-\n|''Risk/benefit ratio ''\n|catalyst\n|Owners of private information evaluate risks relative to the benefits of disclosure or maintaining information private. \n|Our rules are influenced by our assessment of the ratio of risks to benefits of disclosing\n|}\nWith these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.\n\n===Boundary coordination===\nAn individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership.<ref name=\"Petronio 1991\" /> Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information.<ref name=\"Petronio 20072\"/> By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.  \n*'''''Boundary permeability''''' refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered ''thin''.<ref name=\"Petronio, Durham 20082\"/>\n*'''''Boundary linkage''''' has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.<ref name=\"Caughlin, Afifi 2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = Caughlin | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Afifi | first2 = T.D. | year = 2004 | title = When is topic avoidance unsatisfying?

When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared.<ref name=\"Petronio 1991\" /> A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined.\n\n===Boundary turbulence===\nOften, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners \u2013 this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. [[Clear-air turbulence|Turbulence]] among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had,<ref name=\"Petronio 20022\"/> which can happen for a number of reasons.\n\nBoundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.\n\nIn addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information.<ref name=\"Afifi 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = T. D. | year = 2003 | title = Feeling caught\" in stepfamilies: managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 729\u2013755 | doi=10.1177/0265407503206002}}</ref> An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.\n\nLastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of [[social media]] and, in particular, [[Facebook]], boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and [[Friending|\"friend\"]] their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kanter |first1=M. |last2=Robbins |first2=S. |title=The Impact of Parents \"Friending\" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent-Child Relationship Quality |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2012 |page=900 of 917 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x |volume=62|issue=5 }}</ref>\n\nIn cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners.

The research found that couples frame miscarriage as a shared but distinct experience and that both members exert rights of ownership over the information. Couples' privacy rules centered on issues of social support and others' need to know about the loss.

The concept of [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]] has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Seumas|last2=Weckert|first2=John|title=Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=December 2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=255\u2013265|doi=10.1023/a:1006232417265}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|last2=Voas|first2=J.|last3=Hurlburt|first3=G.F.|title=BYOD: Security and Privacy Considerations|journal=IT Professional|date=Sep\u2013Oct 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=53\u201355|doi=10.1109/mitp.2012.93}}</ref>\nEven before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing.

This \"study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a \"free space\" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care.

Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.\n\n[[Social penetration theory]] explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.\n\nFinally, [[coordinated management of meaning]] explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.\n\n==Academic integration==\nCommunication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Critique==\n\n=== Values ===\n\nAltman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different \"levels\" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure \"turbulence\", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.<ref name=\"Afifi 2003\" /><ref name=\"Petronio, Martin 1986\">{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Martin | first2 = J.N. | year = 1986 | title = Ramifications of revealing private information: A gender gap | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 499\u2013506 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198605)42:3<499::aid-jclp2270420317>3.0.co;2-i}}</ref><ref name=\"Petronio, Martin, Litlefield 1984\">{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S.

It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms ''balance'' and ''equilibrium'' in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. \"Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the ''degrees'' [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction\" (pp.&nbsp;12\u201313). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Privacy]]\n*[[Self-disclosure]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Communication theory|Privacy management theory]]\n[[Category:Interpersonal communication]]\n[[Category:Privacy]]\n", "text_old": "'''Communication privacy management''' ('''CPM'''), originally known as '''communication boundary management''', is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by [[Sandra Petronio]] in 1991.\n\nPetronio uses a boundary [[metaphor]] to explain the privacy management process. '''[[#Private boundaries|Privacy boundaries]]''' draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a [[#Rule-based management system|rule-based management system]] to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her\n[[self-disclosure]]s. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A\ndistressing sense of \"[[#Boundary turbulence|boundary turbulence]]\" can arise when\nclashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:\n\n(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.\n\n== Background ==\nPetronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical\nconception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication Privacy Management in Electronic Commerce|last = |first = |date = 2001|journal = }}</ref> Altman and Taylor's [[social penetration theory]] focused on [[self-disclosure]] as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called ''communication boundary management''. In 2002, she renamed it to ''communication privacy management'', underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.\n\n==Assumptions==\n* Humans are choice-makers\n* Humans are rule-makers and rule-followers\n* Humans' choices and rules are based on a consideration of others as well as the self\n* Relational life is characterized by change\n* Contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.|isbn=9780073534282|edition=Fifth|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}</ref>\n\n==Theory elements==\n\n=== Private information ===\n[[File:CPM Basic Suppositions.png|thumb|230x230px]]\nThe content of concealing and revealing is private information.

Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information.<ref name=\"Petronio, et al. 19982\">Petronio, S., Ellmers, N., Giles, H., Gallois, C. (1998). (Mis)communicating across boundaries: Interpersonal and intergroup considerations. Communication Research, 25, 571\u2013595.\n</ref> When private information is shared, there will be a '''collective boundary'''. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a '''personal boundary'''. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).\n[[File:Personal and Collective Boundaries.jpg.png|thumb|Personal and collective boundaries]]\n\n=== Control and ownership ===\nCommunication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]] <nowiki/>of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.<ref name=\"Petronio, Durham 20082\">Petronio, S., & Durham, W.T.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.\n</ref>\n\n=== Rule-based management system===\n[[File:Three processes.jpg.png|thumb|right]]\n\nAs the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.\n\n=== Management dialectics ===\n[[File:Boundaries in a Life Span.png|thumb|224x224px]]\nPetronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread.<ref name=\"Petronio, Rierson 2009\">Petronio, S., & Reierson, J. (2009). Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities through Communication Privacy Management Theory. Uncertainty, Information Management, and Disclosure Decisions: Theories and Applications. 365\u2013383.</ref> The definition of [[dialectic]] that Petronio borrows from can be found in Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery's theory of [[relational dialectics]], wherein various approaches to the contradictory impulses of relational life are discussed. The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship,were weighed using multiple viewpoints.<ref name=\"Baxter, Montgomery 1996\">Baxter, L.A., & Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating Dialogues and dialectics: New York: Guilford Press.</ref>\n\n== Rule-based management system ==\nPetronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.\n\n===Privacy rule characteristics===\nThe characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules.<ref name=\"Petronio 1991\">Petronio, S. (1991). Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples. [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]], 1, 311\u2013335.</ref> This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared.<ref name=\"Petronio 20072\">Petronio, S. (2007). Translational Research Endeavors and the Practices of Communication Privacy Management. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 35, 218-222.\n</ref> Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\nDecision Criteria\n!\nCategory\n!\nDefinition\n!\nExample\n|-\n|''Cultural ''\n|core \n|Disclosure depends on the norms for privacy and openness in a given culture.\n|The United States favors more openness in relational communication than does Japan\n|-\n|''Gender''\n|core \n|Privacy boundaries are sculpted differently by men and women based on socialization, which leads to difference in how rules are understood and operated in\n|American women are socialized to be more disclosive than men\n|-\n|''Context ''\n|catalyst\n|Shaped by issues of physical and social environments that factor in whether or not information will be shared\n|If we're in a traumatic situation (e.g., we've survived an earthquake together), we'll develop new rules\n|-\n|''Motivation ''\n|catalyst\n|Owners of information can form certain bonds that lead to disclosure, or conversely the express interest in forming bonds may cause private information to be shared. Motivations for sharing can include reciprocity or self-clarification.\n|If you have disclosed a great deal to me, out of reciprocity, I might be motivated to disclose to you\n|-\n|''Risk/benefit ratio ''\n|catalyst\n|Owners of private information evaluate risks relative to the benefits of disclosure or maintaining information private. \n|Our rules are influenced by our assessment of the ratio of risks to benefits of disclosing\n|}\nWith these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.\n\n===Boundary coordination===\nAn individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership.<ref name=\"Petronio 1991\" /> Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information.<ref name=\"Petronio 20072\"/> By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.  \n*'''''Boundary permeability''''' refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered ''thin''.<ref name=\"Petronio, Durham 20082\"/>\n*'''''Boundary linkage''''' has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.<ref name=\"Caughlin, Afifi 2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = Caughlin | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Afifi | first2 = T.D. | year = 2004 | title = When is topic avoidance unsatisfying?

When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared.<ref name=\"Petronio 1991\" /> A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined.\n\n===Boundary turbulence===\nOften, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners \u2013 this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. [[Clear-air turbulence|Turbulence]] among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had,<ref name=\"Petronio 20022\"/> which can happen for a number of reasons.\n\nBoundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.\n\nIn addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information.<ref name=\"Afifi 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = T. D. | year = 2003 | title = Feeling caught\" in stepfamilies: managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 729\u2013755 | doi=10.1177/0265407503206002}}</ref> An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.\n\nLastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of [[social media]] and, in particular, [[Facebook]], boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and [[Friending|\"friend\"]] their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kanter |first1=M. |last2=Robbins |first2=S. |title=The Impact of Parents \"Friending\" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent-Child Relationship Quality |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2012 |page=900 of 917 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x |volume=62|issue=5 }}</ref>\n\nIn cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners. In these cases, the goal of each party is to reduce turbulence by reestablishing and coordinating boundaries.<ref name=\"Petronio, et al. 19982\" /><ref name=\"Afifi 2003\" /> Turbulence doesn't always have a negative outcome, there has been studies which show that turbulence within relationships can lead to stronger and improved relationships.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McLaren|first1=R.M.|title=Emotions, Communicative responses, and relational consequences of boundary turbulence|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=August 2013|volume=30|issue=5|pages=606\u2013626|doi=10.1177/0265407512463997}}</ref>\n\n== Theory applications ==\nCommunication privacy management can be applied across different contexts, primarily include: (1) family communication, with a particular focus on parental privacy invasions, (2) online social media, (3) health, and (4) relational issues,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid = |volume=13 |pages=6\u201314|last1 = Petronio|first1 = Sandra}}</ref> and (5) work environments.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Seumas | last2 = Weckert | first2 = John | year = 2000 | title = Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 255\u201365 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006232417265 }}</ref>\n\n===Family communication===\n\nSpecific applications of CPM highlight family privacy management.

In the research, Twitter was regarded as an onion with multiple privacy layers. The research found out that there were significant differences at the descriptive and inferential levels among the multiple dimensions of private information, including daily lives, social identity, competence, socio-economic status, and health. Private information regarding daily lives and entertainment was disclosed easily and located at the outermost layer of the disclosure onion. In contrast, health-related private information was concealed and located within the innermost layer of the disclosure onion. What's more, there were significant differences among current Twitter users, nonusers, and dropouts with regard to personality traits and privacy concerns about Twitter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=95546c19-b61c-4971-9aaf-7eea06c2bcb6%40sessionmgr4008&hid=4114&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=90180338&db=ufh|title=The roles of virtual identity discrepancy and personality traits in communication privacy management on Twitter|last=Jin, Seung|first=A Annie|date=2013|website=|publisher=New Media & Society|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nYoung people especially highschool and college students are an important part of SNS users. A recent study examined college students' privacy concerns and impacts on their Twitter usage behaviors. Regression analyses concluded that Control and Boundary Rules of Private Information on Twitter significantly predict daily minutes spent on Twitter accounts. However, the same CPM variables did not predict college students' other Twitter usage behaviors (e.g., weekly inquiries and total months of using Twitter).

The study intended to addresses the issue of whether personal traits and predispositions can predict the tendencies to either reveal or conceal secrets shared in confidence by a best friend suggested that a combination of several traits could successfully distinguish those who revealed secrets from those who did not. Significant discriminators included tendency to gossip and depth of disclosure. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=cd2e4976-6af1-4f4e-984f-f0a0953a3789%40sessionmgr103&vid=0&hid=115&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=97239961&db=ufh|title=A Profile of Those Likely to Reveal Friends' Confidential Secrets|last=Bello, R.

Using CPM theory as a framework, a study surveyed a community sample of 273 adults to examine their retrospective accounts of privacy violations in personal relationships. Results showed that less than half of the sample offered explicit rules for information management, and the majority of participants blamed the confidant for the privacy turbulence. Findings indicated that people often do not share similar information with the violator in the future, but if they do, less than half offer explicit privacy rules during the privacy recalibration process. Confrontation efficacy was positively associated with initiating a conversation about the privacy turbulence and that people who engaged in privacy recalibration were more likely to report forgiveness and relational improvement and less likely to report relational damage than those individuals who did not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&sid=7f9fc8cf-95ac-4800-b9e5-28c8506b72a3%40sessionmgr107&hid=115&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=103187596&db=ufh|title=Privacy Recalibration in Personal Relationships: Rule Usage Before and After an Incident of Privacy Turbulence|last=Steuber, Keli Ryan|first=Rachel M.

The concept of [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]] has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Seumas|last2=Weckert|first2=John|title=Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=December 2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=255\u2013265|doi=10.1023/a:1006232417265}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|last2=Voas|first2=J.|last3=Hurlburt|first3=G.F.|title=BYOD: Security and Privacy Considerations|journal=IT Professional|date=Sep\u2013Oct 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=53\u201355|doi=10.1109/mitp.2012.93}}</ref>\nEven before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing.

For instance, a study that examined intercultural privacy management between foreign English teachers and Japanese co-workers uncovered cultural premises. This \"study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a \"free space\" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to intercultural privacy management and enhances CPM's cultural criteria.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nathaniel|date=2016-08-24|title=Cultural discourses of privacy: Interrogating globalized workplace relationships in Japan|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=0|pages=44\u201361|doi=10.1080/17513057.2016.1142601|issn=1751-3057}}</ref>  Within the same context, foreign English teachers \"employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing.

Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.\n\n[[Social penetration theory]] explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.\n\nFinally, [[coordinated management of meaning]] explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.\n\n==Academic integration==\nCommunication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Critique==\n\n=== Values ===\n\nAltman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different \"levels\" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure \"turbulence\", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.<ref name=\"Afifi 2003\" /><ref name=\"Petronio, Martin 1986\">{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Martin | first2 = J.N. | year = 1986 | title = Ramifications of revealing private information: A gender gap | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 499\u2013506 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198605)42:3<499::aid-jclp2270420317>3.0.co;2-i}}</ref><ref name=\"Petronio, Martin, Litlefield 1984\">{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S.

It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms ''balance'' and ''equilibrium'' in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. \"Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the ''degrees'' [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction\" (pp.&nbsp;12\u201313). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Privacy]]\n*[[Self-disclosure]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Communication theory|Privacy management theory]]\n[[Category:Interpersonal communication]]\n[[Category:Privacy]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 2 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_privacy_management_theory"}
