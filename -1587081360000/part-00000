A number of amateurs commenced broadcasting music in 1920 and 1921.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many other amateurs soon followed. 2CM was run by Charles MacLuran who started the station in 1921 with regular Sunday evening broadcasts from the Wentworth Hotel, Sydney. 2CM is often regarded as Australia's first, regular, non-official station.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bpadula.tripod.com/australiashortwave/id34.html|title=1923 - Evolution of Australian Domestic Radio|author=|date=|website=bpadula.tripod.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Sealed set system ====\nIt was not until November 1923 when the government finally gave its approval for a number of officially recognised [[medium wave]] stations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Australia, R.R. Walker 1973\"/>\nAll stations operated under a unique [[Sealed Set]] system under which each set was sealed to the frequency of one stationthe assets of all A Class stations.  It still exists as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Australian Broadcasting Co changed its name to the [[KIIS 106.5|Commonwealth Broadcasting Company]] and later the Australian Radio Network.  It soon purchased Sydney commercial station [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] and now has an Australia-wide network of commercial stations.\n\n====Types of programs ====\nAs with most countries, most Australian stations originally broadcast music interspersed with such things as talks, coverage of sporting events, church broadcasts, weather, news and time signals of various types. Virtually all stations also had programs of interest to women, and children's sessions. From the outset, A Class stations' peak-hour evening programs often consisted of live broadcasts from various [[theatres]], i.e. [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[musicals]], [[variety shows]], [[vaudeville]], etc. The first dramas especially written for radio were transmitted in the mid-1920s. By the 1930s, the ABC was transmitting a number of British programs sourced from the BBC, and commercial stations were receiving a number of US programs, particularly dramas. However, in the 1940s, war-time restrictions made it difficult to access overseas programs and, therefore, the amount of Australian dramatic material increased. As well as using original ideas and scripts, there were a number of local versions of overseas programs. Initially, muclevision broadcasts \u2013 these were conducted in the early hours of the morning, after the stations had officially closed down. In 1934 Dr Val McDowall<ref>https://www.racp.edu.au/page/library/college-roll/college-roll-detail&id=496 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504062337/https://www.racp.edu.au/page/library/college-roll/college-roll-detail%26id%3D496 |date=2015-05-04 }}</ref> at amateur station [[4CM]] Brisbane<ref>{{cite web|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212637/s00855804_1961_1962_6_4_750.pdf,|title=eSpace - The University of Queensland|author=|date=|website=espace.library.uq.edu.au|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> conducted experiments in electronic television.\n\n==== Mobile stations ====\nTwo of Australia's most unusual medium wave stations were mobile stations 2XT and 3YB. They both operated in eras prior to the universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of [[New South Wales]], from a [[New South Wales Government Railways|NSW Railways]] train, between November 1925 and December 192mber of such broadcasts at sea, on the way to Australia. 9MI's first official broadcast in April 1939 was made from the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The station broadcast on [[short wave]], usually a couple of times per week, but many of its programs were relayed to commercial medium wave stations that were also owned by AWA. The 9MI manager and announcer (and probably the only member of staff) was Eileen Foley.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.offshore-radio.de/HansKnot/female.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811095008/http://www.offshore-radio.de/HansKnot/female.htm |archive-date=2004-08-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 9MI ceased broadcasting at the commencement of World War II in September 1939. The Kanimbla was commissioned as a [[Royal Navy]] (later [[Royal Australian Navy]]) vessel with the name HMS/HMAS Kanimbla.

Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations while The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada offered its first commercially produced radio-broadcast receiver (Model \"C\") in 1921, followed by its \"Marconiphone\" Model I in 1923. Main themes in the history include the development of the engineering  technology; the construction of stations across the country and the building of networks; the widespread purchase and use of radio and television sets by the general public; debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations; financing of the broadcasts media through the government, license fees, and advertising; the changing content of the programming; the impact of the programming on Canadian identity; the media's influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics; the role of the Qu\u00e9bec government; Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes; the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations; fears of American cultural imperialism via the airwaves; and the impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media.<ref>Robert Armstrong, ''Broadcasting Policy in Canada'' (2013)</ref><ref>Marc Raboy, ''Missed Opportunities: The Story of Canada's Broadcasting Policy'' (1990)</ref>\n\nRadio signals carried long distances, and a number of American stations could easily be received in parts of Canada.  The first Canadian station was CFCF, originally an experimental station from the Marconi Company in Montreal.<ref>Mary Vipond, ''Listening In: The First Decade of Canadian Broadcasting 1922-1932'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1992)</ref> Civilian use of Wireless Telegraphy had been forbidden in Canada for the duration of World War I. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada was the only one to retain the right to continue radio experiments for military use.  This proved instrumental in giving the company a lead in developing an experimental radio broadcasting station immediately after the war. The first radio broadcast in Canada was accomplished by The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada in Montreal on December 1, 1919 under the call sign XWA (for \"Experimental Wireless Apparatus\") from its Williams Street factory. The station began regular programming on May 20, 1920 and its call letters were changed to CFCF on November 4, 1920.<ref>Murray R.P.\"The Early Development of Radio in Canada, 1901-1930: An Illustrated History\" (Robert P. Murray Editor, 2005)</ref> In Toronto, the first radio station was operated by the ''Toronto Star'' newspaper.  Station CKCE began in April 1922 and was so well received that the Star pushed forward with its own studios and transmitting facilities, returning to the air as CFCA in late June 1922.  In Montreal, another newspaper, ''La Presse'', put its own station, CKAC on the air in late September 1922.  Because there were governmental limitations on radio frequencies back then, CKAC and CFCF alternated\u2014one would broadcast one night, and the other would broadcast the night after that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=/listings_and_histories/radio/histories.php?id=495&historyID=246|title=Canadian Communications Foundation History of CKAC Radio|author=|date=|website=broadcasting-history.ca|accessdate=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422211234/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=%2Flistings_and_histories%2Fradio%2Fhistories.php%3Fid%3D495&historyID=246|archive-date=22 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> For a time, CKAC was broadcasting some programs in French, and some in English: in 1924, for example, the station rebroadcast fifteen Boston Bruins hockey games from station WBZ in Boston.  Meanwhile, in other Canadian provinces, 1922 was also the year for their first stations, including CJCE in Vancouver, and CQCA (which soon became CHCQ) in Calgary.\n\nAs radio grew in popularity during the mid-1920s, a problem arose:  the U.S. stations dominated the airwaves and with a limited number of frequencies available for broadcasters to use, it was the American stations that seemed to get most of them. This was despite an agreement with the US Department of Commerce (which supervised broadcasting in the years prior to the Federal Radio Commission) that a certain number of frequencies were reserved exclusively for Canadian signals. But if a US station wanted one of those frequencies, the Department of Commerce seemed unwilling to stop it, much to the frustration of Canadian owners who wanted to put stations on the air. The Canadian government and the US government began negotiations in late 1926, in hopes of finding a satisfactory solution.<ref>\"Canada Radio Fans Fight Interference.\" Tampa (FL) Tribune, January 16, 1927, p. 12D.</ref>  Meanwhile, in 1928, Canada got its first network, operated by the Canadian National Railways. CNR had already made itself known in radio since 1923, thanks in large part to the leadership of CNR's president, Sir Henry Thornton. The company began equipping its trains with radio receivers, and allowed passengers to hear radio stations from Canada and the US. In 1924, CN began building its own stations, and by 1928, it was able to create a network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_CNR.html|title=\"Canada's First Network.\"|author=|date=|website=broadcasting-history.ca|accessdate=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030330/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadcasting-history.ca%2Fnetworks%2Fnetworks_CNR.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1932, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was formed, and in 1936, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the country's national radio service, made its debut.\n\n=== Cuba ===\nThere was interest in radio almost from broadcasting's earliest days. Due to the proximity of Cuba to the U.S. state of Florida, some Cubans would try to listen to the American stations whose signals reached the island. But there was no radio station in Cuba until 1922.  The arrival of the first radio station, PWX, was greeted with enthusiasm.<ref>\"Cuban Mill Hands Like Radio Jazz.\" Boston Herald, April 1, 1923, p. 12D.</ref> PWX, owned by the Cuban Telephone Company, was located in Havana.  It was a joint venture with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company of New York.  PWX debuted on the air on October 10, 1922.<ref>\"Broadcasting at Havana, Cuba.\" Radio Magazine, February 1923 (volume 5, #2), p. 33.</ref>  PWX broadcast programs in both English and Spanish, and its signal was easily received at night in a number of American cities.<ref>\"The Voice from PWX.\" Winston-Salem (NC) Journal, September 21, 1924, p. 3.</ref> Another early station in Cuba was owned by Frank Jones, an American amateur radio operator and Chief Engineer of the Tuinucu Sugar Company.  The station used amateur call letters, and went on the air as 6KW.<ref>\"Cuban City Enjoys Free Radio Concert.\" Springfield Sunday Union and Republican, March 27, 1927, p. 11C.</ref> In late 1928, PWX began using the call letters CMC.  Its slogan was \"If you hear 'La Paloma,' you are in tune with CMC.\"<ref>\"A Bit o' This and That.\" Cleveland Plain Dealer, January 6, 1929, p. 2C.</ref>  As with many other countries, interest in radio expanded, and by 1932, Cuba had more than thirty stations, spread out in cities all over the island.<ref>\"Cuban and Mexican Broadcasters.\" Broadcasting Magazine, January 15, 1932, p. 6.</ref>\n\n=== France ===\n{{main|Radio France}}\n[[Radio Paris]] began operations in 1922, followed by Radio Toulouse and Radio Lyon.  Before 1940, 14 commercial and 12 public sector radio stations were in operation. The government exerted tight control over radio broadcasting. Political debate was not encouraged. In the 1932 election campaign, for example, the opposition was allowed one broadcast while the incumbent made numerous campaign broadcasts.<ref>Paul Starr, ''The Creation of the Media: Political Origins of Modern Communications'' (2004), p 376</ref> Radio was a potentially powerful new medium, but France was quite laggard in consumer ownership of radio sets, With 5 million radio receivers in 1937, compared to over 8 million and both Britain and Germany, and 26 million in the United States. The government imposed very strict controls on news dissemination. After 1938, stations were allowed only three brief daily bulletins, of seven minutes each, to cover all the day's news. The Prime Minister's office closely supervised the news items that were to be broadcast.  As war approached, Frenchmen learned little or nothing about it from the radio. The government thought that policy wise, because it wanted no interference in its policies. The unexpected result, however, was the Frenchman were puzzled and uncertain great crises erupted in 1938\u201339, and their morale and support for government policies was much weaker than in Britain.<ref>Anthony Adamthwaite, ''Grandeur and Misery: France's Bid for Power in Europe 1914-1940'' (1995) p 177-78.</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe first radio station in Germany went on the air in Berlin in late 1923, using the call letters \"LP.\"<ref name=\"Now Numbers Many Millions 1923, p. 13\"/>  Before 1933,  German radio broa\nThe first radio station in Japan was JOAK, which opened in Tokyo in March 1925.  It was founded by Masajiro Kotamura, an inventor and engineer. It was unique in that at least one of its announcers was a woman, Akiko Midorikawa.<ref>\"Station JOAK of Japan.\" Boston Herald, April 11, 1926, p. 6.</ref> JOAK was followed soon after by JOBK in Osaka and JOCK in Nagoya.  The National Broadcasting Service, today known as NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai), began in August 1926. All stations were supported by licensing fees:  in 1926, for example, people wishing to receive a permit to own a radio set paid a fee of one yen a month to the government.<ref>\"Japan Hides Radio Artists.\" Seattle Daily Times, September 7, 1927, p. K4.</ref> Programming on Japanese stations of the 1920s included music, news, language instruction (lessons were offered in English, French and German) and educations talks.  These early stations broadcast on average about eight hours of programs a day.<ref>Carl H. Butman, \"Nippon Keeps Tight Grip on Radio.\"  Springfield Republican, September 11, 1927, p. 6C.</ref>\n\n=== Mexico ===\nAmateur radio was very popular in Mexico; while most of the hams were male, notably Constantino de Tarnava, acknowledged in some sources as Mexico's first amateur radio operator,<ref>Marvin Alinsky, ''International Handbook of Broadcasting Systems'', Greenwood Press, 1988, p. 215</ref> one of the early ham radio operators was female\u2014Maria Dolores Estrada.<ref>\"Mexican Girl Gets First Grade Commercial License.\" QST, January 1917, p. 49.</ref> But commercial radio was difficult to achieve, due to a federal regulation forbidding any broadcasts that were not for the benefit of the Mexican government. Still, in November 1923, CYL in Mexico City went on the air, featuring music (both folk songs and popular dance concerts), religious services, and news. CYL used as its slogans \"El Universal\" and \"La Casa del Radio\", and it won over the government, by giving political candidates the opportunity to use the station to campaign.<ref>Susan Haymes. \"A Junket to the Mexico City Studios of CYL.\" Radio Digest, November 14, 1925, pp. 7,12.</ref> Its signal was so powerful that it was even received in Canada sometimes.<ref>\"Novel Programs from CYL Mexico.\" Toronto Globe, December 9, 1925, p. 9.</ref> Pressure from listeners and potential station owners also contributed to the government relenting and allowing more stations to go on the air.<ref>Marvin Alinsky, ''International Handbook of Broadcasting Systems'', Greenwood Press, 1988, p. 216.</ref> In 1931, the \"C\" call letters were all changed to \"X\" call letters (XE being reserved for broadcasting), and by 1932, Mexico had nearly forty radio stations, ten of which were in Mexico City.<ref>\"Cuban and Mexican Broadcasters.\" Broadcasting magazine, January 15, 1932, p. 6.</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nOn 6 November 1919, the Dutch radio pioneer [[Hanso Idzerda|Hans Henricus Schotanus \u00e0 Steringa Idzerda]] started regular radio transmissions from [[The Hague]]. As these were regular transmissions and the program was announced beforehand in the newspaper [[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant|NRC]], this is seen as the start of commercial broadcasting.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nInterest in amateur radio was noted in the Philippines in the early 1920s.<ref>\"Signals Heard by Island.\" Portland Oregonian, March 15, 1925, p. 9</ref>  There were radio stations operating in the Philippines, including one owned by American businessman named Henry Hermann, as early as 1922, according to some sources; not much documentation about that period of time exists.  In the autumn of 1927, KZRM in Manila, owned by the Radio Corporation of the Philippines, went on the air.<ref>\"Manila Goes on the Air to Entertain the Orient.\" New York Times, October 2, 1927, p. XX18.</ref> The Radio Corporation of the Philippines was a subsidiary of American company RCA (Radio Corporation of America).<ref>\"To Open Manila Studio.\"  New York Times, February 13, 1927, p. E18.</ref> By 1932, the island had three radio stations: KRZC in Cebu, as well as KZIB (owned by a department store) and KZFM, the government-owned station in Manila. Of the stations listed by Pierre Key, KZFM was the strongest, with 50,000 watts.<ref>Pierre Key's Radio Annual, 1933 edition, pp. 269-270.</ref>  Two radio networks were ultimately created:  one, the Manila Broadcasting Company, began as a single station, KZRH in Manila, in July 1939, and after World War II, in 1946, the station's owners began to develop their network by buying other radio properties. As for the Philippine Broadcasting Company, it too began with one station (KZFM), and received its new name in mid-1946, after the Philippines became an independent country. At the end of 1946, the new network had six stations.<ref>\"KZPI Power Will Go to 10 KW on January 1.\"  Broadcasting Magazine, December 16, 1946, p. 30.</ref>  Both KZRH and KZFM also affiliated with American networks; the stations wanted to have access to certain popular American programs, and the American networks wanted to sell products in the Philippines.<ref>\"Advertisement for KZRH: The Voice of the Philippines.\" Broadcasting Magazine, December 16, 1946, p. 55.</ref>\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\n[[Sri Lanka]] has the oldest radio station in Asia (world's second oldest). The station was known as [[Radio Ceylon]]. It developed into one of the finest broadcasting institutions in the world. It is now known as the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]]. Sri Lanka created [[broadcasting]] history in Asia when broadcasting was started in Ceylon by the Telegraph Department in 1923 on an experimental footing, just three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe. Gramophone music was broadcast from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office with the aid of a small transmitter built by the Telegraph Department engineers from the radio equipment of a captured German submarine.<ref name=\"Transmitter\">{{cite web|title=For that Old Magic (Frontline Magazine, India)|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918024249/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm|archivedate=2008-09-18}}</ref> This broadcasting experiment was successful; barely three years later, on December 16, 1925, a regular broadcasting service came to be instituted. Edward Harper who came to [[Ceylon]] as Chief Engineer of the Telegraph Office in 1921, was the first person to actively promote broadcasting in Ceylon. [[Sri Lanka]] occupies an important place in the history of broadcasting with broadcasting services inaugurated just three years after the launch of the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. [[Edward Harper (engineer)|Edward Harper]] launched the first experimental broadcast as well as founding the Ceylon Wireless Club, together with British and Ceylonese radio enthusiasts on the island. Edward Harper has been dubbed ' the Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon,' because of his pioneering efforts, his skill and his determination to succeed. Edward Harper and his fellow Ceylonese radio enthusiasts, made it happen.\n\n=== United Kingdom===\n[[File:INF3-49 Sir John Reith Artist Wooding.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature of Sir John Reith, by the artist, Wooding.]]\nThe first experimental music broadcasts, from [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi's]] factory in [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]], began in 1920. Two years later, in October 1922, a consortium of radio manufacturers formed the [[British Broadcasting Company]] (BBC); they allowed some sponsored programs, although they were not what we would today consider a fully commercial station.  Meanwhile, the first radio stations in England were experimental station [[2MT]], located near Chelmsford, and station [[2LO]] in London:  both were operated by the Marconi Company.  By late 1923, there were six stations broadcasting regularly in the United Kingdom: London's 2LO, [[Manchester|Manchester's]] [[2ZY]], and stations in [[Birmingham]] ([[5IT]]), [[Cardiff]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], and [[Glasgow]].<ref name=\"Now Numbers Many Millions 1923, p. 13\">\"Radio Audience Now Numbers Many Millions.\" Springfield Republican, September 30, 1923, p. 13.</ref>  As for the consortium of radio manufacturers, it dissolved in 1926, when its license expired; it then became the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], a non-commercial organization. Its governors are appointed by the British government, but they do not answer to it. Lord [[John Charles Walsham Reith|Reith]] took a formative role in developing the BBC, especially in radio.<ref name=\"Lord Reith\">{{cite news |title=News article on Lord Reith in The Guardian Newspaper, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/07/mediatop100200361|accessdate=2008-10-13 | date=2003-07-07}}</ref>  Working as its first manager and Director-General, he promoted the philosophy of ''[[public service broadcasting]]'', firmly grounded in the moral benefits of [[education]] and of uplifting [[entertainment]], eschewing [[commerce|commercial]] influence and maintaining a maximum of independence from political control.\n\nCommercial stations such as [[Radio Normandie]] and [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] broadcast into the UK from other European countries. This provided a very popular alternative to the rather austere BBC. These stations were closed during the War, and only Radio Luxembourg returned afterward. BBC television broadcasts in Britain began on November 2, 1936, and continued until [[World War II|wartime]] conditions closed the [[Service (economics)|service]] in 1939.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{main|Radio in the United States}}\n[[File:Fessenden.JPG|thumb|Reginald Fessenden, the ''father'' of radio broadcasting in the US.]]\n[[Reginald Fessenden]] did ground-breaking experiments with voice and music by 1906.<ref>Mike Adams, ''Lee de Forest, King of Radio, Television and Film''.

A few early stations, notably 8MK (later known as WWJ in Detroit) were started by newspapers, but in those early years, radio and newspapers regarded each other as competitors. One early station, 8XK in Pittsburgh, became [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in 1920; its ownership has asserted that it was the first radio station in the US, but that claim is controversial <ref>Donna Halper. \"When Broadcasting Really Began.\" The Broadcasters' Desktop Resource. November 2016. [https://www.thebdr.net/articles/prof/history/DiggingTruth.pdf]</ref> There were other stations on the air around the same time as KDKA, including a station at Union College in Schenectady, New York that became known as WRUC; 8MK in Detroit; 1XE in Medford Hillside MA, and several others. KDKA received a commercial license and began broadcasting on November 2, 1920.\n\nMadison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. The United States never had a licensing fee for set users.<ref>Susan Smulyan, ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)</ref> The [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] began regular broadcasting in 1926, with telephone links between New York and other Eastern cities.  NBC became the dominant radio network, splitting into Red and Blue networks.  The [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] began in 1927 under the guidance of [[William S. Paley]].\n\nRadio in education began as early as April 1922, when Medford Hillside's WGI Radio broadcast the first of an ongoing series of educational lectures from Tufts College professors.  These lectures were described by the press as a sort of \"wireless college.\"<ref>\"Tufts College to Give Radio Lecture Course.\" Olympia (WA) Daily Recorder, March 25, 1922, p. 5.</ref>  Soon, other colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula; some, like the University of Iowa, even provided what today would be known as distance-learning credits.<ref>\"U of I Offers Full Credits in Air School.\" Rockford (IL) Daily Register, October 5, 1925, p.  4.</ref> [[Curry College]], first in Boston and then in Milton, Massachusetts, introduced one of the nation's first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs.  This success led to numerous radio courses in the curriculum which has taught thousands of radio broadcasters from the 1930s to today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curry.edu|title=Curry College - Home|author=|date=|website=www.curry.edu|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, several independent stations formed the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] to exchange syndicated programming, including ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''. Prior to 1927, U.S. radio was supervised by the Department of Commerce.  Then, the Radio Act of 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission (FRC);<ref>\"The Radio Act.\" Central Law Journal, March 4, 1927, p. 158.</ref> in 1934, this agency became known as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A [[Federal Communications Commission]] decision in 1939 required [[NBC]] to divest itself of its [[Blue Network]].  That decision was sustained by the Supreme Court in a 1943 decision, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, which established the framework that the \"scarcity\" of radio-frequency meant that broadcasting was subject to greater regulation than other media. This [[Blue Network]] network became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). Around 1946, ABC, NBC, and CBS began regular television broadcasts. Another TV network, the [[DuMont Television Network]], was founded earlier, but was disbanded in 1956; later in 1986 the surviving DuMont independent stations formed the nucleus of the new [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref name=\"DTNHWS\">[http://www.dumonthistory.tv/9.html DuMont Television Network Historical Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027143941/http://dumonthistory.tv/9.html |date=2010-10-27 }}.

He is remembered for founding [[Carols by Candlelight]], as a pioneer football commentator, and for hosting both musical and interview programs. In later years he was one of Melbourne's first and most prominent [[talk radio|talk back]] hosts. At the commencement of his career, Banks was known for his double entendres and risque remarks; as a talk back host he was outspoken in his conservative views, especially regarding the [[White Australia policy]] and [[Apartheid]]. In 1978 his 47-year career in radio was hailed as the longest in world history.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Langmore|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1981-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnG_tEGjSloC&pg=PA57|year=2007|publisher=The Miegunyah Press|pages=56\u201357|isbn=9780522853827}}</ref> Not including the early television experiments (see above), mainstream television transmission commenced in Sydney and Melbourne in the latter part of 1956, that is, in time for the 1956 [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne]] [[Olympic Games]] in November/December 1956. It was then phased in to other capital cities, and then into rural markets. Many forms entertainment, particularly drama and variety, were considered more suited to television than radio, and many such programs were gradually deleted from radio schedules. \n[[File:Norman Banks Naomi Melwit 3KZ.jpg|thumb|right|Naomi (\"Joan\") Melwit and [[Norman Banks (broadcaster)|Norman Banks]] at the 3KZ microphone, in the late 1930s.]]\n\nThe [[transistor radio]] first appeared on the market in 1954. In particular, it made portable radios even more transportable. All sets quicklly became smaller, cheaper and more convenient. The aim of radio manufacturers became a radio in every room, in the car, and in the pocket. The upshot of these two changes was that stations started to specialise and concentrate on specific markets. The first areas to see specialised stations were the news and current affairs market, and stations specialising in [[pop music]] and geared toward the younger listener who was now able to afford his/her own radio. [[talk radio|Talk back]] (\"talk radio\") became a major radio genre by the end of the 1960s, but it was not legalised in Australia until October 1967.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Changing Stations \u2013 The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', Bridget Griffen-Foley, Sydney, 2009</ref> The fears of intrusion were addressed by a beep that occurred every few seconds, so that the caller knew that his/her call was being broadcast. There was also a seven-second delay so that obscene or libelous material could be monitored. By the end of the 1960s, specialisation by radio stations had increased dramatically and there were stations focusing on various kinds of music, talk back, news, sport, etc.\n\n=== Germany ===\nWhen the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was organized in 1949, its Enabling Act established strong state government powers.  Broadcasting was organized on a state, rather than a national, basis.  Nine regional radio networks were established.  A technical coordinating organization, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der \u00f6ffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (ARD), came into being in 1950 to lessen technical conflicts. The Allied forces in Europe developed their own radio networks, including the U.S. [[American Forces Network]] (AFN).  Inside Berlin, [[Radio in the American Sector]] (RIAS) became a key source of news in the German Democratic Republic.<ref name=\"Radio In The American Sector\">{{cite web |title=RIAS Berlin \u2013 Radio in the American sector Berlin |url=http://kosoe.blogspot.com/2006/09/rias-berlin-radio-in-american-sector.html|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref> Germany began developing a network of VHF FM broadcast stations in 1955 because of the excessive crowding of the mediumwave and shortwave broadcast bands.1933\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\n[[Radio Ceylon]] ruled the airwaves in the 1950s and 1960s in the Indian sub-continent.<ref name=\"Radio Ceylon\">{{cite web|title=When Ceylon ruled the airwaves |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2006/01/01/stories/2006010100150400.htm |accessdate=2008-09-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219081446/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2006/01/01/stories/2006010100150400.htm |archivedate=2008-12-19 }}</ref> The station developed into the most popular radio network in South Asia.

This was Radio Ceylon's golden era.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nRadio Luxembourg remained popular during the 1950s but saw its audience decline as commercial television and [[pirate radio]], combined with a switch to a less clear frequency, began to erode its influence. BBC television resumed on June 7, 1946, and commercial television began on September 22, 1955. Both used the pre-war [[405-line]] standard. BBC2 came on the air on April 20, 1964, using the 625-line standard, and began [[PAL]] colour transmissions on July 1, 1967,  the first in Europe. The two older networks transmitted in 625-line colour from 1969. During the 1960s there was still no UK-based commercial radio. A number of 'pirate' radio ships, located in international waters just outside the jurisdiction of English law, came on the air between 1964 and 1967. The most famous of these was [[Radio Caroline]], which was the only station to continue broadcasting after the offshore pirates were effectively outlawed on August 14, 1967 by the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]]. It was finally forced off air due to a dispute over tendering payments, but returned in 1972 and continued on and off until 1990. (The station subsequently broadcast legally, initially under 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence]]s and subsequently via satellite (since closed), internet streams, and (since 2017) a local AM transmitter.)\n\n=== United States ===\n[[Television]] began to replace radio as the chief source of revenue for broadcasting networks.  Although many radio programs continued through this decade, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[The Guiding Light]]'', by 1960 networks had ceased producing entertainment programs. As radio stopped producing formal fifteen-minute to hourly programs, a new format developed.  \"[[Top 40]]\" was based on a continuous rotation of short pop songs presented by a \"disc jockey.\"  Famous [[disc jockey]]s in the era included [[Alan Freed]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Don Imus]] and [[Wolfman Jack]].  Top 40 playlists were theoretically based on record sales; however, record companies began to [[bribe]] [[disc jockey]]s to play selected artists, in a controversy that was called \"[[payola]]\". In the 1950s, American television networks introduced broadcasts in color. The Federal Communications Commission approved the world's first monochrome-compatible color television standard in December 1953. The first network colorcast followed on January 1, 1954, with NBC transmitting the annual Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California to over 20 stations across the country. An educational television network, National Educational Television (NET), predecessor to [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], was founded. Shortwave broadcasting played an important part of fighting the cold war with Voice of America and the [[BBC]] World Service, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty transmitting through the \"[[Iron Curtain]]\", and Radio Moscow and others broadcasting back, as well as \"jamming\" (transmitting to cause intentional interference) the Western stations in the [[Soviet bloc]].\n\n== 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{main|History of broadcasting in Australia}}\n\n[[File:Australian Broadcasting Corporation logo (1974-).svg|thumb|The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] logo, first introduced in 1975 and based on the [[Lissajous curve]].]]\nAfter much procrastination on the part of various federal governments, [[FM broadcasting]] was eventually introduced in 1975. (There had been official experiments with FM broadcasting as far back as [[Timeline of Australian radio|1948]].) Only a handful of radio stations were given new licences during the 1940s, 50s & 60s but, since 1975, many hundreds of new broadcasting licences have been issued on both the FM and AM bands.  In the latter case, this was made possible by having 9&nbsp;kHz between stations, rather 10&nbsp;kHz breaks, as per the [[Geneva Frequency Plan]]. The installation of directional aerials also encouraged more AM stations. The type of station given FM licences reflects the policies and philosophies of the various Australian governments. Initially, only the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[community radio]] stations were granted FM licences.  However, after a change of government, commercial stations were permitted on the band, as from 1980. At first, one or two brand new stations were permitted in each major market. However, in 1990, one or two existing AM stations in each major market were given FM licences; the stations being chosen by an auction system. Apart from an initial settling-in period for those few stations transferred from AM to FM, there has been no simulcasting between AM and FM stations.\nIn major cities, a number of brand new FM licences were issued in the 1990s and 2000s. All rural regions which traditionally had only one commercial station now have at least one AM and one FM commercial station.  In many cases, the owner of the original station now has at least two outlets. The number of regional transmitters for the ABC's five networks also increased dramatically during this era.\n\n=== Europe ===\nCommercial radio (re-)legalisation in most European countries occurred in this era, starting with United Kingdom in 1973 (see [[Independent Local Radio]]) and ending with Austria in 1995.<br />\nIn 1987, stations in the [[European Broadcasting Union]] began offering [[Radio Data System|Radio Data System (RDS)]], which provides written text information about programs that were being broadcast,  as well as traffic alerts, accurate time, and other teletext services.<ref name=\"Radio Data System\">{{cite web |title=Radio Data System in the UK|url=http://www.radioandtelly.co.uk/rds.html|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nThe Government of Sri Lanka opened up the market in the late 1970s and 1980s allowing private companies to set up radio and television stations. Sri Lanka's public services broadcasters are the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC), Independent Television Net Work (ITN) and the affiliated radio station called Lak-handa. They had stiff competition on their hands with the private sector. Broadcasting in Sri Lanka went through a transformation resulting in private broadcasting institutions being set up on the island among them Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd (TNL), Maharaja Television \u2013 TV, Sirasa TV and Shakthi TV, and EAP Network (Pvt) Ltd \u2013 known as Swarnawahini \u2013 these private channels all have radio stations as well. The 1990s saw a new generation of radio stations being established in Sri Lanka among them the 'Hiru' radio station. In the 1980s public service broadcasters like the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] set up their own FM arm. Sri Lanka celebrated 80 years of broadcasting in December 2005. In January 2007 the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation celebrated 40 years as a public corporation.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nA new pirate station, Swiss-owned Radio Nordsee International, broadcast to Britain and the Netherlands from 1970 until outlawed by Dutch legislation in 1974 (which meant it could no longer be supplied from the European mainland). The English service was heavily jammed by both Labour and Conservative Governments in 1970 amid suggestions that the ship was actually being used for espionage. Radio Caroline returned in 1972 and continued until its ship sank in 1980 (the crew were rescued). A Belgian station, Radio Atlantis, operated an English service for a few months before the Dutch act came into force in 1974. Land-based commercial radio finally came on air in 1973 with London's [[LBC]] and [[Capital Radio]]. [[Channel 4]] television started in November 1982. Britain's UHF system was originally designed to carry only four networks. Pirate radio enjoyed another brief resurgence with a literal re-launch of Radio Caroline in 1983, and the arrival of American-owned [[Laser 558]] in 1985. Both stations were harassed by the British authorities; Laser closed in 1987 and Caroline in 1989, since then it has pursued legal methods of broadcasting, such as temporary FM licences and satellite. Two rival satellite television systems came on the air at the end of the 1980s: [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]] and [[British Satellite Broadcasting]]. Huge losses forced a rapid merger, although in many respects it was a takeover of BSB (Britain's official, Government-sanctioned satellite company) by Sky. Radio Luxembourg launched a 24-hour English channel on satellite, but closed its AM service in 1989 and its satellite service in 1991.\n\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] in UK law marked the establishment of two licensing authorities \u2013 the [[Radio Authority]] and the [[Independent Television Commission]] \u2013 to facilitate the licensing of non-[[BBC]] broadcast services, especially [[Restricted Service Licence|short-term broadcasts]]. [[Five (TV)|Channel 5]] went on the air on March 30, 1997, using \"spare\" frequencies between the existing channels.\n\n=== United States ===\nThe rise of [[frequency modulation|FM]] changed the listening habits of younger Americans.  Many stations such as WNEW-FM in New York City began to play whole sides of record albums, as opposed to the \"Top 40\" model of two decades earlier. In the 1980s, the [[Federal Communications Commission]], under Reagan Administration and Congressional pressure, changed the rules limiting the number of radio and television stations a business entity could own in one metropolitan area.  This [[deregulation]] led to several groups, such as [[Infinity Broadcasting]] and [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] to buy many stations in major cities.  The cost of these stations' purchases led to a conservative approach to broadcasting, including limited playlists and avoiding controversial subjects to not offend listeners, and increased commercials to increase revenue. AM radio declined throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to various reasons including: Lower cost of FM receivers, narrow AM audio bandwidth, and poor sound in the AM section of automobile receivers (to combat the crowding of stations in the AM band and a \"[[loudness war]]\" conducted by AM broadcasters), and increased radio noise in homes caused by fluorescent lighting and introduction of electronic devices in homes.  AM radio's decline flattened out in the mid-1990s due to the introduction of niche formats and over commercialization of many FM stations.\n\n== The 2000s ==\n[[File:A Kerbango.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The \"[[Kerbango]] Internet Radio\" was the first stand-alone product that let users listen to Internet radio without a computer.]]\nThe 2000s saw the introduction of [[digital radio]] and direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS) in the USA. Digital radio services, except in the United States, were allocated a new frequency band in the range of 1.4&nbsp;GHz. Regular shortwave broadcasts using Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), a digital broadcasting scheme for short and medium wave broadcasts have begun.  This system makes the normally scratchy international broadcasts clear and nearly FM quality, and much lower transmitter power.  This is much better to listen to and has more languages.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, from August 2009, digital radio was phased in by geographical region. Today, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], commercial and [[community radio]] stations operate on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and FM bands.  Most [[List of radio stations in Australia|stations]] are available on the [[internet]] and most also have [[digital radio|digital]] outlets. By 2007, there were 261 commercial stations in Australia.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The ABC currently has five AM/FM networks and is in the process of establishing a series of supplementary music stations that are only available on digital radios and [[digital television]] sets. SBS provides non-English language programs over its two networks, as do a number of community radio stations.\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] plans to move all Canadian broadcasting to the digital band and close all mediumwave and FM stations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== Europe ===\nEuropean stations have begun digital broadcasting ([[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]).  Digital radios began to be sold in the United Kingdom in 1998.\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] in 2005 when Sri Lanka celebrated 80 years in Broadcasting, the former Director-General of the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]], Eric Fernando called for the station to take full advantage of the digital age \u2013 this included looking at the archives of [[Radio Ceylon]]. Ivan Corea asked the President of Sri Lanka, [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] to invest in the future of the SLBC.<ref name=\"Eighty Years\">{{cite web|title=Eighty Years in Broadcasting in Sri Lanka (Daily News, Colombo) |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/27/fea02.htm |accessdate=2008-09-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925204950/http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/27/fea02.htm |archivedate=2008-09-25 }}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, this band was deemed to be vital to national defense, so an alternate band in the range of 2.3&nbsp;GHz was introduced for satellite broadcasting.  Two American companies, [[XM Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]], introduced DBS systems, which are funded by direct subscription, as in [[cable television]].  The XM and Sirius systems provide approximately 100 channels each, in exchange for monthly payments. In addition, a consortium of companies received FCC approval for In-Band On-Channel digital broadcasts in the United States, which use the existing mediumwave and FM bands for transmission.  However, early IBOC tests showed interference problems with adjacent channels, which has slowed adoption of the system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[AM broadcasting#History]]\n* [[FM broadcasting#History]]\n* [[Oldest radio station]]\n* [[Oldest television station]]\n* [[Birth of public radio broadcasting]]\n* [[Women in early radio]]\n* [[History of advertising]]\n* [[History of radio]]\n* [[Timeline of radio]]\n* [[Timeline of the introduction of radio in countries]]\n* [[Radio broadcasting]]\n* [[History of telecommunication]]\n* [[History of television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Briggs Asa.

This followed on from pioneering work in the field by a number of people including [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]], [[Georg Ohm]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref>Mimi Colligan, ''Golden Days of Radio'', Australia Post, 1991</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2019}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Australian Radio History'', Bruce Carty, Sydney, 2011</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2019}}<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{cite book|title=When Radio was the Cat's Whiskers|first1=Bernard|last1=Harte|date=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6LGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=radio+2XT+mobile&source=bl#v=onepage&q=radio%202XT%20mobile&f=false|page=138\n|publisher=Rosenberg Publishing, 2002|isbn=9781921719707}}</ref>\n\nThe [[radio broadcasting]] of music and talk intended to reach a dispersed audience started experimentally around 1905\u20131906, and commercially around 1920 to 1923. [[VHF]] (very high frequency) stations started 30 to 35 years later.\nIn the early days, radio stations broadcast on the [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]] and [[shortwave]] bands, and later on VHF ([[very high frequency]]) and UHF ([[ultra high frequency]]). However, in the United Kingdom, Hungary, France and some other places, from as early as 1890 there was already a system whereby news, music, live theatre, [[music hall]], fiction readings, religious broadcasts, etc., were available in private homes [and other places] via the conventional [[history of the telephone|telephone]] line, with subscribers being supplied with a number of special, personalised [[headset (audio)|headsets]]. In Britain this system was known as [[Electrophone (information system)|Electrophone]], and was available as early as 1895 or 1899 [sources vary] and up until 1926.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> In Hungary, it was called [[Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3]] [1893-1920s], and in France, [[Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone]] [1890-1932]). The Wikipedia [[Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3]] page includes a 1907 program guide which looks remarkably similar to the types of schedules used by many broadcasting stations some 20 or 30 years later.\n\nBy the 1950s, virtually every country had a broadcasting system, typically one owned and operated by the government. Alternative modes included commercial radio, as in the United States; or a dual system with both state sponsored and commercial stations, introduced in Australia as early as 1924, with Canada following in 1932. Today, most countries have evolved into a dual system,  including the UK. By 1955, practically every family in North America and Western Europe, as well as Japan, had a radio. A dramatic change came in the 1960s with the introduction of small inexpensive portable transistor radios which greatly expanded ownership and usage.  Access became practically universal around the world.\n\n== Early broadcasting ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n{{main|Radio in Argentina}}\nArgentina was a world pioneer in broadcasting, being the third country in the world to make its first regular broadcasts in 1920, having been the first Spanish-speaking country in Latin America to offer daily radio broadcasts. The main stations were in Buenos Aires and C\u00f3rdoba. Among the historical facts related to Argentine radio, it can be mentioned that the first radio broadcast was made with the live broadcast of Richard Wagner's opera [[Parsifal]] from the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires, on August 27, 1920, in charge of the Radio Argentina Society of [[Enrique Tel\u00e9maco Susini|Enrique Susini]], C\u00e9sar Guerrico, Miguel Mugica, Luis Romero and Ignacio G\u00f3mez, who installed a transmitting device on the roof of the building, for which they are remembered as \"The crazy people on the roof\".\n\nIn 1921, the transmission of classical music became a daily occurrence. The following year, the assumption of President [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]] was broadcast live. In September 1923 the famous \"fight of the century\" was issued between Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo and Jack Dempsey from the Polo Grounds in New York, and in October of the following year the match between the Argentine and Uruguayan national teams was broadcast. Also at that time the first advertisements, called \"reclames\", were put on the air. At the end of the decade the radio drama was born.\nIn those years several radio stations arose, Argentina (originally Radio Argentina), Culture, Excelsior, Mitre (originally South American), Splendid (originally Grand Splendid), Belgrano (originally National), Prieto (originally Broadcasting Critic), Del Pueblo - (originally Quilmes Broadcasting ), America-, Antartida (originally F\u00e9nix), Municipal, Rivadavia (originally Muebles D\u00edaz), Porte\u00f1a and Stentor (originally Sarmiento).\n\nThe introduction of the loudspeakers substantially modified the listening conditions. The receiving apparatus was gaining an important place in the home, gathering around the family. Meanwhile, the multiplication of the stations generated the first conflicts over the airwaves, which led to the first regulations on emission frequencies at the end of the 20s.\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{main|History of broadcasting in Australia}}\nThe [[History of broadcasting in Australia]] has been shaped for over a century by the problem of communication across long distances, coupled with a strong base in a wealthy society with a deep taste for aural communications.  Australia developed its own system, through its own engineers, manufacturers, retailers, newspapers, entertainment services, and news agencies. The government set up the first radio system, and business interests marginalized the hobbyists and amateurs.   The Labor Party was especially interested in radio because it allowed them to bypass the newspapers, which were mostly controlled by the opposition. Both parties agreed on the need for a national system, and in 1932 set up the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as a government agency that was largely separate from political interference. The first commercial broadcasters, originally known as \"B\" class stations, were on the air as early as 1925. The number of stations (commercial and national) remained relatively dormant throughout World War II and in the post-war era.\n\n==== Formative years ====\nAustralian [[Amateur radio operator|radio hams]] can be traced to the early 1900s. The 1905 ''Wireless Telegraphy Act''<ref>http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C07914</ref> whilst acknowledging the existence of wireless telegraphy, brought all broadcasting matters in Australia under the control of the Federal Government.<ref name=\"Australia, R.R. Walker 1973\">''The Magic Spark \u2013 50 Years of Radio in Australia'', R.R. Walker, Melbourne, 1973.</ref> In 1906, the first official [[Morse code]] transmission in Australia was by the [[Marconi Company]] between [[Queenscliff, Victoria]] and [[Devonport, Tasmania]].\n\n==== Experiments with broadcasting music ====\nThe first broadcast of music was made during a demonstration on 13 August 1919 by [[Ernest Fisk]] (later Sir Ernest) of AWA \u2013 [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]].  A number of amateurs commenced broadcasting music in 1920 and 1921.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many other amateurs soon followed. 2CM was run by Charles MacLuran who started the station in 1921 with regular Sunday evening broadcasts from the Wentworth Hotel, Sydney. 2CM is often regarded as Australia's first, regular, non-official station.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bpadula.tripod.com/australiashortwave/id34.html|title=1923 - Evolution of Australian Domestic Radio|author=|date=|website=bpadula.tripod.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Sealed set system ====\nIt was not until November 1923 when the government finally gave its approval for a number of officially recognised [[medium wave]] stations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Australia, R.R. Walker 1973\"/>\nAll stations operated under a unique [[Sealed Set]] system under which each set was sealed to the frequency of one station. Part of the price of the set went to the government via the [[Postmaster-General's Department]] (PMG), with money also going to the broadcaster.  Apart from extremely limited advertising, this was the broadcasters' only source of income.  From the outset problems with the system came to the fore. Many young people built their own sets, which could receive all the stations.<ref name=\"Australia, R.R. Walker 1973\"/> The sealed set system was devised by broadcasting pioneer [[Ernest Fisk]] of AWA \u2013 [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]].\n\n==== Categories in Australia from 1924 ====\nAs quickly as July 1924, the Sealed Set system was declared to be unsuccessful and it was replaced by a system of A Class and B Class stations.  There were one or two A Class stations in each major market and these were paid for by a listener's licence fee imposed on all listeners-in. The five former sealed set stations became A Class stations, and they were soon joined by stations in other State capitals.<ref name=\"Australia, R.R. Walker 1973\"/>\n[[File:Emil Voigt.jpg|thumb|right|Emil Voigt, founder of 2KY on behalf of the [[Labor Council of New South Wales]]. This photo was taken in earlier days when Voight was a prominent British athlete, and winner of the [[Olympic medal|Gold Medal]] for the five mile race at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London.]]\nFrom 1929, all A Class stations received all their programs from the one source, the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] which was made up of the following shareholders: [[Event Cinemas|Greater Union Theatres]] (a [[movie theater|movie theatre]] chain), [[Ben Fuller (producer)|Fuller's Theatres]] (a [[theatre|live theatre]] chain) and [[Albert Music|J. Albert & Sons]] (music publishers and retailers). A number of B Class stations were also licensed.  These did not receive any government monies and were expected to derive their income from advertising, sponsorship, or other sources.  Within a few years B Class stations were being referred to as \"commercial stations\".\n\nAmateur broadcasters continued to operate in the [[long wave]] and [[short wave]] bands.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA national service, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]], was formed in July 1932, when the Australian Broadcasting Company's contract expired.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The Corporation took over the assets of all A Class stations.  It still exists as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Australian Broadcasting Co changed its name to the [[KIIS 106.5|Commonwealth Broadcasting Company]] and later the Australian Radio Network.  It soon purchased Sydney commercial station [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] and now has an Australia-wide network of commercial stations.\n\n====Types of programs ====\nAs with most countries, most Australian stations originally broadcast music interspersed with such things as talks, coverage of sporting events, church broadcasts, weather, news and time signals of various types. Virtually all stations also had programs of interest to women, and children's sessions. From the outset, A Class stations' peak-hour evening programs often consisted of live broadcasts from various [[theatres]], i.e. [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[musicals]], [[variety shows]], [[vaudeville]], etc. The first dramas especially written for radio were transmitted in the mid-1920s. By the 1930s, the ABC was transmitting a number of British programs sourced from the BBC, and commercial stations were receiving a number of US programs, particularly dramas. However, in the 1940s, war-time restrictions made it difficult to access overseas programs and, therefore, the amount of Australian dramatic material increased. As well as using original ideas and scripts, there were a number of local versions of overseas programs. Initially, much of the music broadcast in Australia was from live studio concerts.  However, the amount of [[gramophone record|gramophone]] (and [[piano roll]]) music soon increased dramatically, particularly on commercial stations.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the number of big production variety shows multiplied significantly, particularly on the two major commercial networks, [[Macquarie Radio Network|Macquarie]] and [[Macquarie Radio Network|Major]]. After World War II the independent Colgate-Palmolive radio production unit was formed. It poached most major radio stars from the various stations. Until the 1950s, the popular image of the whole family seated around a set in the living room was the most accepted way of listening to radio. Therefore, most stations had to be all things to all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same.\n\n==== Early experiments with television ====\nAs early as 1929, two Melbourne commercial radio stations, [[3UZ]] and [[KIIS 101.1|3DB]] were conducting experimental mechanical television broadcasts \u2013 these were conducted in the early hours of the morning, after the stations had officially closed down. In 1934 Dr Val McDowall<ref>https://www.racp.edu.au/page/library/college-roll/college-roll-detail&id=496 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504062337/https://www.racp.edu.au/page/library/college-roll/college-roll-detail%26id%3D496 |date=2015-05-04 }}</ref> at amateur station [[4CM]] Brisbane<ref>{{cite web|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212637/s00855804_1961_1962_6_4_750.pdf,|title=eSpace - The University of Queensland|author=|date=|website=espace.library.uq.edu.au|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> conducted experiments in electronic television.\n\n==== Mobile stations ====\nTwo of Australia's most unusual medium wave stations were mobile stations 2XT and 3YB. They both operated in eras prior to the universal establishment of rural radio stations. 2XT was designed and operated by AWA within the State of [[New South Wales]], from a [[New South Wales Government Railways|NSW Railways]] train, between November 1925 and December 1927. 2XT, which stood for ''experimental train'', visited over 100 rural centres. Engineers would set up a transmitting aerial and the station would then begin broadcasting.  This led to the further sales of AWA products. 3YB provided a similar service in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] between October 1931 and November 1935. Initially, the station operated from a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] car and a Ford truck, but from 17 October 1932 they operated from a converted 1899 former Royal Train carriage. Whilst the engineers were setting up the station's 50-watt transmitter in the town being visited, salesmen would sign up advertisers for the fortnight that 3YB would broadcast from that region. The station was on the air from 6.00 and 10.00 pm daily, and its 1,000-record library was divided into set four-hour programs, one for each of 14 days. In other words, the music broadcast from each town was identical. The station was operated by Vic Dinenny, but named after announcer Jack '''Y'''oung from '''B'''allarat. On 18 January 1936, Dinenny set up [[3YB]] [[Warnambool]], followed on 18 May 1937 by [[3GG|3UL]] [[Warragul]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nThe [[merchant vessel]] [[HMAS Kanimbla (C78)|MV Kanimbla]] is believed to be the world's only ship built with an inbuilt broadcasting station. The Kanimlba was constructed in Northern Ireland in 1936 and was primarily designed for [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited]] to ply passengers between [[Cairns, Queensland]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia]]. The broadcasting station was constructed and operated by [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA]] and was initially given the [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] callsign VK9MI but was later 9MI. (At this time, the \"9\" in the callsign was aberrationary [see \"Call Signs, above].) The station made an experimental broadcast before leaving Northern Ireland, and a number of such broadcasts at sea, on the way to Australia. 9MI's first official broadcast in April 1939 was made from the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The station broadcast on [[short wave]], usually a couple of times per week, but many of its programs were relayed to commercial medium wave stations that were also owned by AWA. The 9MI manager and announcer (and probably the only member of staff) was Eileen Foley.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.offshore-radio.de/HansKnot/female.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811095008/http://www.offshore-radio.de/HansKnot/female.htm |archive-date=2004-08-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 9MI ceased broadcasting at the commencement of World War II in September 1939. The Kanimbla was commissioned as a [[Royal Navy]] (later [[Royal Australian Navy]]) vessel with the name HMS/HMAS Kanimbla.  It had an extremely prominent and successful war-time career.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.broadcasting-fleet.com/kanimbla.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209220510/http://broadcasting-fleet.com/kanimbla.htm |archive-date=2015-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{main|History of broadcasting in Canada}}\nThe history of broadcasting in Canada begins as early as 1919 with the first experimental broadcast programs in Montreal. Canadians were swept up in the radio craze and built crystal sets to listen to American stations while The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada offered its first commercially produced radio-broadcast receiver (Model \"C\") in 1921, followed by its \"Marconiphone\" Model I in 1923. Main themes in the history include the development of the engineering  technology; the construction of stations across the country and the building of networks; the widespread purchase and use of radio and television sets by the general public; debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations; financing of the broadcasts media through the government, license fees, and advertising; the changing content of the programming; the impact of the programming on Canadian identity; the media's influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics; the role of the Qu\u00e9bec government; Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes; the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations; fears of American cultural imperialism via the airwaves; and the impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media.<ref>Robert Armstrong, ''Broadcasting Policy in Canada'' (2013)</ref><ref>Marc Raboy, ''Missed Opportunities: The Story of Canada's Broadcasting Policy'' (1990)</ref>\n\nRadio signals carried long distances, and a number of American stations could easily be received in parts of Canada.  The first Canadian station was CFCF, originally an experimental station from the Marconi Company in Montreal.<ref>Mary Vipond, ''Listening In: The First Decade of Canadian Broadcasting 1922-1932'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1992)</ref> Civilian use of Wireless Telegraphy had been forbidden in Canada for the duration of World War I. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada was the only one to retain the right to continue radio experiments for military use.  This proved instrumental in giving the company a lead in developing an experimental radio broadcasting station immediately after the war. The first radio broadcast in Canada was accomplished by The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada in Montreal on December 1, 1919 under the call sign XWA (for \"Experimental Wireless Apparatus\") from its Williams Street factory. The station began regular programming on May 20, 1920 and its call letters were changed to CFCF on November 4, 1920.<ref>Murray R.P.\"The Early Development of Radio in Canada, 1901-1930: An Illustrated History\" (Robert P. Murray Editor, 2005)</ref> In Toronto, the first radio station was operated by the ''Toronto Star'' newspaper.  Station CKCE began in April 1922 and was so well received that the Star pushed forward with its own studios and transmitting facilities, returning to the air as CFCA in late June 1922.  In Montreal, another newspaper, ''La Presse'', put its own station, CKAC on the air in late September 1922.  Because there were governmental limitations on radio frequencies back then, CKAC and CFCF alternated\u2014one would broadcast one night, and the other would broadcast the night after that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=/listings_and_histories/radio/histories.php?id=495&historyID=246|title=Canadian Communications Foundation History of CKAC Radio|author=|date=|website=broadcasting-history.ca|accessdate=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422211234/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=%2Flistings_and_histories%2Fradio%2Fhistories.php%3Fid%3D495&historyID=246|archive-date=22 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> For a time, CKAC was broadcasting some programs in French, and some in English: in 1924, for example, the station rebroadcast fifteen Boston Bruins hockey games from station WBZ in Boston.  Meanwhile, in other Canadian provinces, 1922 was also the year for their first stations, including CJCE in Vancouver, and CQCA (which soon became CHCQ) in Calgary.\n\nAs radio grew in popularity during the mid-1920s, a problem arose:  the U.S. stations dominated the airwaves and with a limited number of frequencies available for broadcasters to use, it was the American stations that seemed to get most of them. This was despite an agreement with the US Department of Commerce (which supervised broadcasting in the years prior to the Federal Radio Commission) that a certain number of frequencies were reserved exclusively for Canadian signals. But if a US station wanted one of those frequencies, the Department of Commerce seemed unwilling to stop it, much to the frustration of Canadian owners who wanted to put stations on the air. The Canadian government and the US government began negotiations in late 1926, in hopes of finding a satisfactory solution.<ref>\"Canada Radio Fans Fight Interference.\" Tampa (FL) Tribune, January 16, 1927, p. 12D.</ref>  Meanwhile, in 1928, Canada got its first network, operated by the Canadian National Railways. CNR had already made itself known in radio since 1923, thanks in large part to the leadership of CNR's president, Sir Henry Thornton. The company began equipping its trains with radio receivers, and allowed passengers to hear radio stations from Canada and the US. In 1924, CN began building its own stations, and by 1928, it was able to create a network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_CNR.html|title=\"Canada's First Network.\"|author=|date=|website=broadcasting-history.ca|accessdate=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030330/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/timeline/index2.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadcasting-history.ca%2Fnetworks%2Fnetworks_CNR.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1932, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was formed, and in 1936, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the country's national radio service, made its debut.\n\n=== Cuba ===\nThere was interest in radio almost from broadcasting's earliest days. Due to the proximity of Cuba to the U.S. state of Florida, some Cubans would try to listen to the American stations whose signals reached the island. But there was no radio station in Cuba until 1922.  The arrival of the first radio station, PWX, was greeted with enthusiasm.<ref>\"Cuban Mill Hands Like Radio Jazz.\" Boston Herald, April 1, 1923, p. 12D.</ref> PWX, owned by the Cuban Telephone Company, was located in Havana.  It was a joint venture with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company of New York.

Before 1940, 14 commercial and 12 public sector radio stations were in operation. The government exerted tight control over radio broadcasting. Political debate was not encouraged. In the 1932 election campaign, for example, the opposition was allowed one broadcast while the incumbent made numerous campaign broadcasts.<ref>Paul Starr, ''The Creation of the Media: Political Origins of Modern Communications'' (2004), p 376</ref> Radio was a potentially powerful new medium, but France was quite laggard in consumer ownership of radio sets, With 5 million radio receivers in 1937, compared to over 8 million and both Britain and Germany, and 26 million in the United States. The government imposed very strict controls on news dissemination. After 1938, stations were allowed only three brief daily bulletins, of seven minutes each, to cover all the day's news. The Prime Minister's office closely supervised the news items that were to be broadcast.  As war approached, Frenchmen learned little or nothing about it from the radio. The government thought that policy wise, because it wanted no interference in its policies. The unexpected result, however, was the Frenchman were puzzled and uncertain great crises erupted in 1938\u201339, and their morale and support for government policies was much weaker than in Britain.<ref>Anthony Adamthwaite, ''Grandeur and Misery: France's Bid for Power in Europe 1914-1940'' (1995) p 177-78.</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe first radio station in Germany went on the air in Berlin in late 1923, using the call letters \"LP.\"<ref name=\"Now Numbers Many Millions 1923, p. 13\"/>  Before 1933,  German radio broadcasting was Conducted by 10 regional broadcasting monopolies, each of which had a government representative on its board. The Post Office Provided overall supervision.  A listening fee of 2 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] per receiver paid most costs, and radio station frequencies were limited, which even restricted the number of amateur radio operators. Immediately following Hitler's assumption of power in 1933, [[Joseph Goebbels]] became head of the Ministry for [[Propaganda]] and Public Enlightenment and took full control of broadcasting.  Non-Nazis were removed from broadcasting and editorial positions.  Jews were fired from all positions.<ref>Adelheid  von Saldern, \"Volk and Heimat culture in radio broadcasting during the period of transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (2004) 76#2 pp: 312-346. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/422932 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nGermany was easily served by a number of European mediumwave stations, including the [[BBC]], but the Nazis made it illegal for Germans to listen to foreign broadcasts.  During the war, German stations broadcast not only war propaganda and entertainment for German forces dispersed through Europe, as well as air raid alerts. There was heavy use of short wave for  \"Germany Calling\" programmes directed at Britain and Allied forces around the world.  Goebbels Also set up numerous Nazi stations that pretended to be from the Allied world.<ref>Horst J.P. Bergmeier and Rainer E. Lotz, ''Hitler's airwaves: the inside story of Nazi radio broadcasting and propaganda swing'' (Yale University Press, 1997)</ref> Germany experimented with television broadcasting, using a 180-line raster system beginning before 1935.  German propaganda claimed the system was superior to the British mechanical scanning system.\n\n=== Japan ===\nThe first radio station in Japan was JOAK, which opened in Tokyo in March 1925.  It was founded by Masajiro Kotamura, an inventor and engineer. It was unique in that at least one of its announcers was a woman, Akiko Midorikawa.<ref>\"Station JOAK of Japan.\" Boston Herald, April 11, 1926, p. 6.</ref> JOAK was followed soon after by JOBK in Osaka and JOCK in Nagoya.  The National Broadcasting Service, today known as NHK (Nippon Hoso Kyokai), began in August 1926. All stations were supported by licensing fees:  in 1926, for example, people wishing to receive a permit to own a radio set paid a fee of one yen a month to the government.<ref>\"Japan Hides Radio Artists.\" Seattle Daily Times, September 7, 1927, p. K4.</ref> Programming on Japanese stations of the 1920s included music, news, language instruction (lessons were offered in English, French and German) and educations talks.  These early stations broadcast on average about eight hours of programs a day.<ref>Carl H. Butman, \"Nippon Keeps Tight Grip on Radio.\"  Springfield Republican, September 11, 1927, p. 6C.</ref>\n\n=== Mexico ===\nAmateur radio was very popular in Mexico; while most of the hams were male, notably Constantino de Tarnava, acknowledged in some sources as Mexico's first amateur radio operator,<ref>Marvin Alinsky, ''International Handbook of Broadcasting Systems'', Greenwood Press, 1988, p. 215</ref> one of the early ham radio operators was female\u2014Maria Dolores Estrada.<ref>\"Mexican Girl Gets First Grade Commercial License.\" QST, January 1917, p. 49.</ref> But commercial radio was difficult to achieve, due to a federal regulation forbidding any broadcasts that were not for the benefit of the Mexican government. Still, in November 1923, CYL in Mexico City went on the air, featuring music (both folk songs and popular dance concerts), religious services, and news. CYL used as its slogans \"El Universal\" and \"La Casa del Radio\", and it won over the government, by giving political candidates the opportunity to use the station to campaign.<ref>Susan Haymes. \"A Junket to the Mexico City Studios of CYL.\" Radio Digest, November 14, 1925, pp. 7,12.</ref> Its signal was so powerful that it was even received in Canada sometimes.<ref>\"Novel Programs from CYL Mexico.\" Toronto Globe, December 9, 1925, p. 9.</ref> Pressure from listeners and potential station owners also contributed to the government relenting and allowing more stations to go on the air.<ref>Marvin Alinsky, ''International Handbook of Broadcasting Systems'', Greenwood Press, 1988, p. 216.</ref> In 1931, the \"C\" call letters were all changed to \"X\" call letters (XE being reserved for broadcasting), and by 1932, Mexico had nearly forty radio stations, ten of which were in Mexico City.<ref>\"Cuban and Mexican Broadcasters.\" Broadcasting magazine, January 15, 1932, p. 6.</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nOn 6 November 1919, the Dutch radio pioneer [[Hanso Idzerda|Hans Henricus Schotanus \u00e0 Steringa Idzerda]] started regular radio transmissions from [[The Hague]]. As these were regular transmissions and the program was announced beforehand in the newspaper [[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant|NRC]], this is seen as the start of commercial broadcasting.\n\n=== Philippines ===\nInterest in amateur radio was noted in the Philippines in the early 1920s.<ref>\"Signals Heard by Island.\" Portland Oregonian, March 15, 1925, p. 9</ref>  There were radio stations operating in the Philippines, including one owned by American businessman named Henry Hermann, as early as 1922, according to some sources; not much documentation about that period of time exists.  In the autumn of 1927, KZRM in Manila, owned by the Radio Corporation of the Philippines, went on the air.<ref>\"Manila Goes on the Air to Entertain the Orient.\" New York Times, October 2, 1927, p. XX18.</ref> The Radio Corporation of the Philippines was a subsidiary of American company RCA (Radio Corporation of America).<ref>\"To Open Manila Studio.\"  New York Times, February 13, 1927, p. E18.</ref> By 1932, the island had three radio stations: KRZC in Cebu, as well as KZIB (owned by a department store) and KZFM, the government-owned station in Manila. Of the stations listed by Pierre Key, KZFM was the strongest, with 50,000 watts.<ref>Pierre Key's Radio Annual, 1933 edition, pp. 269-270.</ref>  Two radio networks were ultimately created:  one, the Manila Broadcasting Company, began as a single station, KZRH in Manila, in July 1939, and after World War II, in 1946, the station's owners began to develop their network by buying other radio properties. As for the Philippine Broadcasting Company, it too began with one station (KZFM), and received its new name in mid-1946, after the Philippines became an independent country. At the end of 1946, the new network had six stations.<ref>\"KZPI Power Will Go to 10 KW on January 1.\"  Broadcasting Magazine, December 16, 1946, p. 30.</ref>  Both KZRH and KZFM also affiliated with American networks; the stations wanted to have access to certain popular American programs, and the American networks wanted to sell products in the Philippines.<ref>\"Advertisement for KZRH: The Voice of the Philippines.\" Broadcasting Magazine, December 16, 1946, p. 55.</ref>\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\n[[Sri Lanka]] has the oldest radio station in Asia (world's second oldest). The station was known as [[Radio Ceylon]]. It developed into one of the finest broadcasting institutions in the world. It is now known as the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]]. Sri Lanka created [[broadcasting]] history in Asia when broadcasting was started in Ceylon by the Telegraph Department in 1923 on an experimental footing, just three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe. Gramophone music was broadcast from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office with the aid of a small transmitter built by the Telegraph Department engineers from the radio equipment of a captured German submarine.<ref name=\"Transmitter\">{{cite web|title=For that Old Magic (Frontline Magazine, India)|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm|accessdate=2008-09-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918024249/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127001908700.htm|archivedate=2008-09-18}}</ref> This broadcasting experiment was successful; barely three years later, on December 16, 1925, a regular broadcasting service came to be instituted. Edward Harper who came to [[Ceylon]] as Chief Engineer of the Telegraph Office in 1921, was the first person to actively promote broadcasting in Ceylon. [[Sri Lanka]] occupies an important place in the history of broadcasting with broadcasting services inaugurated just three years after the launch of the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. [[Edward Harper (engineer)|Edward Harper]] launched the first experimental broadcast as well as founding the Ceylon Wireless Club, together with British and Ceylonese radio enthusiasts on the island. Edward Harper has been dubbed ' the Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon,' because of his pioneering efforts, his skill and his determination to succeed. Edward Harper and his fellow Ceylonese radio enthusiasts, made it happen.\n\n=== United Kingdom===\n[[File:INF3-49 Sir John Reith Artist Wooding.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature of Sir John Reith, by the artist, Wooding.]]\nThe first experimental music broadcasts, from [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi's]] factory in [[Chelmsford, England|Chelmsford]], began in 1920. Two years later, in October 1922, a consortium of radio manufacturers formed the [[British Broadcasting Company]] (BBC); they allowed some sponsored programs, although they were not what we would today consider a fully commercial station.  Meanwhile, the first radio stations in England were experimental station [[2MT]], located near Chelmsford, and station [[2LO]] in London:  both were operated by the Marconi Company.  By late 1923, there were six stations broadcasting regularly in the United Kingdom: London's 2LO, [[Manchester|Manchester's]] [[2ZY]], and stations in [[Birmingham]] ([[5IT]]), [[Cardiff]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], and [[Glasgow]].<ref name=\"Now Numbers Many Millions 1923, p. 13\">\"Radio Audience Now Numbers Many Millions.\" Springfield Republican, September 30, 1923, p. 13.</ref>  As for the consortium of radio manufacturers, it dissolved in 1926, when its license expired; it then became the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], a non-commercial organization. Its governors are appointed by the British government, but they do not answer to it. Lord [[John Charles Walsham Reith|Reith]] took a formative role in developing the BBC, especially in radio.<ref name=\"Lord Reith\">{{cite news |title=News article on Lord Reith in The Guardian Newspaper, London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/07/mediatop100200361|accessdate=2008-10-13 | date=2003-07-07}}</ref>  Working as its first manager and Director-General, he promoted the philosophy of ''[[public service broadcasting]]'', firmly grounded in the moral benefits of [[education]] and of uplifting [[entertainment]], eschewing [[commerce|commercial]] influence and maintaining a maximum of independence from political control.\n\nCommercial stations such as [[Radio Normandie]] and [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] broadcast into the UK from other European countries. This provided a very popular alternative to the rather austere BBC. These stations were closed during the War, and only Radio Luxembourg returned afterward. BBC television broadcasts in Britain began on November 2, 1936, and continued until [[World War II|wartime]] conditions closed the [[Service (economics)|service]] in 1939.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{main|Radio in the United States}}\n[[File:Fessenden.JPG|thumb|Reginald Fessenden, the ''father'' of radio broadcasting in the US.]]\n[[Reginald Fessenden]] did ground-breaking experiments with voice and music by 1906.<ref>Mike Adams, ''Lee de Forest, King of Radio, Television and Film''.

The early stations gained new call signs.  A few early stations, notably 8MK (later known as WWJ in Detroit) were started by newspapers, but in those early years, radio and newspapers regarded each other as competitors. One early station, 8XK in Pittsburgh, became [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in 1920; its ownership has asserted that it was the first radio station in the US, but that claim is controversial <ref>Donna Halper. \"When Broadcasting Really Began.\" The Broadcasters' Desktop Resource. November 2016.

KDKA received a commercial license and began broadcasting on November 2, 1920.\n\nMadison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. The United States never had a licensing fee for set users.<ref>Susan Smulyan, ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)</ref> The [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] began regular broadcasting in 1926, with telephone links between New York and other Eastern cities.  NBC became the dominant radio network, splitting into Red and Blue networks.  The [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] began in 1927 under the guidance of [[William S. Paley]].\n\nRadio in education began as early as April 1922, when Medford Hillside's WGI Radio broadcast the first of an ongoing series of educational lectures from Tufts College professors.  These lectures were described by the press as a sort of \"wireless college.\"<ref>\"Tufts College to Give Radio Lecture Course.\" Olympia (WA) Daily Recorder, March 25, 1922, p. 5.</ref>  Soon, other colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula; some, like the University of Iowa, even provided what today would be known as distance-learning credits.<ref>\"U of I Offers Full Credits in Air School.\" Rockford (IL) Daily Register, October 5, 1925, p.  4.</ref> [[Curry College]], first in Boston and then in Milton, Massachusetts, introduced one of the nation's first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs.

Prior to 1927, U.S. radio was supervised by the Department of Commerce.  Then, the Radio Act of 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission (FRC);<ref>\"The Radio Act.\" Central Law Journal, March 4, 1927, p. 158.</ref> in 1934, this agency became known as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). A [[Federal Communications Commission]] decision in 1939 required [[NBC]] to divest itself of its [[Blue Network]].  That decision was sustained by the Supreme Court in a 1943 decision, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, which established the framework that the \"scarcity\" of radio-frequency meant that broadcasting was subject to greater regulation than other media. This [[Blue Network]] network became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). Around 1946, ABC, NBC, and CBS began regular television broadcasts. Another TV network, the [[DuMont Television Network]], was founded earlier, but was disbanded in 1956; later in 1986 the surviving DuMont independent stations formed the nucleus of the new [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref name=\"DTNHWS\">[http://www.dumonthistory.tv/9.html DuMont Television Network Historical Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027143941/http://dumonthistory.tv/9.html |date=2010-10-27 }}.

He is remembered for founding [[Carols by Candlelight]], as a pioneer football commentator, and for hosting both musical and interview programs. In later years he was one of Melbourne's first and most prominent [[talk radio|talk back]] hosts. At the commencement of his career, Banks was known for his double entendres and risque remarks; as a talk back host he was outspoken in his conservative views, especially regarding the [[White Australia policy]] and [[Apartheid]].

It was then phased in to other capital cities, and then into rural markets. Many forms entertainment, particularly drama and variety, were considered more suited to television than radio, and many such programs were gradually deleted from radio schedules. \n[[File:Norman Banks Naomi Melwit 3KZ.jpg|thumb|right|Naomi (\"Joan\") Melwit and [[Norman Banks (broadcaster)|Norman Banks]] at the 3KZ microphone, in the late 1930s.]]\n\nThe [[transistor radio]] first appeared on the market in 1954. In particular, it made portable radios even more transportable. All sets quicklly became smaller, cheaper and more convenient. The aim of radio manufacturers became a radio in every room, in the car, and in the pocket. The upshot of these two changes was that stations started to specialise and concentrate on specific markets. The first areas to see specialised stations were the news and current affairs market, and stations specialising in [[pop music]] and geared toward the younger listener who was now able to afford his/her own radio. [[talk radio|Talk back]] (\"talk radio\") became a major radio genre by the end of the 1960s, but it was not legalised in Australia until October 1967.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Changing Stations \u2013 The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', Bridget Griffen-Foley, Sydney, 2009</ref> The fears of intrusion were addressed by a beep that occurred every few seconds, so that the caller knew that his/her call was being broadcast. There was also a seven-second delay so that obscene or libelous material could be monitored. By the end of the 1960s, specialisation by radio stations had increased dramatically and there were stations focusing on various kinds of music, talk back, news, sport, etc.\n\n=== Germany ===\nWhen the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was organized in 1949, its Enabling Act established strong state government powers.  Broadcasting was organized on a state, rather than a national, basis.  Nine regional radio networks were established.  A technical coordinating organization, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der \u00f6ffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (ARD), came into being in 1950 to lessen technical conflicts. The Allied forces in Europe developed their own radio networks, including the U.S. [[American Forces Network]] (AFN).

The Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon was hugely successful under the leadership of [[Clifford Dodd]], the Australian administrator and broadcasting expert who was sent to Ceylon under the [[Colombo Plan]]. Dodd hand picked some of the most talented radio presenters in South Asia.<ref name=\"Clifford Dodd\">{{cite web|title=Reference to Clifford Dodd in Mervyn Jayasuriya's article: The Three f's behind the microphone(The Island Newspaper) |url=http://lakdiva.com/island/i000102/feature.htm#The%20Three%20f%E2%80%99s%20behind%20the%20radio%20Ceylon%20Microphone |accessdate=2008-09-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720141129/http://lakdiva.com/island/i000102/feature.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2008 }}</ref>  They went on to enjoy star status in the Indian sub-continent. This was Radio Ceylon's golden era.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nRadio Luxembourg remained popular during the 1950s but saw its audience decline as commercial television and [[pirate radio]], combined with a switch to a less clear frequency, began to erode its influence. BBC television resumed on June 7, 1946, and commercial television began on September 22, 1955. Both used the pre-war [[405-line]] standard. BBC2 came on the air on April 20, 1964, using the 625-line standard, and began [[PAL]] colour transmissions on July 1, 1967,  the first in Europe. The two older networks transmitted in 625-line colour from 1969. During the 1960s there was still no UK-based commercial radio. A number of 'pirate' radio ships, located in international waters just outside the jurisdiction of English law, came on the air between 1964 and 1967. The most famous of these was [[Radio Caroline]], which was the only station to continue broadcasting after the offshore pirates were effectively outlawed on August 14, 1967 by the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]]. It was finally forced off air due to a dispute over tendering payments, but returned in 1972 and continued on and off until 1990. (The station subsequently broadcast legally, initially under 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence]]s and subsequently via satellite (since closed), internet streams, and (since 2017) a local AM transmitter.)\n\n=== United States ===\n[[Television]] began to replace radio as the chief source of revenue for broadcasting networks.  Although many radio programs continued through this decade, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[The Guiding Light]]'', by 1960 networks had ceased producing entertainment programs. As radio stopped producing formal fifteen-minute to hourly programs, a new format developed.  \"[[Top 40]]\" was based on a continuous rotation of short pop songs presented by a \"disc jockey.\"  Famous [[disc jockey]]s in the era included [[Alan Freed]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Don Imus]] and [[Wolfman Jack]].  Top 40 playlists were theoretically based on record sales; however, record companies began to [[bribe]] [[disc jockey]]s to play selected artists, in a controversy that was called \"[[payola]]\". In the 1950s, American television networks introduced broadcasts in color. The Federal Communications Commission approved the world's first monochrome-compatible color television standard in December 1953. The first network colorcast followed on January 1, 1954, with NBC transmitting the annual Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California to over 20 stations across the country. An educational television network, National Educational Television (NET), predecessor to [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], was founded. Shortwave broadcasting played an important part of fighting the cold war with Voice of America and the [[BBC]] World Service, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty transmitting through the \"[[Iron Curtain]]\", and Radio Moscow and others broadcasting back, as well as \"jamming\" (transmitting to cause intentional interference) the Western stations in the [[Soviet bloc]].\n\n== 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{main|History of broadcasting in Australia}}\n\n[[File:Australian Broadcasting Corporation logo (1974-).svg|thumb|The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] logo, first introduced in 1975 and based on the [[Lissajous curve]].]]\nAfter much procrastination on the part of various federal governments, [[FM broadcasting]] was eventually introduced in 1975. (There had been official experiments with FM broadcasting as far back as [[Timeline of Australian radio|1948]].) Only a handful of radio stations were given new licences during the 1940s, 50s & 60s but, since 1975, many hundreds of new broadcasting licences have been issued on both the FM and AM bands.  In the latter case, this was made possible by having 9&nbsp;kHz between stations, rather 10&nbsp;kHz breaks, as per the [[Geneva Frequency Plan]]. The installation of directional aerials also encouraged more AM stations. The type of station given FM licences reflects the policies and philosophies of the various Australian governments. Initially, only the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[community radio]] stations were granted FM licences.  However, after a change of government, commercial stations were permitted on the band, as from 1980. At first, one or two brand new stations were permitted in each major market. However, in 1990, one or two existing AM stations in each major market were given FM licences; the stations being chosen by an auction system. Apart from an initial settling-in period for those few stations transferred from AM to FM, there has been no simulcasting between AM and FM stations.\nIn major cities, a number of brand new FM licences were issued in the 1990s and 2000s. All rural regions which traditionally had only one commercial station now have at least one AM and one FM commercial station.  In many cases, the owner of the original station now has at least two outlets. The number of regional transmitters for the ABC's five networks also increased dramatically during this era.\n\n=== Europe ===\nCommercial radio (re-)legalisation in most European countries occurred in this era, starting with United Kingdom in 1973 (see [[Independent Local Radio]]) and ending with Austria in 1995.<br />\nIn 1987, stations in the [[European Broadcasting Union]] began offering [[Radio Data System|Radio Data System (RDS)]], which provides written text information about programs that were being broadcast,  as well as traffic alerts, accurate time, and other teletext services.<ref name=\"Radio Data System\">{{cite web |title=Radio Data System in the UK|url=http://www.radioandtelly.co.uk/rds.html|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nThe Government of Sri Lanka opened up the market in the late 1970s and 1980s allowing private companies to set up radio and television stations. Sri Lanka's public services broadcasters are the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC), Independent Television Net Work (ITN) and the affiliated radio station called Lak-handa. They had stiff competition on their hands with the private sector. Broadcasting in Sri Lanka went through a transformation resulting in private broadcasting institutions being set up on the island among them Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd (TNL), Maharaja Television \u2013 TV, Sirasa TV and Shakthi TV, and EAP Network (Pvt) Ltd \u2013 known as Swarnawahini \u2013 these private channels all have radio stations as well. The 1990s saw a new generation of radio stations being established in Sri Lanka among them the 'Hiru' radio station. In the 1980s public service broadcasters like the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] set up their own FM arm. Sri Lanka celebrated 80 years of broadcasting in December 2005. In January 2007 the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation celebrated 40 years as a public corporation.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nA new pirate station, Swiss-owned Radio Nordsee International, broadcast to Britain and the Netherlands from 1970 until outlawed by Dutch legislation in 1974 (which meant it could no longer be supplied from the European mainland). The English service was heavily jammed by both Labour and Conservative Governments in 1970 amid suggestions that the ship was actually being used for espionage. Radio Caroline returned in 1972 and continued until its ship sank in 1980 (the crew were rescued). A Belgian station, Radio Atlantis, operated an English service for a few months before the Dutch act came into force in 1974. Land-based commercial radio finally came on air in 1973 with London's [[LBC]] and [[Capital Radio]]. [[Channel 4]] television started in November 1982. Britain's UHF system was originally designed to carry only four networks. Pirate radio enjoyed another brief resurgence with a literal re-launch of Radio Caroline in 1983, and the arrival of American-owned [[Laser 558]] in 1985. Both stations were harassed by the British authorities; Laser closed in 1987 and Caroline in 1989, since then it has pursued legal methods of broadcasting, such as temporary FM licences and satellite. Two rival satellite television systems came on the air at the end of the 1980s: [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]] and [[British Satellite Broadcasting]]. Huge losses forced a rapid merger, although in many respects it was a takeover of BSB (Britain's official, Government-sanctioned satellite company) by Sky. Radio Luxembourg launched a 24-hour English channel on satellite, but closed its AM service in 1989 and its satellite service in 1991.\n\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] in UK law marked the establishment of two licensing authorities \u2013 the [[Radio Authority]] and the [[Independent Television Commission]] \u2013 to facilitate the licensing of non-[[BBC]] broadcast services, especially [[Restricted Service Licence|short-term broadcasts]]. [[Five (TV)|Channel 5]] went on the air on March 30, 1997, using \"spare\" frequencies between the existing channels.\n\n=== United States ===\nThe rise of [[frequency modulation|FM]] changed the listening habits of younger Americans.  Many stations such as WNEW-FM in New York City began to play whole sides of record albums, as opposed to the \"Top 40\" model of two decades earlier. In the 1980s, the [[Federal Communications Commission]], under Reagan Administration and Congressional pressure, changed the rules limiting the number of radio and television stations a business entity could own in one metropolitan area.  This [[deregulation]] led to several groups, such as [[Infinity Broadcasting]] and [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] to buy many stations in major cities.  The cost of these stations' purchases led to a conservative approach to broadcasting, including limited playlists and avoiding controversial subjects to not offend listeners, and increased commercials to increase revenue. AM radio declined throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to various reasons including: Lower cost of FM receivers, narrow AM audio bandwidth, and poor sound in the AM section of automobile receivers (to combat the crowding of stations in the AM band and a \"[[loudness war]]\" conducted by AM broadcasters), and increased radio noise in homes caused by fluorescent lighting and introduction of electronic devices in homes.  AM radio's decline flattened out in the mid-1990s due to the introduction of niche formats and over commercialization of many FM stations.\n\n== The 2000s ==\n[[File:A Kerbango.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The \"[[Kerbango]] Internet Radio\" was the first stand-alone product that let users listen to Internet radio without a computer.]]\nThe 2000s saw the introduction of [[digital radio]] and direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS) in the USA. Digital radio services, except in the United States, were allocated a new frequency band in the range of 1.4&nbsp;GHz. Regular shortwave broadcasts using Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), a digital broadcasting scheme for short and medium wave broadcasts have begun.  This system makes the normally scratchy international broadcasts clear and nearly FM quality, and much lower transmitter power.  This is much better to listen to and has more languages.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, from August 2009, digital radio was phased in by geographical region. Today, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], commercial and [[community radio]] stations operate on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and FM bands.  Most [[List of radio stations in Australia|stations]] are available on the [[internet]] and most also have [[digital radio|digital]] outlets. By 2007, there were 261 commercial stations in Australia.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The ABC currently has five AM/FM networks and is in the process of establishing a series of supplementary music stations that are only available on digital radios and [[digital television]] sets. SBS provides non-English language programs over its two networks, as do a number of community radio stations.\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] plans to move all Canadian broadcasting to the digital band and close all mediumwave and FM stations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== Europe ===\nEuropean stations have begun digital broadcasting ([[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]).  Digital radios began to be sold in the United Kingdom in 1998.\n\n=== Sri Lanka ===\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] in 2005 when Sri Lanka celebrated 80 years in Broadcasting, the former Director-General of the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]], Eric Fernando called for the station to take full advantage of the digital age \u2013 this included looking at the archives of [[Radio Ceylon]]. Ivan Corea asked the President of Sri Lanka, [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] to invest in the future of the SLBC.<ref name=\"Eighty Years\">{{cite web|title=Eighty Years in Broadcasting in Sri Lanka (Daily News, Colombo) |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/27/fea02.htm |accessdate=2008-09-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925204950/http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/27/fea02.htm |archivedate=2008-09-25 }}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, this band was deemed to be vital to national defense, so an alternate band in the range of 2.3&nbsp;GHz was introduced for satellite broadcasting.  Two American companies, [[XM Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]], introduced DBS systems, which are funded by direct subscription, as in [[cable television]].  The XM and Sirius systems provide approximately 100 channels each, in exchange for monthly payments. In addition, a consortium of companies received FCC approval for In-Band On-Channel digital broadcasts in the United States, which use the existing mediumwave and FM bands for transmission.  However, early IBOC tests showed interference problems with adjacent channels, which has slowed adoption of the system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[AM broadcasting#History]]\n* [[FM broadcasting#History]]\n* [[Oldest radio station]]\n* [[Oldest television station]]\n* [[Birth of public radio broadcasting]]\n* [[Women in early radio]]\n* [[History of advertising]]\n* [[History of radio]]\n* [[Timeline of radio]]\n* [[Timeline of the introduction of radio in countries]]\n* [[Radio broadcasting]]\n* [[History of telecommunication]]\n* [[History of television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Briggs Asa.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Vivica A. Fox]] and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch an all-out counterattack on July 4&mdash;[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film while answering a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and [[Dean Devlin]] decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nNow considered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in [[limited release]] as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]]. A sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, making up the first part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1995, an enormous [[mothership]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each with a fifteen-mile radius, that take positions over 36 of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore of the attack. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers fire [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beams]] into the ground, causing massive walls of fire that kill millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as Washington is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.\n\nOn July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters with their own shield as well, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, an F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they have learned that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invading Okun's mind and killing all the other doctors. It uses Okun's vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore, before launching a [[psychic]] attack against him. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he saw in the aliens' plans. He says that invaders are like locusts; their whole civilization travels from one planet to the next, stripping them of all their natural resources. The President reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact. Meanwhile, Steven's fianc\u00e9e Jasmine and her son survive the destruction of Los Angeles, and use an abandoned service truck to rescue other survivors, in the process finding the injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Marilyn, whose helicopter crashed during the initial attack. Though the group is rescued by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies of the severity of her wounds shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their shields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a [[computer virus|virus]] into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space and entering the alien invaders' [[mother ship]], Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, nullifying the aliens' [[communications system]] and reinforcements, before the malware filtered into the alien ships above Earth. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile jams, he [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing the entire ship to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]], destroying it. Human [[military]] forces around the world are notified of the alien ships' critical point, and successfully destroy the others. As humanity is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership exploding, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.

A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 8.</ref><ref name=\"EW7\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292721,00.html The 1996 Summer Movie Preview: July] ''Entertainment Weekly''.

The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72.</ref> The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a {{Convert|30|ft|adj=mid}} destroyer model<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 54.</ref> and a version of the mother ship spanning {{convert|12|ft}}.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 121.</ref> City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards.

Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] on the [[Plains of San Agustin]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name= \"Aberly and Engel p. 91\"/> The main crew also filmed in nearby [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey]] before moving to the former [[Kaiser Ventures|Kaiser Steel mill]] in [[Fontana, California]] to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 62.</ref> The production then moved to [[Wendover, Utah]], and [[West Wendover, Nevada]],<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 104.</ref> where the deserts doubled for [[Imperial Valley]], and the [[Wendover Airport]] doubled for the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]] and Area 51 exteriors.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 96.</ref> It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''[[Independence Day (1983 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1983) and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass; but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker [[mockup]] {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\"/> that took four months to build.<ref name=\"EW\"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name=\"ID43\"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe film originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name=\"dvd\"/> and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A \"Independence Day.\"] ''amazon.ca''.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Will Smith]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Margaret Colin]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[James Rebhorn]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Vivica A. Fox]] and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the [[Great Basin Desert|Nevada desert]] in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial race]] of unknown origin. With the other people of the world, they launch an all-out counterattack on July 4&mdash;[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the United States.\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film while answering a question about his own belief in the existence of alien life. He and [[Dean Devlin]] decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nNow considered a significant turning point in the history of the [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], ''Independence Day'' was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. The film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in [[limited release]] as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[1996 in film|highest-grossing film of 1996]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film ever at the time]]<!-- Peak position only. -->, behind ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993). The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing]]. A sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, making up the first part of a planned [[Independence Day (franchise)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 2, 1995, an enormous [[mothership]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each with a fifteen-mile radius, that take positions over 36 of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an [[MIT]]-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, [[White House Communications Director]] Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius gain access to the [[Oval Office]] and warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore of the attack. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers fire [[directed-energy weapons|destructive beams]] into the ground, causing massive walls of fire that kill millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as Washington is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.\n\nOn July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their [[military aviation|air forces]] attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters with their own shield as well, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, an F/A-18 jet pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] squadron [[VMFA-314]] based out of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]], survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the [[Grand Canyon]] and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to [[Area 51]], where Whitmore's group has landed. Through [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Albert Nimzicki, they have learned that a faction of the government has been involved in a [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy]] since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks, [[Telepathy|telepathically]] invading Okun's mind and killing all the other doctors. It uses Okun's vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore, before launching a [[psychic]] attack against him. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he saw in the aliens' plans. He says that invaders are like locusts; their whole civilization travels from one planet to the next, stripping them of all their natural resources. The President reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above [[Houston]], but the saucer remains intact. Meanwhile, Steven's fianc\u00e9e Jasmine and her son survive the destruction of Los Angeles, and use an abandoned service truck to rescue other survivors, in the process finding the injured [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], Marilyn, whose helicopter crashed during the initial attack. Though the group is rescued by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies of the severity of her wounds shortly after being reunited with her family.\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their shields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a [[computer virus|virus]] into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through [[Morse code]] to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space and entering the alien invaders' [[mother ship]], Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, nullifying the aliens' [[communications system]] and reinforcements, before the malware filtered into the alien ships above Earth. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile jams, he [[kamikaze|rams]] his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing the entire ship to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]], destroying it. Human [[military]] forces around the world are notified of the alien ships' critical point, and successfully destroy the others. As humanity is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership exploding, resembling a [[fireworks]] display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast listing, as shown in the film's end credits.

A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 8.</ref><ref name=\"EW7\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292721,00.html The 1996 Summer Movie Preview: July] ''Entertainment Weekly''. Retrieved July 8, 2008.</ref>\n\nEmmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that \"for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field \u2026[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head.\"<ref name=\"ID42\">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 93.</ref> Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, \"would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?\"<ref name=\"ID42\"/> The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico,<ref name=\"ID41\" /> and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, [[20th Century Fox]] chairman [[Peter Chernin]] greenlit the screenplay.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.<ref name=\"dvd\"/><ref name=\"ID41\"/> The [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's [[Area 51]] references.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nA then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.<ref name=\"EW7\"/> The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than [[Digimation|computer-generated effects]] in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Many of these shots were accomplished at [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]] in [[Culver City, California]], where the film's art department, [[motion control photography]] teams, [[pyrotechnics]] team, and model shop were headquartered{{doubtful|date=July 2018}}.

A second unit gathered plate shots and [[establishing shot]]s of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] community in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], and the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] on the [[Plains of San Agustin]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name= \"Aberly and Engel p. 91\"/> The main crew also filmed in nearby [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey]] before moving to the former [[Kaiser Ventures|Kaiser Steel mill]] in [[Fontana, California]] to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 62.</ref> The production then moved to [[Wendover, Utah]], and [[West Wendover, Nevada]],<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 104.</ref> where the deserts doubled for [[Imperial Valley]], and the [[Wendover Airport]] doubled for the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro]] and Area 51 exteriors.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 96.</ref> It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''[[Independence Day (1983 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1983) and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass; but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker [[mockup]] {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref name=\"Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72\"/> that took four months to build.<ref name=\"EW\"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name=\"ID43\"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nThe film originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name=\"dvd\"/> and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".<ref>[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A \"Independence Day.\"] ''amazon.ca''.
