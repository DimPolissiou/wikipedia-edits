David White, the township's first supervisor and a pioneer settler. At the time of founding, Whiteford Township was a much larger township in land area than it is today. It originally extended into present-day Ohio, when that part of the state (known as the Toledo Strip) was claimed by both Ohio and Michigan during the [[Toledo War]].<ref>1834 Map.  From the 1876 Township Plat Map and 1880 Federal Census Index of Whiteford Township.</ref> This larger Whiteford Township included most of present-day Sylvania, Sylvania Township, northern Springfield Township and a small section of present-day Toledo north of Airport Highway between Reynolds Road and Holland-Sylvania. However, by December 1836, the boundary dispute between Ohio and Michigan had been settled, the Toledo Strip was awarded to Ohio, and Whiteford Township subsequently lost all of its territory south of this newly agreed upon state boundary.\n\nThroughout the mid and late 19th Century, most of the land in the township was used agriculturally with many of the square-mile sections divided up into parcels of 40 to 160 acres.  In 1880, over 95% of the householders residing there were occupied as farmers or farm laborers. Merchants and manufacturers could be found in the unincorporated settlements of Whiteford Center and Ottawa Lake, the latter being home to a large stave mill in which residents were employed during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nIn 1880, the total population of the township was 2044 of which 2030 residents were classified as White and 14 were listed as Black/Mulatto. By 1900 the population had risen to 2050, with all residents listed as White.<ref>Census Enumeration Data, 1880 and 1900</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|40.24|sqmi|km2|2}}, of which {{convert|39.72|sqmi|km2|2}} is land and {{convert|0.52|sqmi|km2}} (1.29%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 4,420 people, 1,582 households, and 1,243 families residing in the township.  The [[population density]] was 111.0 per square mile (42.8/km\u00b2).  There were 1,654 housing units at an average density of 41.5 per square mile (16.0/km\u00b2).

It is part of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u201320 worldwide coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\nPuerto Rico started addressing the risks of an outbreak early on.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. The governor expressing concern that the curfew established on the 12th was not being followed took stronger actions and asked all non-essential businesses be closed as of March 15 through March 30.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.

It is part of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u201320 worldwide coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\nPuerto Rico started addressing the risks of an outbreak early on. The island took \"some of the most dramatic steps of any U.S. jurisdiction to control the virus,\" and \"several U.S. cities and states followed Puerto Rico\u2019s lead, imposing curfews and shutting businesses\" of their own.<ref>[https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241295696.html ''Puerto Rico seeks to suspend all incoming flights to battle COVID-19 spread.''] Jim Wyss. Miami Herald. March 18, 2020. Accessed 17 April 2020.</ref> On February 29, [[Puerto Rico]] governor [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]] established a task force to look into how the virus could affect Puerto Rico and to lay out plans on how to best mitigate any outbreaks. Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. The governor expressing concern that the curfew established on the 12th was not being followed took stronger actions and asked all non-essential businesses be closed as of March 15 through March 30.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.
