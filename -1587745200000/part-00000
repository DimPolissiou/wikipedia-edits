Nine years later, and now working as a detective for the NYPD, a case leads her to discover that Vincent Keller, an ex-soldier believed to have been killed in action during military service, is actually alive. As Catherine gets to know him, she starts finding out more about her mother's murder and about who (and what) Vincent really is. At the same time, they get to know one another and eventually fall in love.\n\n===Plot===\nThis season revolves around Catherine and Vincent trying to pursue a relationship together, whilst being hunted down by a top-secret government organization named Muirfield who want Vincent dead. Muirfield are revealed to have conducted a high-profile secret experiment on soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. These experiments resulted in every soldier becoming physically stronger and faster, hoping this would win the war quicker. But, something went wrong, as the entire force went out of control with their new abilities. The government gave orders to kill them all, but Vincent escaped and has been in hiding ever since. Muirfield make several attempts to capture Vincent during this season, and even enlist the help of Cat and those close to her to capture him.\n\nCatherine's family history is delved into in this first season, as her mother's unsolved murder has preyed on her mind for nine years. Catherine witnessed her mother shot and killed by two hitmen who were then killed by Vincent. Catherine refused to believe the official police report that her mother's death was that of carjacking gone wrong since the men who killed her mother suddenly appeared and began shooting without saying a word, as well as that the two dead killers identities were never found in any police record, leading Catherine to believe that her mother's killing was that of a government conspiracy. It was later revealed that Catherine's mother worked for Muirfield, conducting the experiments, and ultimately helped turn Vincent into a beast. Catherine must deal with conflicted feelings of her mother's memory across this season, having been determined to solve her case for all this time. When Catherine watches her father get run over in the season finale, she then learns that, biologically, he was not her real father after all.\n\nVincent's DNA mutates as the season progresses, as he becomes more beast-like. He begins experiencing black-outs, which J.T. associates with Catherine's interference. Cat and Vincent will stop at nothing to see each other, however. Assistant District Attorney Gabriel Lowen visits Cat's precinct to investigate the beast-like attack in the city and over time he reveals that not only does he know about Muirfield but that he shares the same ability as Vincent. At first an enemy, Gabriel goes on to become an ally to Vincent by the end of the first season and suggests he has found a cure to the virus inflicted on them by Muirfield. Vincent ultimately wonders if he wants to be cured or not.\n\nVincent is captured in the season finale as a helicopter drops a net on him and flies him away, leaving Catherine heartbroken. With Vincent captured, a gun is then aimed at Catherine's head. But, someone orders them not to shoot; Agent Bob Reynolds \u2013Catherine's biological father.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Beauty & the Beast (2012 TV series) characters}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Main===\n*[[Kristin Kreuk]] as Catherine \"Cat\" Chandler\n*[[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]] as Vincent Keller\n*[[Max Brown (actor)|Max Brown]] as Evan Marks{{efn|Brown was credited as main cast from episodes 1-18.}}\n*[[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] as Gabriel Lowan{{efn|Ramamurthy was credited as main cast from episodes 15-22.}}\n*[[Austin Basis]] as J.T.

Nine years later, and now working as a detective for the NYPD, a case leads her to discover that Vincent Keller, an ex-soldier believed to have been killed in action during military service, is actually alive. As Catherine gets to know him, she starts finding out more about her mother's murder and about who (and what) Vincent really is. At the same time, they get to know one another and eventually fall in love.\n\n===Plot===\nThis season revolves around Catherine and Vincent trying to pursue a relationship together, whilst being hunted down by a top-secret government organization named Muirfield who want Vincent dead. Muirfield are revealed to have conducted a high-profile secret experiment on soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. These experiments resulted in every soldier becoming physically stronger and faster, hoping this would win the war quicker. But, something went wrong, as the entire force went out of control with their new abilities. The government gave orders to kill them all, but Vincent escaped and has been in hiding ever since. Muirfield make several attempts to capture Vincent during this season, and even enlist the help of Cat and those close to her to capture him.\n\nCatherine's family history is delved into in this first season, as her mother's unsolved murder has preyed on her mind for nine years. Catherine witnessed her mother shot and killed by two hitmen who were then killed by Vincent. Catherine refused to believe the official police report that her mother's death was that of carjacking gone wrong since the men who killed her mother suddenly appeared and began shooting without saying a word, as well as that the two dead killers identities were never found in any police record, leading Catherine to believe that her mother's killing was that of a government conspiracy. It was later revealed that Catherine's mother worked for Muirfield, conducting the experiments, and ultimately helped turn Vincent into a beast. Catherine must deal with conflicted feelings of her mother's memory across this season, having been determined to solve her case for all this time. When Catherine watches her father get run over in the season finale, she then learns that, biologically, he was not her real father after all.\n\nVincent's DNA mutates as the season progresses, as he becomes more beast-like. He begins experiencing black-outs, which J.T. associates with Catherine's interference. Cat and Vincent will stop at nothing to see each other, however. Assistant District Attorney Gabriel Lowen visits Cat's precinct to investigate the beast-like attack in the city and over time he reveals that not only does he know about Muirfield but that he shares the same ability as Vincent. At first an enemy, Gabriel goes on to become an ally to Vincent by the end of the first season and suggests he has found a cure to the virus inflicted on them by Muirfield. Vincent ultimately wonders if he wants to be cured or not.\n\nVincent is captured in the season finale as a helicopter drops a net on him and flies him away, leaving Catherine heartbroken. With Vincent captured, a gun is then aimed at Catherine's head. But, someone orders them not to shoot; Agent Bob Reynolds \u2013Catherine's biological father.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Beauty & the Beast (2012 TV series) characters}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Main===\n*[[Kristin Kreuk]] as Catherine \"Cat\" Chandler\n*[[Jay Ryan (actor)|Jay Ryan]] as Vincent Keller\n*[[Max Brown (actor)|Max Brown]] as Evan Marks{{efn|Brown was credited as main cast from episodes 1-18.}}\n*[[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] as Gabriel Lowan{{efn|Ramamurthy was credited as main cast from episodes 15-22.}}\n*[[Austin Basis]] as J.T.

He was named after his maternal grandfather, King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nThe circumstances surrounding Wenceslaus's childhood and adolescence are unknown. The first attested presence of the young heir of Legnica-Brieg was in 1329, when he, alongside his father, paid homage to King [[John of Luxemburg]], his uncle, husband of his maternal aunt [[Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292\u20131330)|Elisabeth]].\n\n===Co-ruler===\nBoles\u0142aw III's free spending way infuriated Wenceslaus, who, worried about the fate of the family's patrimony. This prompted Wenceslaus to rebel against his father. Boles\u0142aw III didn't want to fight with his son, and so gave to him the Duchy of [[Namys\u0142\u00f3w]] as an independent fief, in 1338. Four years later (1342), Boles\u0142aw III decided to abdicate all his lands to his two surviving sons - Wenceslaus and his younger brother [[Louis I of Brzeg]] - in exchange for Namys\u0142\u00f3w, which was almost immediately sold by Boles\u0142aw III to King [[Casimir III the Great]]. Together with his second wife, Katharina \u0160ubi\u0107, Boles\u0142aw III retired to the small towns of  [[Duchy of Brzeg|Brieg]] and [[O\u0142awa]], where he retained residences.\n\nThe two brothers initially decided to [[co-ruler|co-rule]] without any land divisions, in order to pay the huge debts of the duchy. The resources of Legnica were minimal, because their eccentric father had sold several productive parcels of land. Even the extraction of gold from the mines of [[Miko\u0142ajowice, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Miko\u0142ajowice]] proved insufficient.\n\nIn 1345, the brothers decided upon a formal division of their authority and rule. Louis convince his older brother to ceded him the overlordship of Legnica in exchange for the towns of [[Z\u0142otoryja]], [[Chojn\u00f3w]], [[Chocian\u00f3w]] and [[Lubin|Lubin (L\u00fcben)]].\n\n===Consolidation of power===\nHowever, within one year, Wenceslaus changed his mind, believing the division of the Duchy of Legnica to be inherently inequitable. Two reasons motivated him: he was seriously ill, and after eight years of childless marriage, his wife was expecting their first child. Wenceslaus claimed all the inheritance of Legnica; in exchange, he promised to name Louis as his sole heir, even if his unborn child was a son. Louis agreed and resigned his lands to Wenceslaus. In exchange, he received monetary compensation of 400 pieces of silver ''per year'' and the possession of the palace of [[Buczyna, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Buczyna]].\n\nThe unexpected renunciation by Louis, without a fight, may have been motivated by his belief that his brother was dying, and that he would soon regain Legnica. However, with time, it became apparent that Wenceslaus, despite his illness, was not dying. The situation was further complicated by the birth of the first of Wenceslaus's four sons, Rupert.\n\nLouis sought to annul his resignation on the basis that the promised annual compensation was not paid, but without success. The situation remained in an unstable peace until the death of Boles\u0142aw III (21 April 1352), which resulted in a civil war between the brothers.\n\n===Period of Conflict===\nDespite attempts at mediation by Duke [[Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica]], [[Przec\u0142aw von Pogarell]], Bishop of [[Wroclaw]], and [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]], the war continued for six years, during which time both sides won and lost advantage. The war ended in July 1359, when a settlement was reached between the brothers. In that settlement, Wenceslaus \u2013 who lost the final battle \u2013 was compelled to give to Louis the districts of [[Brzeg]]-[[O\u0142awa]] (which returned to him after the death of their stepmother, [[Katharina \u0160ubi\u0107]]) and [[Chojn\u00f3w]] as an independent Duchy (however, one half of Brzeg-O\u0142awa, with Byczyna, were already sold by Wenceslaus to Duke [[Bolko II the Small|Bolko II of \u015awidnica]]). An additional concession by Wenceslaus was the payment of 4,500 pieces of silver to his younger brother, as compensation for damages.\n\nIn addition to the conflict with his brother, Wenceslaus was also involved in promoting the rule of the [[House of Luxemburg]] in [[Silesia]]. In 1348 he represented the Emperor as a mediator in a dispute between the Bishop of Wroclaw, Przec\u0142aw von Pogarell, and the local nobility. In February 1348, Wenceslaus was part of the entourage who accompanied Emperor Charles IV, when he traveled to [[Bautzen]] in order to arrange a meeting with [[Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen|Frederick II]], Margrave of [[Meissen]] and Langrave of [[Thuringia]] with the purpose of settling their frontier disputes. Eleven years later, in 1360, Wenceslaus was again a mediator in the  dispute between Duke Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica and Duke [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn|Przemyslaus I of Cieszyn (Teschen)]] over the control of the Duchy of [[Bytom]]-[[Ko\u017ale]].\n\n===Final years===\nDuring the entire period of his reign, Wenceslaus was confronted with the financial difficulties of his Duchy. The lands and property that he had inherited from his father, Duke Boles\u0142aw III, came with enormous debts attached. In an effort to manage this debt, Wenceslaus was forced to rent out large portions of his Duchy to neighboring Princes and Bishops, and even ordinary Knights and townspeople.\n\nDespite the disastrous financial situation of Legnica, Wenceslaus embarked upon several costly ventures, in an effort to raise the prestige of the Duchy, and himself. He founded a Benedictine monastery and Kolegiate in Legnica called \"Church of God\" (pl: ''Bo\u017cego Grobu''), and ordered the creation of a gold coin called a \"''wac\u0142awki''\", which was circulated throughout the realm.\n\nWenceslaus died on 2 June 1364 and was buried in the Church of God in Legnica, which was then under construction. His excommunication, as a punishment for unpaid debts, led to major complications. It was not until 1365 that his sons finally obtained a pardon for him. Wenceslaus's ornate tombstone remains intact, and is currently maintained in the Legnica Cathedral.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nBy 1338, Wenceslaus married with Anna (b. ca. 1325 \u2013 d. 1367), daughter of Duke [[Casimir I, Duke of Cieszyn|Casimir I of Cieszyn]]. They had five children:\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n#[[Rupert I of Legnica|Rupert I]] (b. 27 March 1347 \u2013 d. bef. 12 January 1409).\n#[[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]] (b. 1348 \u2013 d. 30 December 1419).\n#[[Boles\u0142aw IV of Legnica|Boles\u0142aw IV]] (b. ca. 1349 \u2013 d. 3/4 March 1394).\n#[[Hedwig of Legnica|Hedwig]] (b. ca. 1351 \u2013 d. 1 August 1409), married on 10 February 1372 to [[Henry VI the Older|Henry VI, Duke of G\u0142og\u00f3w-\u017baga\u0144]].\n#[[Henry VIII of Legnica|Henry VIII]] (b. ca. 1355 \u2013 d. 12 December 1398).\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast5.html#W1 |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast-Silesia |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#WenzelILiegnitzdied1364 |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*''This article was translated by his Polish Wikipedia version''.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]|circa|1318|2 June|1364}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Namys\u0142\u00f3w]]|years=1338\u20131342}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Legnica]]<br/>''with Louis I''|years=1342\u20131345}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Legnica]]|years=1346\u20131364}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Rupert I of Legnica|Rupert I]]<br/> [[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]]<br/> [[Boles\u0142aw IV of Legnica|Boles\u0142aw IV]]<br/> [[Henry VIII of Legnica|Henry VIII]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Katharina \u0160ubi\u0107 of Croatia|Katharina]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Brzeg]]|years=1358}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Bolko II the Small]]<br/> and [[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]}}\n{{end}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wenceslaus 01 Of Legnica}}\n[[Category:1318 births]]\n[[Category:1364 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Brzeg]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Legnica]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=November 2018}}\n\n{{ infobox nobility\n| name         = Wenceslaus I\n| image        = Wac\u0142aw I legnicki - Anna cieszy\u0144ska.jpg\n| image_size   = 200px\n| caption      = Wenceslaus I of Legnica with his wife Anna of Cieszyn\n| noble family = [[Silesian Piasts]]\n| father       = [[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]\n| mother       = [[Margaret of Bohemia (1296-1322)|Margaret of Bohemia]]\n| spouse       = Anna of Cieszyn\n| issue        = [[Rupert I of Legnica]]<br>[[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]]<br>[[Boles\u0142aw IV of Legnica]]<br>[[Hedwig of Legnica]]<br>[[Henry VIII of Legnica]]\n| birth_date   = ca. 1318\n| birth_place  = \n| death_date   = 2 June 1364\n| death_place  = \n}}\n\n'''Wenceslaus I, Duke of Legnica''' ({{lang-pl|'''Wac\u0142aw I legnicki'''}}) (ca. 1318 \u2013 2 June 1364) was a Duke of [[Namys\u0142\u00f3w]] from 1338 and of [[Legnica]]-[[Duchy of Brzeg|Brieg]] from 1342 until his death, but with further divisions with his brother Louis I.\nHe was the eldest son of [[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]], Duke of [[Legnica]]-[[Duchy of Brzeg|Brieg]] by his first wife, [[Margaret of Bohemia (1296-1322)|Margaret of Bohemia]].

In February 1348, Wenceslaus was part of the entourage who accompanied Emperor Charles IV, when he traveled to [[Bautzen]] in order to arrange a meeting with [[Frederick II, Margrave of Meissen|Frederick II]], Margrave of [[Meissen]] and Langrave of [[Thuringia]] with the purpose of settling their frontier disputes. Eleven years later, in 1360, Wenceslaus was again a mediator in the  dispute between Duke Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica and Duke [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn|Przemyslaus I of Cieszyn (Teschen)]] over the control of the Duchy of [[Bytom]]-[[Ko\u017ale]].\n\n===Final years===\nDuring the entire period of his reign, Wenceslaus was confronted with the financial difficulties of his Duchy. The lands and property that he had inherited from his father, Duke Boles\u0142aw III, came with enormous debts attached. In an effort to manage this debt, Wenceslaus was forced to rent out large portions of his Duchy to neighboring Princes and Bishops, and even ordinary Knights and townspeople.\n\nDespite the disastrous financial situation of Legnica, Wenceslaus embarked upon several costly ventures, in an effort to raise the prestige of the Duchy, and himself. He founded a Benedictine monastery and Kolegiate in Legnica called \"Church of God\" (pl: ''Bo\u017cego Grobu''), and ordered the creation of a gold coin called a \"''wac\u0142awki''\", which was circulated throughout the realm.\n\nWenceslaus died on 2 June 1364 and was buried in the Church of God in Legnica, which was then under construction. His excommunication, as a punishment for unpaid debts, led to major complications. It was not until 1365 that his sons finally obtained a pardon for him. Wenceslaus's ornate tombstone remains intact, and is currently maintained in the Legnica Cathedral.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nBy 1338, Wenceslaus married with Anna (b. ca. 1325 \u2013 d. 1367), daughter of Duke [[Casimir I, Duke of Cieszyn|Casimir I of Cieszyn]]. They had five children:\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n#[[Rupert I of Legnica|Rupert I]] (b. 27 March 1347 \u2013 d. bef. 12 January 1409).\n#[[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]] (b. 1348 \u2013 d. 30 December 1419).\n#[[Boles\u0142aw IV of Legnica|Boles\u0142aw IV]] (b. ca. 1349 \u2013 d. 3/4 March 1394).\n#[[Hedwig of Legnica|Hedwig]] (b. ca. 1351 \u2013 d. 1 August 1409), married on 10 February 1372 to [[Henry VI the Older|Henry VI, Duke of G\u0142og\u00f3w-\u017baga\u0144]].\n#[[Henry VIII of Legnica|Henry VIII]] (b. ca. 1355 \u2013 d. 12 December 1398).\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast5.html#W1 |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast-Silesia |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#WenzelILiegnitzdied1364 |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*''This article was translated by his Polish Wikipedia version''.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]|circa|1318|2 June|1364}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Namys\u0142\u00f3w]]|years=1338\u20131342}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Legnica]]<br/>''with Louis I''|years=1342\u20131345}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Dukes of Silesia|Duke of Legnica]]|years=1346\u20131364}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Rupert I of Legnica|Rupert I]]<br/> [[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]]<br/> [[Boles\u0142aw IV of Legnica|Boles\u0142aw IV]]<br/> [[Henry VIII of Legnica|Henry VIII]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Katharina \u0160ubi\u0107 of Croatia|Katharina]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Brzeg]]|years=1358}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Bolko II the Small]]<br/> and [[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]}}\n{{end}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wenceslaus 01 Of Legnica}}\n[[Category:1318 births]]\n[[Category:1364 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Brzeg]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Legnica]]\n", "name_user": "ArisMethymna", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I_of_Legnica"}

Following the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] on 6 December 1921, the IRA in the 26 counties that were to become the [[Irish Free State]] split between supporters and opponents of the Treaty. The '''anti-Treatyites''', sometimes referred to by [[Free Stater (Ireland)|Free State forces]] as '''Irregulars''',{{Ref|NoteA|A}} continued to use the name '''Irish Republican Army''' ('''IRA''') or in [[Irish language|Irish]] '''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''', as did the organisation in [[Northern Ireland]] which originally supported the pro-Treaty side (if not the Treaty).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/sectarian-violence-and-murder-spreads-across-the-north-199309.html|title=Sectarian violence and murder spreads across the North|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/michael-collins-and-anti-treaty-side-did-deal-to-encourage-trouble-in-north-1.1949924|title=Michael Collins and anti-Treaty side did deal to encourage trouble in North|date=3 October 2014|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref> ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' was also adopted as the name of the pro-Treaty [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]], and remains the official legal title of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Irish Defence Forces]].<ref>''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann'' is the legal name of the Irish Defence Force - Section 3, Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923. also Section 16, Defence Act 1954.</ref> This article deals with the anti-Treaty IRA that fought against the Irish Free State in the [[Irish Civil War]], and with its successors up to 1969, when the IRA split again.\n\n==The \"Old IRA\" split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty==\n{{See also|IRA and the Anglo-Irish Treaty}}\n\nThe signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty by the Irish delegation in London caused an angry reaction among the less compromising elements in [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and among a majority of the IRA. [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (1919-1922)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] ratified the Treaty by 64 votes to 57 after a lengthy and acrimonious debate, following which President [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] resigned. Sinn F\u00e9in split between pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty factions, and the Army did likewise. The majority of headquarters staff, many of whom were close to [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], supported the Treaty, but opinion among IRA volunteers was divided. By and large, IRA units in [[Munster]] and most of [[Connacht]] were opposed to the Treaty, while those in favour predominated in the Midlands, [[Leinster]] and [[Ulster]]. The pro-Treaty volunteers formed the nucleus of the new [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]].\n\nAnti-Treaty officers called an army convention in March 1922, attended by their supporters, which reaffirmed their opposition to the Treaty. They repudiated the authority of the D\u00e1il, claiming that its members had broken their oath to defend the [[Irish Republic]], and declared their own Army Executive to be the real government of the country until the Republic was formally established. The reasons why volunteers chose pro- and anti-Treaty positions are complex. One factor was an evaluation of the military situation. Whereas Collins, [[Richard Mulcahy]] and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] felt that the IRA could not continue to fight the British successfully, anti-Treaty officers such as [[Ernie O'Malley]] and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] felt that the IRA's position was stronger than it had ever been. Another factor was the role of powerful personalities; where the leader of an IRA unit\u2014for example [[Sean McEoin]], who sided with the Treaty in [[County Longford]]\u2014took sides, often the remainder of his command joined him. The same was also true for anti-Treaty leaders such as [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]] in Cork.\n\n==Civil War: National Army and Anti-Treatyites==\n{{main|Irish Civil War}}\n[[File:Liamlynchira.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] was the first Chief of Staff of the Anti-Treaty IRA. He died during the [[Irish Civil War]].]]\n[[File:Mick Mansfield IRA.jpg|thumb|150px|Mick Mansfield, Staff Engineer, Waterford Brigade, 1922.]]\nOn the outbreak of civil war in June 1922, the government of the [[Irish Free State]] issued directives to newspapers that its Army was to be called \"The National Army\", and that its opponents were to be called \"Irregulars\" and were not to be associated with the IRA of 1919\u20131921.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/07/02/the-irish-civil-war-a-brief-overview/|title=The Irish Civil War \u2013 A brief overview|date=2012-07-02|website=The Irish Story|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> This attitude hardened as the Civil War went on, and especially after the killing of Michael Collins in an ambush in August 1922. Collins wrote to [[W. T. Cosgrave]] on 25 July 1922 that those on the anti-Treaty side were \"misguided, but practically all of them are sincere\". However, the subsequent government attitude under Cosgrave was that the anti-Treaty side were rebels against the lawful government, and were not entitled to recognition as legitimate combatants. Some of the officers of the new [[Irish Army]], led by [[Liam Tobin]], formed an association called the \"Old IRA\" to distinguish themselves from the anti-Treaty fighters. Some pro-Treaty IRA officers, such as Eoin O'Duffy, alleged that the \"Irregulars\" had not fought the British in the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]]. O'Duffy claimed that the [[County Kerry|Kerry]] IRA's sole contribution in 1919\u201321 was \"the shooting of an unfortunate soldier on the day of the truce\". In Kerry's case (which saw more [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) men killed than anywhere else outside Dublin and Tipperary),{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} this was far from true; however, some areas such as [[County Sligo]] and [[County Wexford]] did see considerably more action in the Civil War than in the War of Independence. Other IRA men such as [[Florence O'Donoghue]] formed a group called the \"neutral IRA\", which tried to reconcile the two factions.\n\nMeanwhile, the IRA in [[Northern Ireland]] maintained its links with Michael Collins; the only Northern IRA leader to join the anti-Treaty side was Belfast commander [[Joe McKelvey]]. The Northern IRA launched a renewed military offensive in May 1922, in which it was aided covertly by both the National Army and the anti-Treaty IRA.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This was interrupted by the outbreak of civil war in the new Irish Free State. Many Northern IRA men then had to flee the North in order to escape [[internment]] or worse at the hands of the Northern authorities. Over 500 of them ended up in the National Army during the civil war.\n\nThe IRA had been expanded hugely in 1922, from perhaps 15,000 men before the truce with the British in July 1921, to over 72,000 by November 1922. Veterans of the War of Independence derisively termed the new recruits \"truceileers\". These were to divide in broadly the same ratio as the veterans; however, most of them did not take part in the Civil War.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} At the beginning of the Civil War, the Free State had about 8,000 fighters, mostly pro-Treaty IRA volunteers. The anti-Treaty side could muster about 15,000 men but it could not arm them all. At the start of the war, they had just under 7,000 rifles, a few machine guns and a handful of armoured cars taken from British garrisons (who were under orders not to fire on IRA units) as they evacuated the country. The remainder of anti-Treaty IRA arms were [[shotguns]] (3,000 of which were confiscated after the Civil War) and other civilian weapons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPublic support for the Treaty settlement and the new Irish Free State was reflected in the victory of the pro-Treaty side in general elections in 1922 and 1923. Anti-Treaty forces controversially seized a number of public buildings in [[Dublin]] in April 1922, most notably the [[Four Courts]]. Eventually, after two months and under British pressure, Michael Collins decided to remove them by force. Pro-Treaty forces bombarded the building, which surrendered after two days. [[Battle of Dublin|Confused fighting]] raged for another five days, with anti-Treaty elements of the IRA's Dublin Brigade, under [[Oscar Traynor]], occupying O'Connell Street until they were dislodged by artillery fire.\n\nIn July 1922, the anti-Treaty IRA units held most of the south and west of Ireland. However the Republicans, under a new Chief of Staff, Liam Lynch, soon lost most of the territory they initially controlled. While the anti-Treaty side had a numerical advantage at the very start of the war, they were soon both outnumbered and outgunned. The Free State's National Army was quickly expanded to over 38,000 by the end of 1922 and to 55,000 men and 3,000 officers by the end of the war; one of its sources of recruits was Irish ex-servicemen from the [[British Army]]. Additionally, the British met its requests for arms, ammunition, armoured cars, artillery and aeroplanes. By August 1922, the Free State had [[Irish Free State offensive|re-taken all the major towns]] and territory held by republicans. The Free State's best troops were the [[Dublin Guard]]: a unit composed of former IRA men, mostly from the Dublin Brigade's active service unit who were to the forefront in the Free State's offensive of July\u2013August 1922. They sided with the Free State primarily out of personal loyalty to Collins.\n\nThe anti-Treaty IRA was not equipped or trained to fight conventional warfare. Despite some determined resistance to the Free State advance south of [[Limerick]] by late August, most of them had dispersed to fight a guerrilla campaign.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:FREE-STATERS-BOMBARD.gif|thumb|125px|left|Two Free State Artillery Battery's use British Guns to shell anti-Treaty soldiers.]] -->\n\nThe anti-Treaty guerrilla campaign was spasmodic and ineffective. Much of it was composed of the destruction of infrastructure such as the main railway bridge linking [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with Dublin. They also burned many public buildings and \"commandeered\" supplies by force, alienating many civilians. Furthermore, without the public support that had existed during the [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]] and facing an enemy who knew them and the countryside intimately, the anti-Treaty forces found that they could not sustain a guerrilla war such as that fought against Britain. Only in [[County Kerry]] was a relatively effective campaign fought, with the IRA units re-taking [[Kenmare]] and other towns from the Free State on several occasions. The IRA's relative popularity in this area had much to do with the brutality of the occupying Free State troops.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Other areas of guerrilla activity included [[County Cork]], western [[County Mayo]], County Wexford and several other localities.\n\nDespite the limitations of the anti-Treaty IRA's campaign, they still inflicted more fatalities on Free State troops (about 800) in the nine-month civil war than they had on British Crown forces, who lost about 600 killed in the almost three-year-long War of Independence (1919\u20131921). The disparity is no doubt due to the Free State troops' relative paucity of training and equipment compared with British forces.\n[[File:Ballyseedy monument.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to anti-Treaty insurgents executed by Free State forces at [[Ballyseedy]], County Kerry, designed by [[Yann Goulet]].]]\nThe conduct of the Civil War resulted in long-lasting bitterness on both sides. In September special emergency legislation came into effect under which military tribunals were empowered to pass death sentences. The head of the anti-Treaty forces, Liam Lynch, responded with an announcement that Free State [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and Senators who had voted for the legislation would be targeted. A number of members of the [[Oireachtas]] were attacked, TD [[Sean Hales]] was killed and the property of parliamentarians burnt. In addition IRA men around the country burned many of the stately homes of the old Protestant [[Anglo-Irish]] landed class\u2014a policy motivated by both class antagonism and nationalist resentment against a class traditionally seen as \"pro-British\". The Free State Government, for its part, officially executed 77 anti-Treaty prisoners. Government forces also carried out a number of atrocities against prisoners. This was particularly pronounced in Kerry, where the fighting was most bitter. On at least three occasions in March 1923, IRA prisoners were massacred with [[land mines]] in reprisal for the killing of Free State soldiers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Ironically, the men accused of these war crimes were mostly from the Dublin Guard, themselves IRA veterans from 1919\u201321. ''See also: [[Executions during the Irish Civil War]]''\n\nBy 1923, the defeat of the anti-Treaty IRA seemed assured. It controlled no territory and its guerrilla campaign had little public support. The civil war petered out in mid-1923 after the death in action of IRA chief-of-staff Liam Lynch. Shortly afterward, on 24 May 1923, the anti-Treaty forces received an order, issued by [[Frank Aiken]], their chief-of-staff, to \"dump arms\". \u00c9amon de Valera supported this in his speech \"Legion of the Rearguard\":<ref>''Legion of the Rearguard'' [[Proinsias Mac Aonghusa]] ''Quotations from Eamon de Valera'' {{ISBN|0-85342-684-8}} page 36; Aiken's order page 92</ref>\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Eamondv.jpg|thumb|Eamon de Valera<br>The former [[President of the Irish Republic]] sided with anti-Treatyites during the Civil War, before breaking with [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] in 1926.]] -->\nIn de Valera's words, \"''Further sacrifice of life would now be vain and continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation's right.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/moloney2000/mal31-12.htm|title=Newshound: Links to daily newspaper articles about Northern Ireland|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, thousands of republicans were already prisoners of the Free State government led by W. T. Cosgrave; many more were arrested after they dumped arms and returned to civilian life. By late 1923, over 12,000 anti-Treaty IRA men were interned. The prisoners were released over the following year, with \u00c9amon de Valera the last to leave [[Kilmainham Gaol]] in 1924.\n\nIn 1924 the IRA counted 14,500 members in total, including young men aged from 19 upwards, but with just over 5,000 weapons in its dumps. By 1926 the number of members had shrunk to 5,042. By 1930 the IRA possessed fewer than 2,000 members and only 859 rifles, indicating the decline in its military potential. The casualties of the anti-Treaty IRA in the Civil War have never been accurately counted, but are thought to have been considerably more than the 800 or so deaths suffered by the Free State Army, perhaps two or three times as numerous. Significantly however, the war had not been brought to an end by any kind of agreement between the two sides. The IRA of the post-Civil War era would never accept the Free State as a legitimate Irish government and would continue to oppose its existence.\n\n==Ideology of the post-Civil War IRA and marginalisation in the Free State==\n[[File:Moss Twomey.png|thumb|180px|right|[[Moss Twomey]] was Chief of Staff, 1926\u201336. IRA-Soviet relations began a year earlier with [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s [[OGPU]].]]\nThe period immediately following the Irish Civil War saw the IRA swing towards the political left, manifest in the election of [[Moss Twomey]] to the position of Chief of Staff. Twomey would go on to hold the position for almost a decade and became the longest-lasting Chief of Staff of this iteration of the IRA. Under his reign, he cautiously opened the IRA up to left-wing influences in order to contrast it against the emerging right-wing stance of the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government.\n\nIn the summer of 1925, the anti-treaty IRA had sent a delegation led by [[Pa Murray]] to the [[Soviet Union]] for a personal meeting with [[Joseph Stalin]], in the hopes of gaining Soviet finance and weaponry.<ref name=\"sov\">{{cite news|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-secret-ira-soviet-agreement-1925/|publisher=[[History Ireland]]|title=The secret IRA\u2013Soviet agreement, 1925|date=8 February 2015}}</ref> A secret pact was agreed, whereby the IRA would spy on the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and pass information to [[GRU|Red Army military intelligence]] in [[New York City]] and [[London]] in return for \u00a3500 a month.<ref name=\"sov\"/> The pact was originally approved by Frank Aiken, who left soon after to co-found [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] with De Valera, before being succeeded by [[Andrew Cooney (Irish republican)|Andrew Cooney]] and Moss Twomey, who kept up the secret IRA-Soviet espionage relationship until around 1930-31.<ref name=\"sov\"/>\n\nWhile Twomey was not an ideological [[Marxist-Leninist]] (although there were some communists in the IRA at this time, such as Peadar O'Donnell); he saw the arrangement as purely utilitarian and regarded the Soviets as \"shifty\" and \"out to exploit us.\"<ref name=\"sov\"/> Some republicans argued that they had lost the Civil War because they had not appealed to the social unrest in the country and had lacked any social or economic programme, which allowed communists to gain influence. Nevertheless, the IRA passed specifications of British \"submarine detection sonar and aeroplane engines for bombers, military journals and manuals, and gas masks\" to the Soviets<ref name=\"sov\"/> and the IRA's man in the U.S., \"Mr. Jones\", passed \"reports of the army\u2019s chemical weapons service, state-of-the-art gas masks, machine-gun and aeroplane engine specifications, and reports from the navy, air service and army\" to Red Army intelligence.<ref name=\"sov\"/>\n\nIn 1926, after failing to persuade Sinn F\u00e9in to participate in the political institutions of the Free State, de Valera formed a new political party, called [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], and many Sinn F\u00e9in members left to support him. De Valera would in 1932 become [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]], at the head of the first Fianna F\u00e1il government.\n\nThe IRA considered itself to be upholding the Republic that was declared in the 1916 Proclamation and held that the government of the Irish Free State was illegitimate. It maintained that it remained the army of that Republic, in direct continuity with the IRA of the War of Independence period. There were several competing organisations on the radical republican side of Irish politics during this period. In addition to the IRA, these included the hard-line elements of anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in, such as [[Mary MacSwiney]], who had not followed de Valera into constitutional politics, and the rump of the anti-Treaty members of the [[Second D\u00e1il]], still proclaiming themselves the only legitimate Irish parliament. For most of this period, the IRA's relations with Sinn F\u00e9in were poor (IRA members were even forbidden to join the party), despite the reconciliation attempt represented by the 1929 [[Comhairle na Poblachta]].\n\nThe IRA intervened in a number of strikes during this period, and IRA members campaigned against the payment of land annuities (in respect of the buying-out of landlords by the former British administration), with Peadar O'Donnell establishing the [[Anti-Tribute League]] in 1928. Many [[Communist Party of Ireland]] members were also members of the IRA at this time. Political initiatives such as [[Saor \u00c9ire]], begun in 1931, were promoted by left-wing IRA members such as [[George Gilmore]], Peadar O'Donnell and [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. IRA members also helped establish the \"Friends of Soviet Russia\", from which they later expelled Communist Party members when relations between the two organisations deteriorated.\n\nIn the years after the Civil War, many republicans viewed the Free State, with its censorship of newspapers and extensive coercive legislation, as a sham democracy, in the service of British imperialism. The IRA remained prepared to take over the country by insurrection, after which it expected to have to fight the British again. In November 1926 it seized 11 [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] barracks, shooting dead two Garda\u00ed. The Free State immediately used its [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] to intern 110 IRA men the next day. IRA men assassinated Free State minister [[Kevin O'Higgins]] in 1927 in revenge for his perceived responsibility for executions in the Civil War. A total of four Garda\u00ed were killed by the IRA in the period 1926\u20131936.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1932 Garda\u00ed shot two IRA leaders, [[George Gilmore]] and Thomas Ryan, in [[Kilrush]], [[County Clare]].<ref>[[The Times]], ''Kilrush Shooting Wednesday'' 2 November 1932</ref>\n\n===The Rise of Fianna F\u00e1il===\n[[File:CnG 1932 Posters.jpg|thumb|left|During [[1932 Irish general election|the 1932 election]] Cumann na nGaedheal attempted to use [[red scare]] tactics by linking Fianna F\u00e1il to the [[Anti-Treaty IRA|IRA]], and the IRA to Communism.]]\nWhen de Valera's Fianna F\u00e1il party won the 1932 election, the IRA expected the Free State party [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] not to respect the result and prepared for another civil war. To their surprise, Cosgrave's party peacefully gave up power and instructed the police and armed forces to obey the new government.\n\nIn the first two years of Fianna F\u00e1il government, the IRA's membership grew from a low of 1,800 to over 10,000. This can be put down to the radicalising impact of the [[Great Depression]] on the population, to which the IRA's new social radicalism (see next section) appealed. Another important factor was the formation of the [[Blueshirts]]: a quasi-[[fascist]] organisation set up by Eoin O'Duffy, originally composed of Civil war veterans of the Free State Army. The IRA and the Blueshirts both attacked political meetings and also fought street brawls against each other. While most of the fighting was conducted with fists or boots, at least one Blueshirt and one IRA man were shot dead in these clashes. IRA leaders saw in these events the beginnings of a republican revolution and the overthrow of the Free State. They were to be disappointed.\n\nInitially, de Valera's Fianna F\u00e1il government was friendly towards the IRA, legalising the organisation and freeing all their prisoners who had been interned by Cumann na nGaedhael. This afforded the IRA a quasi-legal status that meant Garda\u00ed were unwilling to act against them for fear of repercussions. On his victory tour, de Valera snubbed a Garda guard of honour in [[Skibbereen]], but saluted the IRA one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTVSz0GkwVAC&pg=PT24&lpg=PT24&dq=skibbereen+de+valera+guard+honour&source=bl&ots=X1e1B2jKf-&sig=N3hbYZh2TdlOU-LkQoNmEPs41yI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMImuDiiKLnxwIVSxUsCh23wg2f#v=onepage&q=skibbereen%20de%20valera%20guard%20honour&f=false|title=A Memoir|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref> By 1935 this relationship had turned to enmity on both sides. The IRA accused Fianna F\u00e1il of \"selling out\" by not declaring a republic and by tolerating the continued partition of Ireland. De Valera banned the IRA in 1936, after they murdered a landlord's agent, Richard More O'Farrell, in a land dispute and fired shots at police during a strike of [[Dublin tramways]] workers, on top of their bank robberies. However, most of the IRA's republican constituency were reconciled to the Free State by de Valera's government, which introduced a republican constitution in 1937, abolishing the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the British monarchy and introducing an elected president as head of state. The document also included [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|a territorial claim to Northern Ireland]]. By the late 1930s at the latest, most Irish people disagreed with the residual Irish Republican Army's claims that it remained the legitimate 'army of the Republic'.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the IRA's main role was to try to defend the Catholic community during outbreaks of sectarian rioting. For this reason [[Peadar O'Donnell]], a left-wing IRA leader who was opposed to the Catholic nationalism of many IRA members, said disparagingly that \"we don't have an IRA battalion in Belfast, we have a battalion of armed Catholics\".\n\n===The left-wing dampens===\nThis burst of what has sometimes been termed \"social republicanism\" expired in the mid-1930s. In 1931 Saor \u00c9ire had quickly collapsed due to the combination of fierce reaction from the Catholic Church, deeply hostile to anything that appeared communist, and repressive legislation immediately introduced by the government. Left-wing IRA members, including Peadar O'Donnell, Frank Ryan and George Gilmore, frustrated with the failure of the IRA to achieve either \"The Republic\" or socialist revolution, left in 1934 to set up a new party, the [[Republican Congress]]. This, in turn, was ultimately a failure, partly because conservative elements in the IRA leadership opposed it and forced its supporters to leave the organisation. The Congress itself also split and collapsed after its first general meeting in 1935.\n\n===The IRA and the Spanish Civil War===\nIn 1936\u201337, a number of ex-IRA men were among the Irish fighters (later to become known as the [[Connolly Column]]) who joined the largely socialist [[International Brigades]] to fight for the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against the Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The IRA did not show any support for the Spanish Republic and subsequently banned members for joining the Connolly Column.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ulsternation.org.uk/irish_politics_and_the_spanish.htm|title=Irish Politics and the Spanish Civil War|website=www.ulsternation.org.uk|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref> Frank Ryan was perhaps the most prominent Irish participant. (At the same time, IRA opponent and [[Greenshirts (National Corporate Party)|Greenshirts]] leader Eoin O'Duffy organised the [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|Irish Brigade]] to go to Spain to fight on the opposing side, with [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists.)\n\n===Renewed repression durings the late 1930s===\nThe IRA was banned once again in 1935, as were the Blueshirts. Moss Twomey was imprisoned and was succeeded as chief of staff by [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]]. De Valera's government increasingly followed a strict anti-IRA policy. In 1936 Vice-Admiral [[Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville|Henry Somerville]] was assassinated in his West Cork home by IRA gunmen for recruiting many local Irishmen, including IRA members and even a captain in the Drimoleague IRA company, into the British military which combined with other members immigrating to the UK for work had a notable effect on IRA manpower. The Garda\u00ed described the assassination as \"a well and coolly thought-out outrage, well-planned and daringly executed\u201d.\n\n==Sean Russell as Chief of Staff and a rightward swing==\n[[File:Sean Russell.jpg|thumb|Under Sean Russell's leadership, the IRA once again sought war with Britain]]\nFollowing the capture of several Chiefs of Staff in a row, an IRA convention was called and [[Se\u00e1n Russell]] was voted in as chief of staff in 1938. Russell's tenure as Chief of Staff signalled both a tactical and ideological departure from the Twomey and MacBride period. Russell eschewed the left-wing tendencies of the 1920s and 30s IRA and pushed for a more \"militarist\" approach.\n\n===The backing of the second D\u00e1il===\n{{main|Irish republican legitimism}}  \nOne of the first major moves by Russell was to shore up the political credibility of the IRA. As Chief of Staff, he was able to secure a powerful symbolic gesture from the \"rump\" of the second D\u00e1il, that is to say, elected members of the [[Second D\u00e1il]] who remained Republicans. 7 of these former TDs transferred what authority they believed they had as representatives of the second D\u00e1il to the IRA army council, thus, in their minds, rendering it the legitimate governing body of Ireland. The IRA felt this move gave them the authority to formally declare war on the [[United Kingdom]], which they would almost immediately do.\n\n===Ideological shift===\nThe IRA that emerged from the debacle of the Republican Congress would be inspired primarily by a conservative, strictly nationalist political outlook and was increasingly influenced by radical right-wing ideas based on [[Catholic social teaching]] such as [[corporatism]], [[distributism]] and even the fascist ideology of [[Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe]] which sent books, journals and posters to IRA internees imprisoned in the [[Curragh Camp|Curragh]]. Tarlach \u00d3 hUid, the editor of the IRA newspaper ''War News'', and Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Broin, a member of the IRA Army Council, became members of Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe, and the IRA Adjutant-General, [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Dubhghaill]], expressed his approval of the party in a letter to its leader [[Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Cuinneag\u00e1in]].<ref>[https://books.google.ie/books?id=0NTJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The IRA 1956\u201369: Rethinking the Republic''], Matt Treacey, page 35</ref><ref>''Architects of the Resurrection: Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe and the fascist 'New Order' in Ireland'', R.M Douglas, page 168</ref>\n\n[[Antisemitic]] sentiments also began to be expressed including satisfaction at the 'cleansing fires' of the [[Wehrmacht]] driving the Jews out of Europe and accusations towards the Irish government of being dominated by \"Jews and freemasons\".<ref>[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/oh-heres-to-adolph-hitler-the-ira-and-the-nazis/ \u2018Oh here\u2019s to Adolph Hitler\u2019?

A year later IRA officers approached O'Duffy and asked him to join the organisation. While O'Duffy did not take up the offer, he was later invited to join Moss Twomey and Andrew Cooney in protesting the basing of American troops in Northern Ireland.<ref>''Eoin O'Duffy: A Self-Made Hero'', Fearghal McGarry, page 338</ref>\n\nIn 1940, prominent members and supporters of the IRA established [[C\u00f3ras na Poblachta]], which among its objectives called for the \"destruction of the Masonic Order in Ireland\" and the \"reversal of the cultural conquest of our country by England\", not excluding \"the employment of compulsion\" to that end.<ref>Douglas, page 78</ref> Many far-right figures joined the party including \u00d3 Cuinneag\u00e1in, who lead the party's youth wing, Aic\u00e9in, until its independence was terminated in 1942, and C\u00f3ras na Poblachta took on a strongly anti-semitic and pro-German character.<ref>Douglas, page 79-80</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|WW2}}<!-- [[IRA in World War II]] redirects here -->World War II: The IRA, The Emergency, links to Nazi Germany==\n{{main|IRA Abwehr World War II|S-Plan|Northern Campaign (IRA)|The Emergency (Ireland)}}\n[[File:IRA.Coventry.attack.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[1939 Coventry bombing]]]]\n[[File:James O'Donovan.png|thumb|180px|right|[[Seamus O'Donovan]] was a key figure in organising the [[S-Plan]] in 1939-40.

The so-called \"S-Plan\" saw IRA operatives based in Britain bombing British infrastructure, with a view to weakening their war effort.\n\nOn 23 December 1939, IRA members stole almost the entire reserve ammunition store of the Irish Army from the [[Magazine Fort]] in Dublin's [[Phoenix Park]]. This became known as the \"[[Christmas Raid]]\" in IRA folklore. The [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) found two and a half tons of the stolen ammunition inside [[County Armagh]] on 2 January 1940. The next day the Irish Minister for Justice, [[Gerald Boland]], at an emergency session of the D\u00e1il, introduced the Emergency Powers Bill to reinstate internment, Military Tribunal, and executions for IRA members. It was rushed through and given its third reading the next day creating the Emergency Powers Act. It was later used to execute at least six IRA volunteers in Ireland between 1940 and 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/19125|title=Remembering the Past: Executed IRA men reinterred {{!}} An Phoblacht|website=www.anphoblacht.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref> Peter Barnes and James McCormack who had been arrested in England shortly following an IRA bomb that exploded in Coventry on 25 August 1939 resulting in the deaths of several uninvolved English civilians, were executed on 7 February 1940. Republican publication An Phoblacht did not deny their mission in England and IRA membership but maintains that they were not involved with the Coventry bombing.\n\nBy 1941, the IRA numbered fewer than 1,000 members, many of whom were imprisoned. Most of its able political organisers had left in the mid- to late-1930s and its \"natural constituency\" had been appropriated by Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the IRA hoped for support from Germany to strike against Britain. [[Se\u00e1n Russell]] travelled to Germany in 1940 to canvass for arms. He became ill and died on board a German U-boat which was bringing him back to Ireland in August that year along with Frank Ryan (see [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]]). [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]], the acting Chief of Staff, prepared an invasion plan for Northern Ireland and sent it to German Intelligence in 1940; this plan was later called [[Plan Kathleen]], but it was discovered by the Irish authorities within one month of its creation. The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] opposed the IRA's collaboration with Nazi Germany, having adopted a position of neutrality.\n\nGunther Schuetz, a member of the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence), parachuted into Ireland and was almost immediately arrested. On 28 February 1942 he escaped. The IRA intended to send him back to Germany with a request for weapons, ammunition, explosives, radio equipment and money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.markhumphrys.com/sfira.nazis.html|title=The IRA supported the Nazis in WW2|website=www.markhumphrys.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> The IRA Army Executive met on 20 April and sanctioned the request. They also approved a plan to \"give military information to powers at war with England even before any definite contacts [were] established with these powers\", provided the information did not endanger civilians.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/secretarmyira00bell |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/secretarmyira00bell/page/224 224] |quote=to give military information to powers at war with England, which would not endanger civilian lives, even before any definite contacts have been established with these powers. |title=The Secret Army: The IRA |publisher=Transaction Publishers |author=J.

The boat was seized and the crew arrested.<ref>[[J Bowyer Bell]] \u2013 ''The Secret Army'', pages 262\u2013264; also Enno Stephan ''Spies in Ireland'' ({{ISBN|1-131-82692-2}} (reprint)), pages 226, 245 and 275</ref>\n\nIn Belfast, much to the alarm of the Northern Ireland authorities, the city's brigade had developed a \"Protestant squad\", an intelligence unit, largely recruited by [[John Graham (Irish republican)|John Graham]], a [[Church of Ireland]] devout, from [[Denis Ireland]]'s Ulster Union Club.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The IRA|last=Coogan|first=Tim Pat|publisher=Macmillan|year=2002|location=London|page=178}}.</ref> But while Graham, who opposed cooperation with the Germans, and others in the Belfast command continued to debate the merits of a new [[Northern campaign (Irish Republican Army)|northern campaign]], in April 1942 a diversionary action, intended to draw the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from an illegal [[Easter Rising|1916]] commemoration, developed into a street gun battle.

However, information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of raids such as the [[Belfast Blitz]] was based exclusively on the aerial reconnaissance of the [[Luftwaffe]].\n\nThe IRA was severely damaged by the measures taken against it by the governments on both sides of the border during the Second World War. IRA members were interned both north and south of the border, and a number of IRA men, including the chief of staff between 1942 and 1944, [[Charlie Kerins]], were executed by the Irish government for criminal offences committed during the war. Kerins had been tried and found guilty of the murder of a local police officer ([[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]]).\n\n==The Post-World War II IRA==\nFollowing [[World War II]], the IRA still existed but its numbers had been severely depleted. Some IRA units remained in the Irish countryside; however, they were cut off from any sort of command structure and bitterly demoralised. Out of touch with [[Dublin]], and with other units, IRA members became fewer and fewer. In 1945, one of the first attempts was made to create a centre in Dublin. The meeting consisted of Sean Ashe, Micksy Conway, [[Tony Magan]], Willie McGuinness, Bertie McCormack and a few others. They did not know who else would help, nor who had been in the Army. The problems were evident but no one had ready answers. The loss of all the GHQ staff and their records had left Dublin as isolated from the country as the country was from Dublin. Even though there was a lack of information and manpower, the obvious first step was to get some sort of unit going in Dublin. The next step was to resurrect the Army Executive and through it, the legitimate structure of the IRA.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Secret Army: The IRA|last=Bell|first=J.

Several of the leading members were also former left-wing IRA members and the party itself espoused itself as Republican. However, many of the militarists left within the IRA were not eager to support any political party which recognised the legitimacy of D\u00e1il Eireann, and indeed, the IRA banned its members from joining the Clann on the basis of they were not going to be an abstentionist party.<ref name=\"A Short History\"/> Nonetheless, they watched with curiosity as to how this party would fare. At first hopes for Clann na Poblachta were high, with some believing it would challenge Fianna F\u00e1il in the D\u00e1il. However shrewd electioneering by De Valera meant that the Clann did not become the great power they had hoped to be. They did, however, manage to enter government in 1948 as part of the coalition which made up the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]]. Unfortunately for the Clann, that government's run proved to be somewhat disastrous and permanently dented their support. In each subsequent election, the Clann received less and less support until it dissolved as a party in 1965.\n\nThe failure of Clann na Poblachta reinforced the IRA's doubts about the ability of left-wing political parties to wrestle power out of the hands of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael and helped spur the IRA towards traditionalism in the 1950s. However, their initial success did help convince the IRA they would have to marry their military tactics with political tactics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bell |first=J.

The \"three Macs\" believed that a political organisation was necessary to help rebuild the IRA. IRA members were instructed to join Sinn F\u00e9in en masse, and despite the IRA's small numbers following WW2, they were successfully able to fully take over the organisation. This coup d'\u00e9tat of Sinn F\u00e9in was made possible due to the weak state of Sinn F\u00e9in itself; the party had become a shell of its former self in the decades following Eamon De Valera taking the bulk of the membership with him when he split to form Fianna Fail in 1926. Paddy McLogan was named Sinn F\u00e9in president in 1950, with fellow IRA member [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Dubhghaill]] named Vice-President, signalling the IRA's complete control of the party's apparatus.<ref name=\"A Short History\"/><ref name=\"Inside the IRA\">{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Andrew |date=2011 |title=Inside the IRA: Dissident Republicans and the War for Legitimacy |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=PcdvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT16&dq=IRA+1950&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjovI_Y8pfmAhXLVBUIHfeiDR4Q6AEINzAC#v=onepage&q=sinn%20f%C3%A9in&f=false |location= |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page= |isbn=0748641122 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n===Ideology of the post-World War II IRA===\nUnder the new IRA leadership, Sinn F\u00e9in began to advocate a corporatist social policy inspired by the Papal Encyclicals of [[Pope Pius XI]], with the aim of creating a Catholic state, and opposed [[parliamentary democracy]], advocating its replacement with a form of government akin to [[Portugal]]'s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], but rejected fascism as they considered a fascist state to be too secular and centralized.<ref>''Irish republicanism and socialism: the politics of the republican movement, 1905 to 1994'', Pat Walsh, {{ISBN|9780850340716}}, p. 41 & 42</ref>\n\n==The Border campaign==\n{{main|Border Campaign (IRA)}}\nBeginning in the 1950s the IRA started planning for a renewed armed campaign, and in 1956 recent recruit [[Se\u00e1n Cronin]], who had considerable military experience, drew up a plan codenamed Operation Harvest.\n\nThe [[Border Campaign (IRA)|border campaign]], as it became known, involved various military columns carrying out a range of military operations, from direct attacks on security installations to disruptive actions against infrastructure. The campaign received, initially, significant support from the south. Support increased massively after the deaths of [[Se\u00e1n South]] and [[Fergal O'Hanlon]] in the [[Brookeborough|Brookeborough Raid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bordertours.ie/brookeborough-raid/|title=Brookeborough Raid \u00ab  Border Tours|website=www.bordertours.ie|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> In the [[1957 Irish general election|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann election]]s held in 1957, Sinn F\u00e9in fielded 19 candidates and won four seats, and almost won a couple more in tightly contested elections. One of the four new Sinn F\u00e9in TDs would be future IRA Chief of Staff [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]].\n\nHowever, internment without trial, introduced first in Northern Ireland and then in the [[Republic of Ireland]], curtailed IRA operations and ultimately broke morale. Eighteen people in total were killed during the campaign, of whom seven were members of the RUC and eight were members of the IRA itself. The campaign was on the whole a failure. It petered out in the late 1950s and was officially ended in February 1962.\n\n==1960s: Marxist tendency and the 1969 split==\nIn the 1960s the IRA once more came under the influence of left-wing thinkers, especially those such as [[C. Desmond Greaves]] and [[Roy Johnston]] active in the [[Connolly Association]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://terrorism.about.com/od/groupsleader1/p/IRA.htm|title=What is the Irish Republican Army and What do They Stand For?|newspaper=About.com News & Issues|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> In parallel, the position of Chief of Staff became dominated by three left-wing members: Sean Cronin, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and [[Cathal Goulding]].\n\nFollowing the failure of the border campaign, the IRA and its allies undertook a serious review of themselves. By 1962 there were two factions in the Republican movement; the \"Curragh\" faction consisting of older IRA men who had served prison sentences together in the Curragh who favoured traditionalism and now controlled Sinn F\u00e9in such as Paddy McLogan, and a faction of younger, left-wing IRA members such as Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and Cathal Goulding who now controlled the IRA Army Council following post-Border campaign elections. The Curragh faction wanted to publicly declare that Sinn F\u00e9in had no part in calling off the Border campaign. They were told in stark terms they were to do no such thing, as, besides the fact this would undermine the IRA's decision to end the campaign, Sinn F\u00e9in would never have had any influence in the decision regardless, as only the IRA Army Council had the authority to begin or end campaigns. Furthermore, it was made clear by the IRA that, as far as they were concerned, Sinn F\u00e9in answered to the IRA, and not the other way around.

Following the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] on 6 December 1921, the IRA in the 26 counties that were to become the [[Irish Free State]] split between supporters and opponents of the Treaty. The '''anti-Treatyites''', sometimes referred to by [[Free Stater (Ireland)|Free State forces]] as '''Irregulars''',{{Ref|NoteA|A}} continued to use the name '''Irish Republican Army''' ('''IRA''') or in [[Irish language|Irish]] '''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''', as did the organisation in [[Northern Ireland]] which originally supported the pro-Treaty side (if not the Treaty).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/sectarian-violence-and-murder-spreads-across-the-north-199309.html|title=Sectarian violence and murder spreads across the North|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/michael-collins-and-anti-treaty-side-did-deal-to-encourage-trouble-in-north-1.1949924|title=Michael Collins and anti-Treaty side did deal to encourage trouble in North|date=3 October 2014|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref> ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' was also adopted as the name of the pro-Treaty [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]], and remains the official legal title of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Irish Defence Forces]].<ref>''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann'' is the legal name of the Irish Defence Force - Section 3, Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923. also Section 16, Defence Act 1954.</ref> This article deals with the anti-Treaty IRA that fought against the Irish Free State in the [[Irish Civil War]], and with its successors up to 1969, when the IRA split again.\n\n==The \"Old IRA\" split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty==\n{{See also|IRA and the Anglo-Irish Treaty}}\n\nThe signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty by the Irish delegation in London caused an angry reaction among the less compromising elements in [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and among a majority of the IRA. [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (1919-1922)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] ratified the Treaty by 64 votes to 57 after a lengthy and acrimonious debate, following which President [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] resigned. Sinn F\u00e9in split between pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty factions, and the Army did likewise. The majority of headquarters staff, many of whom were close to [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], supported the Treaty, but opinion among IRA volunteers was divided. By and large, IRA units in [[Munster]] and most of [[Connacht]] were opposed to the Treaty, while those in favour predominated in the Midlands, [[Leinster]] and [[Ulster]]. The pro-Treaty volunteers formed the nucleus of the new [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]].\n\nAnti-Treaty officers called an army convention in March 1922, attended by their supporters, which reaffirmed their opposition to the Treaty. They repudiated the authority of the D\u00e1il, claiming that its members had broken their oath to defend the [[Irish Republic]], and declared their own Army Executive to be the real government of the country until the Republic was formally established. The reasons why volunteers chose pro- and anti-Treaty positions are complex. One factor was an evaluation of the military situation. Whereas Collins, [[Richard Mulcahy]] and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] felt that the IRA could not continue to fight the British successfully, anti-Treaty officers such as [[Ernie O'Malley]] and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] felt that the IRA's position was stronger than it had ever been. Another factor was the role of powerful personalities; where the leader of an IRA unit\u2014for example [[Sean McEoin]], who sided with the Treaty in [[County Longford]]\u2014took sides, often the remainder of his command joined him. The same was also true for anti-Treaty leaders such as [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]] in Cork.\n\n==Civil War: National Army and Anti-Treatyites==\n{{main|Irish Civil War}}\n[[File:Liamlynchira.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] was the first Chief of Staff of the Anti-Treaty IRA. He died during the [[Irish Civil War]].]]\n[[File:Mick Mansfield IRA.jpg|thumb|150px|Mick Mansfield, Staff Engineer, Waterford Brigade, 1922.]]\nOn the outbreak of civil war in June 1922, the government of the [[Irish Free State]] issued directives to newspapers that its Army was to be called \"The National Army\", and that its opponents were to be called \"Irregulars\" and were not to be associated with the IRA of 1919\u20131921.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/07/02/the-irish-civil-war-a-brief-overview/|title=The Irish Civil War \u2013 A brief overview|date=2012-07-02|website=The Irish Story|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> This attitude hardened as the Civil War went on, and especially after the killing of Michael Collins in an ambush in August 1922. Collins wrote to [[W. T. Cosgrave]] on 25 July 1922 that those on the anti-Treaty side were \"misguided, but practically all of them are sincere\". However, the subsequent government attitude under Cosgrave was that the anti-Treaty side were rebels against the lawful government, and were not entitled to recognition as legitimate combatants. Some of the officers of the new [[Irish Army]], led by [[Liam Tobin]], formed an association called the \"Old IRA\" to distinguish themselves from the anti-Treaty fighters. Some pro-Treaty IRA officers, such as Eoin O'Duffy, alleged that the \"Irregulars\" had not fought the British in the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]]. O'Duffy claimed that the [[County Kerry|Kerry]] IRA's sole contribution in 1919\u201321 was \"the shooting of an unfortunate soldier on the day of the truce\". In Kerry's case (which saw more [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) men killed than anywhere else outside Dublin and Tipperary),{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} this was far from true; however, some areas such as [[County Sligo]] and [[County Wexford]] did see considerably more action in the Civil War than in the War of Independence. Other IRA men such as [[Florence O'Donoghue]] formed a group called the \"neutral IRA\", which tried to reconcile the two factions.\n\nMeanwhile, the IRA in [[Northern Ireland]] maintained its links with Michael Collins; the only Northern IRA leader to join the anti-Treaty side was Belfast commander [[Joe McKelvey]]. The Northern IRA launched a renewed military offensive in May 1922, in which it was aided covertly by both the National Army and the anti-Treaty IRA.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This was interrupted by the outbreak of civil war in the new Irish Free State. Many Northern IRA men then had to flee the North in order to escape [[internment]] or worse at the hands of the Northern authorities. Over 500 of them ended up in the National Army during the civil war.\n\nThe IRA had been expanded hugely in 1922, from perhaps 15,000 men before the truce with the British in July 1921, to over 72,000 by November 1922. Veterans of the War of Independence derisively termed the new recruits \"truceileers\". These were to divide in broadly the same ratio as the veterans; however, most of them did not take part in the Civil War.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} At the beginning of the Civil War, the Free State had about 8,000 fighters, mostly pro-Treaty IRA volunteers. The anti-Treaty side could muster about 15,000 men but it could not arm them all. At the start of the war, they had just under 7,000 rifles, a few machine guns and a handful of armoured cars taken from British garrisons (who were under orders not to fire on IRA units) as they evacuated the country. The remainder of anti-Treaty IRA arms were [[shotguns]] (3,000 of which were confiscated after the Civil War) and other civilian weapons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPublic support for the Treaty settlement and the new Irish Free State was reflected in the victory of the pro-Treaty side in general elections in 1922 and 1923. Anti-Treaty forces controversially seized a number of public buildings in [[Dublin]] in April 1922, most notably the [[Four Courts]]. Eventually, after two months and under British pressure, Michael Collins decided to remove them by force. Pro-Treaty forces bombarded the building, which surrendered after two days. [[Battle of Dublin|Confused fighting]] raged for another five days, with anti-Treaty elements of the IRA's Dublin Brigade, under [[Oscar Traynor]], occupying O'Connell Street until they were dislodged by artillery fire.\n\nIn July 1922, the anti-Treaty IRA units held most of the south and west of Ireland. However the Republicans, under a new Chief of Staff, Liam Lynch, soon lost most of the territory they initially controlled. While the anti-Treaty side had a numerical advantage at the very start of the war, they were soon both outnumbered and outgunned. The Free State's National Army was quickly expanded to over 38,000 by the end of 1922 and to 55,000 men and 3,000 officers by the end of the war; one of its sources of recruits was Irish ex-servicemen from the [[British Army]]. Additionally, the British met its requests for arms, ammunition, armoured cars, artillery and aeroplanes. By August 1922, the Free State had [[Irish Free State offensive|re-taken all the major towns]] and territory held by republicans. The Free State's best troops were the [[Dublin Guard]]: a unit composed of former IRA men, mostly from the Dublin Brigade's active service unit who were to the forefront in the Free State's offensive of July\u2013August 1922. They sided with the Free State primarily out of personal loyalty to Collins.\n\nThe anti-Treaty IRA was not equipped or trained to fight conventional warfare. Despite some determined resistance to the Free State advance south of [[Limerick]] by late August, most of them had dispersed to fight a guerrilla campaign.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:FREE-STATERS-BOMBARD.gif|thumb|125px|left|Two Free State Artillery Battery's use British Guns to shell anti-Treaty soldiers.]] -->\n\nThe anti-Treaty guerrilla campaign was spasmodic and ineffective. Much of it was composed of the destruction of infrastructure such as the main railway bridge linking [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with Dublin. They also burned many public buildings and \"commandeered\" supplies by force, alienating many civilians. Furthermore, without the public support that had existed during the [[Anglo-Irish War|War of Independence]] and facing an enemy who knew them and the countryside intimately, the anti-Treaty forces found that they could not sustain a guerrilla war such as that fought against Britain. Only in [[County Kerry]] was a relatively effective campaign fought, with the IRA units re-taking [[Kenmare]] and other towns from the Free State on several occasions. The IRA's relative popularity in this area had much to do with the brutality of the occupying Free State troops.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Other areas of guerrilla activity included [[County Cork]], western [[County Mayo]], County Wexford and several other localities.\n\nDespite the limitations of the anti-Treaty IRA's campaign, they still inflicted more fatalities on Free State troops (about 800) in the nine-month civil war than they had on British Crown forces, who lost about 600 killed in the almost three-year-long War of Independence (1919\u20131921). The disparity is no doubt due to the Free State troops' relative paucity of training and equipment compared with British forces.\n[[File:Ballyseedy monument.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to anti-Treaty insurgents executed by Free State forces at [[Ballyseedy]], County Kerry, designed by [[Yann Goulet]].]]\nThe conduct of the Civil War resulted in long-lasting bitterness on both sides. In September special emergency legislation came into effect under which military tribunals were empowered to pass death sentences. The head of the anti-Treaty forces, Liam Lynch, responded with an announcement that Free State [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s and Senators who had voted for the legislation would be targeted. A number of members of the [[Oireachtas]] were attacked, TD [[Sean Hales]] was killed and the property of parliamentarians burnt. In addition IRA men around the country burned many of the stately homes of the old Protestant [[Anglo-Irish]] landed class\u2014a policy motivated by both class antagonism and nationalist resentment against a class traditionally seen as \"pro-British\". The Free State Government, for its part, officially executed 77 anti-Treaty prisoners. Government forces also carried out a number of atrocities against prisoners. This was particularly pronounced in Kerry, where the fighting was most bitter. On at least three occasions in March 1923, IRA prisoners were massacred with [[land mines]] in reprisal for the killing of Free State soldiers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Ironically, the men accused of these war crimes were mostly from the Dublin Guard, themselves IRA veterans from 1919\u201321. ''See also: [[Executions during the Irish Civil War]]''\n\nBy 1923, the defeat of the anti-Treaty IRA seemed assured. It controlled no territory and its guerrilla campaign had little public support. The civil war petered out in mid-1923 after the death in action of IRA chief-of-staff Liam Lynch. Shortly afterward, on 24 May 1923, the anti-Treaty forces received an order, issued by [[Frank Aiken]], their chief-of-staff, to \"dump arms\". \u00c9amon de Valera supported this in his speech \"Legion of the Rearguard\":<ref>''Legion of the Rearguard'' [[Proinsias Mac Aonghusa]] ''Quotations from Eamon de Valera'' {{ISBN|0-85342-684-8}} page 36; Aiken's order page 92</ref>\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Eamondv.jpg|thumb|Eamon de Valera<br>The former [[President of the Irish Republic]] sided with anti-Treatyites during the Civil War, before breaking with [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] in 1926.]] -->\nIn de Valera's words, \"''Further sacrifice of life would now be vain and continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the Republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation's right.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/moloney2000/mal31-12.htm|title=Newshound: Links to daily newspaper articles about Northern Ireland|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy this time, thousands of republicans were already prisoners of the Free State government led by W. T. Cosgrave; many more were arrested after they dumped arms and returned to civilian life. By late 1923, over 12,000 anti-Treaty IRA men were interned. The prisoners were released over the following year, with \u00c9amon de Valera the last to leave [[Kilmainham Gaol]] in 1924.\n\nIn 1924 the IRA counted 14,500 members in total, including young men aged from 19 upwards, but with just over 5,000 weapons in its dumps. By 1926 the number of members had shrunk to 5,042. By 1930 the IRA possessed fewer than 2,000 members and only 859 rifles, indicating the decline in its military potential. The casualties of the anti-Treaty IRA in the Civil War have never been accurately counted, but are thought to have been considerably more than the 800 or so deaths suffered by the Free State Army, perhaps two or three times as numerous. Significantly however, the war had not been brought to an end by any kind of agreement between the two sides. The IRA of the post-Civil War era would never accept the Free State as a legitimate Irish government and would continue to oppose its existence.\n\n==Ideology of the post-Civil War IRA and marginalisation in the Free State==\n[[File:Moss Twomey.png|thumb|180px|right|[[Moss Twomey]] was Chief of Staff, 1926\u201336. IRA-Soviet relations began a year earlier with [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]'s [[OGPU]].]]\nThe period immediately following the Irish Civil War saw the IRA swing towards the political left, manifest in the election of [[Moss Twomey]] to the position of Chief of Staff. Twomey would go on to hold the position for almost decade and became the longest-lasting Chief of Staff of this iteration of the IRA. Under his reign, he cautiously opened the IRA up to left-wing influences in order to contrast it against the emerging right-wing stance of the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government.\n\nIn the summer of 1925, the anti-treaty IRA had sent a delegation led by [[Pa Murray]] to the [[Soviet Union]] for a personal meeting with [[Joseph Stalin]], in the hopes of gaining Soviet finance and weaponry.<ref name=\"sov\">{{cite news|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-secret-ira-soviet-agreement-1925/|publisher=[[History Ireland]]|title=The secret IRA\u2013Soviet agreement, 1925|date=8 February 2015}}</ref> A secret pact was agreed, whereby the IRA would spy on the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and pass information to [[GRU|Red Army military intelligence]] in [[New York City]] and [[London]] in return for \u00a3500 a month.<ref name=\"sov\"/> The pact was originally approved by Frank Aiken, who left soon after to co-found [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] with De Valera, before being succeeded by [[Andrew Cooney (Irish republican)|Andrew Cooney]] and Moss Twomey, who kept up the secret IRA-Soviet espionage relationship until around 1930-31.<ref name=\"sov\"/>\n\nWhile Twomey was not an ideological [[Marxist-Leninist]] (although there were some communists in the IRA at this time, such as Peadar O'Donnell); he saw the arrangement as purely utilitarian and regarded the Soviets as \"shifty\" and \"out to exploit us.\"<ref name=\"sov\"/> Some republicans argued that they had lost the Civil War because they had not appealed to the social unrest in the country and had lacked any social or economic programme, which allowed communists to gain influence. Nevertheless, the IRA passed specifications of British \"submarine detection sonar and aeroplane engines for bombers, military journals and manuals, and gas masks\" to the Soviets<ref name=\"sov\"/> and the IRA's man in the U.S., \"Mr. Jones\", passed \"reports of the army\u2019s chemical weapons service, state-of-the-art gas masks, machine-gun and aeroplane engine specifications, and reports from the navy, air service and army\" to Red Army intelligence.<ref name=\"sov\"/>\n\nIn 1926, after failing to persuade Sinn F\u00e9in to participate in the political institutions of the Free State, de Valera formed a new political party, called [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], and many Sinn F\u00e9in members left to support him. De Valera would in 1932 become [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]], at the head of the first Fianna F\u00e1il government.\n\nThe IRA considered itself to be upholding the Republic that was declared in the 1916 Proclamation and held that the government of the Irish Free State was illegitimate. It maintained that it remained the army of that Republic, in direct continuity with the IRA of the War of Independence period. There were several competing organisations on the radical republican side of Irish politics during this period. In addition to the IRA, these included the hard-line elements of anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in, such as [[Mary MacSwiney]], who had not followed de Valera into constitutional politics, and the rump of the anti-Treaty members of the [[Second D\u00e1il]], still proclaiming themselves the only legitimate Irish parliament. For most of this period, the IRA's relations with Sinn F\u00e9in were poor (IRA members were even forbidden to join the party), despite the reconciliation attempt represented by the 1929 [[Comhairle na Poblachta]].\n\nThe IRA intervened in a number of strikes during this period, and IRA members campaigned against the payment of land annuities (in respect of the buying-out of landlords by the former British administration), with Peadar O'Donnell establishing the [[Anti-Tribute League]] in 1928. Many [[Communist Party of Ireland]] members were also members of the IRA at this time. Political initiatives such as [[Saor \u00c9ire]], begun in 1931, were promoted by left-wing IRA members such as [[George Gilmore]], Peadar O'Donnell and [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. IRA members also helped establish the \"Friends of Soviet Russia\", from which they later expelled Communist Party members when relations between the two organisations deteriorated.\n\nIn the years after the Civil War, many republicans viewed the Free State, with its censorship of newspapers and extensive coercive legislation, as a sham democracy, in the service of British imperialism. The IRA remained prepared to take over the country by insurrection, after which it expected to have to fight the British again. In November 1926 it seized 11 [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] barracks, shooting dead two Garda\u00ed. The Free State immediately used its [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] to intern 110 IRA men the next day. IRA men assassinated Free State minister [[Kevin O'Higgins]] in 1927 in revenge for his perceived responsibility for executions in the Civil War. A total of four Garda\u00ed were killed by the IRA in the period 1926\u20131936.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1932 Garda\u00ed shot two IRA leaders, [[George Gilmore]] and Thomas Ryan, in [[Kilrush]], [[County Clare]].<ref>[[The Times]], ''Kilrush Shooting Wednesday'' 2 November 1932</ref>\n\n===The Rise of Fianna F\u00e1il===\n[[File:CnG 1932 Posters.jpg|thumb|left|During [[1932 Irish general election|the 1932 election]] Cumann na nGaedheal attempted to use [[red scare]] tactics by linking Fianna F\u00e1il to the [[Anti-Treaty IRA|IRA]], and the IRA to Communism.]]\nWhen de Valera's Fianna F\u00e1il party won the 1932 election, the IRA expected the Free State party [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] not to respect the result and prepared for another civil war. To their surprise, Cosgrave's party peacefully gave up power and instructed the police and armed forces to obey the new government.\n\nIn the first two years of Fianna F\u00e1il government, the IRA's membership grew from a low of 1,800 to over 10,000. This can be put down to the radicalising impact of the [[Great Depression]] on the population, to which the IRA's new social radicalism (see next section) appealed. Another important factor was the formation of the [[Blueshirts]]: a quasi-[[fascist]] organisation set up by Eoin O'Duffy, originally composed of Civil war veterans of the Free State Army. The IRA and the Blueshirts both attacked political meetings and also fought street brawls against each other. While most of the fighting was conducted with fists or boots, at least one Blueshirt and one IRA man were shot dead in these clashes. IRA leaders saw in these events the beginnings of a republican revolution and the overthrow of the Free State. They were to be disappointed.\n\nInitially, de Valera's Fianna F\u00e1il government was friendly towards the IRA, legalising the organisation and freeing all their prisoners who had been interned by Cumann na nGaedhael. This afforded the IRA a quasi-legal status that meant Garda\u00ed were unwilling to act against them for fear of repercussions. On his victory tour, de Valera snubbed a Garda guard of honour in [[Skibbereen]], but saluted the IRA one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTVSz0GkwVAC&pg=PT24&lpg=PT24&dq=skibbereen+de+valera+guard+honour&source=bl&ots=X1e1B2jKf-&sig=N3hbYZh2TdlOU-LkQoNmEPs41yI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMImuDiiKLnxwIVSxUsCh23wg2f#v=onepage&q=skibbereen%20de%20valera%20guard%20honour&f=false|title=A Memoir|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2016}}</ref> By 1935 this relationship had turned to enmity on both sides. The IRA accused Fianna F\u00e1il of \"selling out\" by not declaring a republic and by tolerating the continued partition of Ireland. De Valera banned the IRA in 1936, after they murdered a landlord's agent, Richard More O'Farrell, in a land dispute and fired shots at police during a strike of [[Dublin tramways]] workers, on top of their bank robberies. However, most of the IRA's republican constituency were reconciled to the Free State by de Valera's government, which introduced a republican constitution in 1937, abolishing the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the British monarchy and introducing an elected president as head of state. The document also included [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|a territorial claim to Northern Ireland]]. By the late 1930s at the latest, most Irish people disagreed with the residual Irish Republican Army's claims that it remained the legitimate 'army of the Republic'.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the IRA's main role was to try to defend the Catholic community during outbreaks of sectarian rioting. For this reason [[Peadar O'Donnell]], a left-wing IRA leader who was opposed to the Catholic nationalism of many IRA members, said disparagingly that \"we don't have an IRA battalion in Belfast, we have a battalion of armed Catholics\".\n\n===The left-wing dampens===\nThis burst of what has sometimes been termed \"social republicanism\" expired in the mid-1930s. In 1931 Saor \u00c9ire had quickly collapsed due to the combination of fierce reaction from the Catholic Church, deeply hostile to anything that appeared communist, and repressive legislation immediately introduced by the government. Left-wing IRA members, including Peadar O'Donnell, Frank Ryan and George Gilmore, frustrated with the failure of the IRA to achieve either \"The Republic\" or socialist revolution, left in 1934 to set up a new party, the [[Republican Congress]]. This, in turn, was ultimately a failure, partly because conservative elements in the IRA leadership opposed it and forced its supporters to leave the organisation. The Congress itself also split and collapsed after its first general meeting in 1935.\n\n===The IRA and the Spanish Civil War===\nIn 1936\u201337, a number of ex-IRA men were among the Irish fighters (later to become known as the [[Connolly Column]]) who joined the largely socialist [[International Brigades]] to fight for the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against the Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The IRA did not show any support for the Spanish Republic and subsequently banned members for joining the Connolly Column.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ulsternation.org.uk/irish_politics_and_the_spanish.htm|title=Irish Politics and the Spanish Civil War|website=www.ulsternation.org.uk|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref> Frank Ryan was perhaps the most prominent Irish participant. (At the same time, IRA opponent and [[Greenshirts (National Corporate Party)|Greenshirts]] leader Eoin O'Duffy organised the [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|Irish Brigade]] to go to Spain to fight on the opposing side, with [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists.)\n\n===Renewed repression durings the late 1930s===\nThe IRA was banned once again in 1935, as were the Blueshirts. Moss Twomey was imprisoned and was succeeded as chief of staff by [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]]. De Valera's government increasingly followed a strict anti-IRA policy. In 1936 Vice-Admiral [[Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville|Henry Somerville]] was assassinated in his West Cork home by IRA gunmen for recruiting many local Irishmen, including IRA members and even a captain in the Drimoleague IRA company, into the British military which combined with other members immigrating to the UK for work had a notable effect on IRA manpower. The Garda\u00ed described the assassination as \"a well and coolly thought-out outrage, well-planned and daringly executed\u201d.\n\n==Sean Russell as Chief of Staff and a rightward swing==\n[[File:Sean Russell.jpg|thumb|Under Sean Russell's leadership, the IRA once again sought war with Britain]]\nFollowing the capture of several Chiefs of Staff in a row, an IRA convention was called and [[Se\u00e1n Russell]] was voted in as chief of staff in 1938. Russell's tenure as Chief of Staff signalled both a tactical and ideological departure from the Twomey and MacBride period. Russell eschewed the left-wing tendencies of the 1920s and 30s IRA and pushed for a more \"militarist\" approach.\n\n===The backing of the second D\u00e1il===\n{{main|Irish republican legitimism}}  \nOne of the first major moves by Russell was to shore up the political credibility of the IRA. As Chief of Staff, he was able to secure a powerful symbolic gesture from the \"rump\" of the second D\u00e1il, that is to say, elected members of the [[Second D\u00e1il]] who remained Republicans. 7 of these former TDs transferred what authority they believed they had as representatives of the second D\u00e1il to the IRA army council, thus, in their minds, rendering it the legitimate governing body of Ireland. The IRA felt this move gave them the authority to formally declare war on the [[United Kingdom]], which they would almost immediately do.\n\n===Ideological shift===\nThe IRA that emerged from the debacle of the Republican Congress would be inspired primarily by a conservative, strictly nationalist political outlook and was increasingly influenced by radical right-wing ideas based on [[Catholic social teaching]] such as [[corporatism]], [[distributism]] and even the fascist ideology of [[Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe]] which sent books, journals and posters to IRA internees imprisoned in the [[Curragh Camp|Curragh]]. Tarlach \u00d3 hUid, the editor of the IRA newspaper ''War News'', and Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Broin, a member of the IRA Army Council, became members of Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe, and the IRA Adjutant-General, [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Dubhghaill]], expressed his approval of the party in a letter to its leader [[Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Cuinneag\u00e1in]].<ref>[https://books.google.ie/books?id=0NTJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The IRA 1956\u201369: Rethinking the Republic''], Matt Treacey, page 35</ref><ref>''Architects of the Resurrection: Ailtir\u00ed na hAis\u00e9irghe and the fascist 'New Order' in Ireland'', R.M Douglas, page 168</ref>\n\n[[Antisemitic]] sentiments also began to be expressed including satisfaction at the 'cleansing fires' of the [[Wehrmacht]] driving the Jews out of Europe and accusations towards the Irish government of being dominated by \"Jews and freemasons\".<ref>[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/oh-heres-to-adolph-hitler-the-ira-and-the-nazis/ \u2018Oh here\u2019s to Adolph Hitler\u2019?

A year later IRA officers approached O'Duffy and asked him to join the organisation. While O'Duffy did not take up the offer, he was later invited to join Moss Twomey and Andrew Cooney in protesting the basing of American troops in Northern Ireland.<ref>''Eoin O'Duffy: A Self-Made Hero'', Fearghal McGarry, page 338</ref>\n\nIn 1940, prominent members and supporters of the IRA established [[C\u00f3ras na Poblachta]], which among its objectives called for the \"destruction of the Masonic Order in Ireland\" and the \"reversal of the cultural conquest of our country by England\", not excluding \"the employment of compulsion\" to that end.<ref>Douglas, page 78</ref> Many far-right figures joined the party including \u00d3 Cuinneag\u00e1in, who lead the party's youth wing, Aic\u00e9in, until its independence was terminated in 1942, and C\u00f3ras na Poblachta took on a strongly anti-semitic and pro-German character.<ref>Douglas, page 79-80</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|WW2}}<!-- [[IRA in World War II]] redirects here -->World War II: The IRA, The Emergency, links to Nazi Germany==\n{{main|IRA Abwehr World War II|S-Plan|Northern Campaign (IRA)|The Emergency (Ireland)}}\n[[File:IRA.Coventry.attack.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the [[1939 Coventry bombing]]]]\n[[File:James O'Donovan.png|thumb|180px|right|[[Seamus O'Donovan]] was a key figure in organising the [[S-Plan]] in 1939-40.

The so-called \"S-Plan\" saw IRA operatives based in Britain bombing British infrastructure, with a view to weakening their war effort.\n\nOn 23 December 1939, IRA members stole almost the entire reserve ammunition store of the Irish Army from the [[Magazine Fort]] in Dublin's [[Phoenix Park]]. This became known as the \"[[Christmas Raid]]\" in IRA folklore. The [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) found two and a half tons of the stolen ammunition inside [[County Armagh]] on 2 January 1940. The next day the Irish Minister for Justice, [[Gerald Boland]], at an emergency session of the D\u00e1il, introduced the Emergency Powers Bill to reinstate internment, Military Tribunal, and executions for IRA members. It was rushed through and given its third reading the next day creating the Emergency Powers Act. It was later used to execute at least six IRA volunteers in Ireland between 1940 and 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/19125|title=Remembering the Past: Executed IRA men reinterred {{!}} An Phoblacht|website=www.anphoblacht.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref> Peter Barnes and James McCormack who had been arrested in England shortly following an IRA bomb that exploded in Coventry on 25 August 1939 resulting in the deaths of several uninvolved English civilians, were executed on 7 February 1940. Republican publication An Phoblacht did not deny their mission in England and IRA membership but maintains that they were not involved with the Coventry bombing.\n\nBy 1941, the IRA numbered fewer than 1,000 members, many of whom were imprisoned. Most of its able political organisers had left in the mid- to late-1930s and its \"natural constituency\" had been appropriated by Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the IRA hoped for support from Germany to strike against Britain. [[Se\u00e1n Russell]] travelled to Germany in 1940 to canvass for arms. He became ill and died on board a German U-boat which was bringing him back to Ireland in August that year along with Frank Ryan (see [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]]). [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]], the acting Chief of Staff, prepared an invasion plan for Northern Ireland and sent it to German Intelligence in 1940; this plan was later called [[Plan Kathleen]], but it was discovered by the Irish authorities within one month of its creation. The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] opposed the IRA's collaboration with Nazi Germany, having adopted a position of neutrality.\n\nGunther Schuetz, a member of the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence), parachuted into Ireland and was almost immediately arrested. On 28 February 1942 he escaped. The IRA intended to send him back to Germany with a request for weapons, ammunition, explosives, radio equipment and money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.markhumphrys.com/sfira.nazis.html|title=The IRA supported the Nazis in WW2|website=www.markhumphrys.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> The IRA Army Executive met on 20 April and sanctioned the request. They also approved a plan to \"give military information to powers at war with England even before any definite contacts [were] established with these powers\", provided the information did not endanger civilians.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/secretarmyira00bell |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/secretarmyira00bell/page/224 224] |quote=to give military information to powers at war with England, which would not endanger civilian lives, even before any definite contacts have been established with these powers. |title=The Secret Army: The IRA |publisher=Transaction Publishers |author=J.

However, information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of raids such as the [[Belfast Blitz]] was based exclusively on the aerial reconnaissance of the [[Luftwaffe]].\n\nThe IRA was severely damaged by the measures taken against it by the governments on both sides of the border during the Second World War. IRA members were interned both north and south of the border, and a number of IRA men, including the chief of staff between 1942 and 1944, [[Charlie Kerins]], were executed by the Irish government for criminal offences committed during the war. Kerins had been tried and found guilty of the murder of a local police officer ([[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]]).\n\n==The Post-World War II IRA==\nFollowing [[World War II]], the IRA still existed but its numbers had been severely depleted. Some IRA units remained in the Irish countryside; however, they were cut off from any sort of command structure and bitterly demoralised. Out of touch with [[Dublin]], and with other units, IRA members became fewer and fewer. In 1945, one of the first attempts was made to create a centre in Dublin. The meeting consisted of Sean Ashe, Micksy Conway, [[Tony Magan]], Willie McGuinness, Bertie McCormack and a few others. They did not know who else would help, nor who had been in the Army. The problems were evident but no one had ready answers. The loss of all the GHQ staff and their records had left Dublin as isolated from the country as the country was from Dublin. Even though there was a lack of information and manpower, the obvious first step was to get some sort of unit going in Dublin. The next step was to resurrect the Army Executive and through it, the legitimate structure of the IRA.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Secret Army: The IRA|last=Bell|first=J.

Several of the leading members were also former left-wing IRA members and the party itself espoused itself as Republican. However, many of the militarists left within the IRA were not eager to support any political party which recognised the legitimacy of D\u00e1il Eireann, and indeed, the IRA banned its members from joining the Clann on the basis of they were not going to be an abstentionist party.<ref name=\"A Short History\"/> Nonetheless, they watched with curiosity as to how this party would fare. At first hopes for Clann na Poblachta were high, with some believing it would challenge Fianna F\u00e1il in the D\u00e1il. However shrewd electioneering by De Valera meant that the Clann did not become the great power they had hoped to be. They did, however, manage to enter government in 1948 as part of the coalition which made up the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]]. Unfortunately for the Clann, that government's run proved to be somewhat disastrous and permanently dented their support. In each subsequent election, the Clann received less and less support until it dissolved as a party in 1965.\n\nThe failure of Clann na Poblachta reinforced the IRA's doubts about the ability of left-wing political parties to wrestle power out of the hands of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael and helped spur the IRA towards traditionalism in the 1950s. However, their initial success did help convince the IRA they would have to marry their military tactics with political tactics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bell |first=J.

The \"three Macs\" believed that a political organisation was necessary to help rebuild the IRA. IRA members were instructed to join Sinn F\u00e9in en masse, and despite the IRA's small numbers following WW2, they were successfully able to fully take over the organisation. This coup d'\u00e9tat of Sinn F\u00e9in was made possible due to the weak state of Sinn F\u00e9in itself; the party had become a shell of its former self in the decades following Eamon De Valera taking the bulk of the membership with him when he split to form Fianna Fail in 1926. Paddy McLogan was named Sinn F\u00e9in president in 1950, with fellow IRA member [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Dubhghaill]] named Vice-President, signalling the IRA's complete control of the party's apparatus.<ref name=\"A Short History\"/><ref name=\"Inside the IRA\">{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Andrew |date=2011 |title=Inside the IRA: Dissident Republicans and the War for Legitimacy |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=PcdvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT16&dq=IRA+1950&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjovI_Y8pfmAhXLVBUIHfeiDR4Q6AEINzAC#v=onepage&q=sinn%20f%C3%A9in&f=false |location= |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page= |isbn=0748641122 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n===Ideology of the post-World War II IRA===\nUnder the new IRA leadership, Sinn F\u00e9in began to advocate a corporatist social policy inspired by the Papal Encyclicals of [[Pope Pius XI]], with the aim of creating a Catholic state, and opposed [[parliamentary democracy]], advocating its replacement with a form of government akin to [[Portugal]]'s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], but rejected fascism as they considered a fascist state to be too secular and centralized.<ref>''Irish republicanism and socialism: the politics of the republican movement, 1905 to 1994'', Pat Walsh, {{ISBN|9780850340716}}, p. 41 & 42</ref>\n\n==The Border campaign==\n{{main|Border Campaign (IRA)}}\nBeginning in the 1950s the IRA started planning for a renewed armed campaign, and in 1956 recent recruit [[Se\u00e1n Cronin]], who had considerable military experience, drew up a plan codenamed Operation Harvest.\n\nThe [[Border Campaign (IRA)|border campaign]], as it became known, involved various military columns carrying out a range of military operations, from direct attacks on security installations to disruptive actions against infrastructure. The campaign received, initially, significant support from the south. Support increased massively after the deaths of [[Se\u00e1n South]] and [[Fergal O'Hanlon]] in the [[Brookeborough|Brookeborough Raid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bordertours.ie/brookeborough-raid/|title=Brookeborough Raid \u00ab  Border Tours|website=www.bordertours.ie|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref> In the [[1957 Irish general election|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann election]]s held in 1957, Sinn F\u00e9in fielded 19 candidates and won four seats, and almost won a couple more in tightly contested elections. One of the four new Sinn F\u00e9in TDs would be future IRA Chief of Staff [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]].\n\nHowever, internment without trial, introduced first in Northern Ireland and then in the [[Republic of Ireland]], curtailed IRA operations and ultimately broke morale. Eighteen people in total were killed during the campaign, of whom seven were members of the RUC and eight were members of the IRA itself. The campaign was on the whole a failure. It petered out in the late 1950s and was officially ended in February 1962.\n\n==1960s: Marxist tendency and the 1969 split==\nIn the 1960s the IRA once more came under the influence of left-wing thinkers, especially those such as [[C.

By 1962 there were two factions in the Republican movement; the \"Curragh\" faction consisting of older IRA men who had served prison sentences together in the Curragh who favoured traditionalism and now controlled Sinn F\u00e9in such as Paddy McLogan, and a faction of younger, left-wing IRA members such as Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and Cathal Goulding who now controlled the IRA Army Council following post-Border campaign elections. The Curragh faction wanted to publicly declare that Sinn F\u00e9in had no part in calling off the Border campaign. They were told in stark terms they were to do no such thing, as, besides the fact this would undermine the IRA's decision to end the campaign, Sinn F\u00e9in would never have had any influence in the decision regardless, as only the IRA Army Council had the authority to begin or end campaigns. Furthermore, it was made clear by the IRA that, as far as they were concerned, Sinn F\u00e9in answered to the IRA, and not the other way around. This hardline stance by the IRA alienated the Curragh faction and many of them, including McLogan and Tony Magan, resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in in protest. In their wake, [[John Joe McGirl]] proposed Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh as the new leader of Sinn F\u00e9in and this was accepted. In September 1962 Cathal Goulding succeed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh as IRA Chief of Staff, leaving the new guard now in control of both Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA.<ref>{{cite book |last=Swan |first=Sean |date=2008 |title=Official Irish Republicanism, 1962 to 1972 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=jgra94rWmAAC&source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher= |page=81 |isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nThe move to a class-based political outlook and the consequent rejection of any stance that could be seen as sectarian\u2014including the use of IRA arms to defend one side, that side being the beleaguered Catholic communities of Belfast in the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]]\u2014was to be one of the factors in the 1969 split that led to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] wing of the republican movement, with the latter subscribing to a traditional Catholic/nationalist analysis of the situation while the Officials subscribed to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] view that internal strife among the working classes served only the interest of capital.<ref name=lost>''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, {{ISBN|1-84488-120-2}}</ref> The [[Department of Justice and Equality|Irish Department of Justice]] had noticed the tensions in March 1969 and advised the Dublin government to use them to fragment the IRA.<ref name=\"irishleftreview.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishleftreview.org/2009/08/31/lost-revolution-story-official-ira-workers-party-brian-hanley-scott-millar/|title=Irish Left Review - The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers Party by Brian Hanley & Scott Millar|work=Irish Left Review|accessdate=15 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725032721/http://www.irishleftreview.org/2009/08/31/lost-revolution-story-official-ira-workers-party-brian-hanley-scott-millar/|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Provisional IRA embarked on a [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|thirty-year armed campaign]] against the British presence in [[Northern Ireland]] that claimed 1,707 lives.<ref>University of Ulster ''Conflict Archive on the Internet'' (CAIN) database: http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/Organisation_Responsible.html visualised 3 March 2006.</ref> In 1997 it announced a ceasefire which effectively marked the end of its campaign.

The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] slow-jam serves as the [[lead single]] from ''Here I Am'' and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song.

It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. Rowland sang the song with Trey Songz at the [[BET Awards of 2011|2011 BET Awards]] ceremony.\n\n==Background and release==\n''Here I Am'' was originally scheduled for release in 2010, but was pushed back numerous times.
