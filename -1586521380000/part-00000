The Ganapati is known as Gunalaya Ganapati (abode of bliss) and as we circumbulate the shrine we find the  idol of [[Adi Shankara]] -just wee behind the main Shrine inside the Complex. We also find deities like [[Subrahmanya]] installed there. The [[Dakshinamurthy]] statue is in the Northern Koshta facing south and we come to the Sub complex Shrine of [[Kali]]. Adi Shankara is said to have installed a chakra to calm down the Devi and to make her Sowmya roopi (Calm and resplendent). To this day - a select group of Nampoothiri Families perform the pooja and aradhana to this Lord and Goddess as desired by Adi Shankara.\n\nThe name of the goddess at this temple is Vadivudaiamman alias Tripurasundari.

There were intermittent clashes initiated by both the parties and once resulted in attacking the sepoys involved in protection.{{sfn|Brimnes|1999| pp= 81-83}} The dissension cropped once more during 1828 when the officiating priest complained about the chief administrator.{{sfn|Mukund |2005| pp= 81-85}} In 1831, there were renewed complaints against the chief administrator over the authority of dancing girls and his right in administering the temple stating financial irregularity.{{sfn|Mukund |2005| pp= 81-85}} The dancing girls were immediately removed from the temple. The collector upheld the action against the dancing girls and ruled that Arunachala Chetti of the left-hand would be the rightful administrator of the temple.

The temple is revered by the ''[[Tevaram]]'' hymns of [[Saivite|Saiva]] [[nayanars]], the 7th century [[Tamil people|Tamil]] saint poets and classified as [[Paadal Petra Sthalam]].All the Three of Thevaram Moovar(Appar, Samandar and Sundarar) has rendered Thevaram songs in this temple. The temple is closely associated with the saint poet [[Sundarar]] and [[Pattinathar]]. The temple has been in vogue from the [[Pallava]] times of the 7th century and widely expanded by [[Chola]] kings during the 11th century. The temple has a seven tiered gateway tower, a tank, with the overall temple area covering 1 acre. The temple is administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The temple draws parallel with the [[Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur|Thygaraja temple]] in [[Tiruvarur]] as both the temples were expanded by [[Rajendra Chola I]] and both have the same dance poses of Shiva.

He received his second  [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962). He also appeared, sometimes as a hero and sometimes as a malefactor, in the major big-screen productions ''[[The Night Heaven Fell|Les bijoutiers du clair de lune]]'' (1958), ''[[The Bravados]]'' (1958), ''[[Imperial Venus (film)|Imperial Venus]]'' (1962), ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1964), ''[[Genghis Khan (1965 film)|Genghis Khan]]'' (1965), ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (1966) and ''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]'' (1968).\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nStephen Boyd \u2013 real name William Millar \u2013 was born in a house, long since demolished, at the corner of the Doagh Road, Whitehouse on 4 July 1931.<ref>[http://daggy.name/cop/bkofdead/99999989.htm Profile], daggy.name/cop/bkofdead; accessed 28 June 2014.</ref> Boyd was the youngest of nine siblings born to Irish/Canadian parents, James Alexander Millar and his wife Martha Boyd. At a very early age, William, or Billy as he was known, moved with the family to live in Glengormley. Boyd attended the local Public Elementary School and [[Ballyclare High School]], but at the age of fourteen Boyd quit school to take up other jobs to help support his family. He eventually joined the Ulster Group Theatre where he learned the behind the scenes tasks of the theatre. He became well known in Belfast for his contributions as a gravel-voiced policeman on the Ulster Radio program \"The McCooeys\", the story of a Belfast family written by Joseph Tomelty.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Journal News - White Plains New York, 09 Jul 1969''</ref><ref name=\"newsletter.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/blue-plaque-honour-for-ulster-born-hollywood-star-stephen-boyd-1-8552887|title=Blue plaque honour for Ulster-born Hollywood star Stephen Boyd|publisher=}}</ref> Boyd eventually worked his way up to character parts and then starring roles. By nineteen he had toured Canada with summer stock companies. In 1950 he made a coast to coast tour of America with the [[Clare Tree Major]] Company,<ref>''Stephen Boyd, The Man Who Never Wants to Pour Another Coffee, by John Neal''</ref> 1956 performing ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' <ref>''Daily News, NY, NY May 5, 1963''</ref> in the lead role as [[Stanley Kowalski]]. Boyd would later recall this as \"the best performance I ever gave in my life\". <ref>''Movieland Magazine interview December of 1962''</ref>\n\nBy the time he was twenty, Boyd had a wide range of theatre experience, but he longed for the big stage.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Movie Screen'' Stephen Boyd Interview, June 1960</ref> In 1952 Boyd moved to London and worked in a cafeteria and busked outside a cinema in Leicester Square to get money as he was literally close to starvation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Boyd caught his first break as a doorman at the Odeon Theatre. The Leicester Square Cinema across the street recruited him to usher attendees during the British Academy Awards in the early 1950s. During the awards ceremony he was noticed by actor Sir [[Michael Redgrave]], who used his connections to introduce Boyd to the director of the Windsor Repertory Group.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> At this point Boyd's stage career in the U.K. began to flourish with performances in \"The Deep Blue Sea\" and \"Barnett's Folly\" <ref>''Movieland'' Magazine, December 1962</ref>\n\n===Early roles===\nBoyd's first role which brought him acclaim<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19560405&id=X7cxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dOQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7080,904122&hl=en |title=Irish-Canadian Film Actor Gains Stardom in Big Part |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |page=28 |date=5 April 1956 |accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> was as an Irish spy in the movie ''[[The Man Who Never Was]]'', based on the book by [[Ewen Montagu]]. The movie was released in April 1956.\n\nShortly thereafter he signed a ten-year contract with [[20th Century Fox]] studios,<ref>''Hedda Hopper, Los Angeles Times, May 29, 1956''</ref> who began prepping him for Hollywood. But it would be a while until Boyd actually set foot on a Hollywood back-lot. Boyd's next stop was Portugal to make ''[[A Hill in Korea]]'', which also featured future stars [[Michael Caine]] and [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]].<ref>Michael Caine, ''What's it all About?'', page 114-115</ref> In June 1956, Boyd was cast in the nautical, ship-wreck adventure ''[[Seven Waves Away|Abandon Ship!]]'' for Columbia Studios starring [[Tyrone Power]]. This was filmed in the summer of 1956 in London where the British Navy  built a huge 35,000 gallon water tank for the movie.<ref>''St. Louis Dispatch'' 14 July 1956</ref>\n\nIn November 1956, for Twentieth Century Fox, Boyd traveled to the [[British West Indies]] as part of a large ensemble cast in [[Darryl Zanuck]]'s racially provocative film ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]] starring [[Dorothy Dandridge]]'', based on the [[Alec Waugh]] novel.<ref>''The Corpus Christi Caller, Nov 27, 1956''</ref> Boyd portrayed a young English aristocrat who becomes the lover of [[Joan Collins]]. Boyd would be loaned out to the [[J.

Even though this was a Hollywood production, the actual filming took place in [[Morelia]], Mexico.<ref>''Lee Belser, Lubbock Evening Journal, February 28, 1958''</ref>\n\n===''Ben-Hur''===\nAfter the filming of ''[[The Bravados]]'' was complete in late March 1958, Stephen Boyd returned to Hollywood to audition for the coveted role of Messala in [[MGM]]'s upcoming epic ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. Many other actors, including [[Victor Mature]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[Stewart Granger]] had been considered for the part,<ref>''The Los Angeles Times, April 17, 1958''</ref> but Stephen Boyd's screen test convinced director [[William Wyler]] that he had found the perfect villain for his epic, as Wyler had also admired Boyd's performance in ''[[The Man Who Never Was]]'' the previous year. Boyd was hurried off to join actor [[Charlton Heston]] in Rome in May 1958 to learn the chariot racing aspect of his role. Heston had already been practicing behind the chariot for weeks, so Boyd needed to learn quickly.

Far handsomer in person than on the screen&nbsp;... Stephen Boyd is a lean (180 pounds), well built (six-foot-one) charmer of 31, with a dazzling dimple, light brown curly hair, fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing. A man of tremendous vitality, a typical Celt, in many roles he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye. He dresses conservatively; speaks wittily, and extremely well, though he confesses that he's had almost no formal schooling; is genial and friendly ('I have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face').<ref>''Silver Screen'' Magazine, June 1960; \"Stephen Boyd - Sex Appeal + Blarney\" by Maxine Block</ref>}}\n\nJournalist [[Florabel Muir]] described Boyd's appeal in a feature from 1966. \"I would think it has to be his ruggedly masculine good looks. Strong, even craggy features, a wide sympathetic mouth, firm chin, athletic build, wavy dark brown hair, roving 185-lb. frame \u2013 all that plus a musical voice and the savoir faire of a much-traveled fellow \u2013 his films have taken him to many places in the world, and a rolling stone acquires a high polish.\" <ref>Florabel Muir, Valley Morning Star, 18 September 1966</ref>\n\nPersonally, Boyd was popular with Hollywood columnists, including his friend [[Hedda Hopper]], as well as fellow actors and other members of the entertainment industry because of his charm and sense of humor. \"Boyd is the kind of a man who was born to make friends and he has been doing it most of his life...Boyd is a blue-eyed, curly-haired chunk of masculinity, who makes no attempt to hide the fact that he just plain likes people. On the set of ''Ben-Hur'' he rarely occupied the fancy portable dressing room set aside for his use. Instead, he spent his time between scenes sitting around and chatting with electricians, carpenters and his fellow actors. He will discuss any subject and enjoys a good argument. He can, like most Irishmen, sprinkle his talk with wit as well as sagacity.\" <ref>\"The Evening Standard\", Stephen Boyd Prefers Villain Role in ''Ben-Hur'', Pennsylvania, 14 October 1960</ref>\n\nBoyd was first married in 1958 to Italian-born MCA executive Mariella Di Sarzana during the filming of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.

I hadn't been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake. She is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other. I suppose I wasn't ready for marriage.

Many other actors, including [[Victor Mature]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[Stewart Granger]] had been considered for the part,<ref>''The Los Angeles Times, April 17, 1958''</ref> but Stephen Boyd's screen test convinced director [[William Wyler]] that he had found the perfect villain for his epic, as Wyler had also admired Boyd's performance in ''[[The Man Who Never Was]]'' the previous year. Boyd was hurried off to join actor [[Charlton Heston]] in Rome in May 1958 to learn the chariot racing aspect of his role. Heston had already been practicing behind the chariot for weeks, so Boyd needed to learn quickly. Boyd was also required to wear brown contact lenses as Messala, which irritated his eyes and caused vision problems for a few months after the movie was completed.

In Gore Vidal's autobiography \"Palimpsest,\"<ref name=\"Gore Vidal pages 303\">''Palimpsest by Gore Vidal, pages 303 to 307, published in 1996''</ref> Vidal describes his discussion first with director [[William Wyler]], concerning Messala's underlying motivation, namely that Messala and Judah Ben-Hur had previously been lovers.

He dresses conservatively; speaks wittily, and extremely well, though he confesses that he's had almost no formal schooling; is genial and friendly ('I have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face').<ref>''Silver Screen'' Magazine, June 1960; \"Stephen Boyd - Sex Appeal + Blarney\" by Maxine Block</ref>}}\n\nJournalist [[Florabel Muir]] described Boyd's appeal in a feature from 1966. \"I would think it has to be his ruggedly masculine good looks. Strong, even craggy features, a wide sympathetic mouth, firm chin, athletic build, wavy dark brown hair, roving 185-lb. frame \u2013 all that plus a musical voice and the savoir faire of a much-traveled fellow \u2013 his films have taken him to many places in the world, and a rolling stone acquires a high polish.\" <ref>Florabel Muir, Valley Morning Star, 18 September 1966</ref>\n\nPersonally, Boyd was popular with Hollywood columnists, including his friend [[Hedda Hopper]], as well as fellow actors and other members of the entertainment industry because of his charm and sense of humor. \"Boyd is the kind of a man who was born to make friends and he has been doing it most of his life...Boyd is a blue-eyed, curly-haired chunk of masculinity, who makes no attempt to hide the fact that he just plain likes people. On the set of ''Ben-Hur'' he rarely occupied the fancy portable dressing room set aside for his use. Instead, he spent his time between scenes sitting around and chatting with electricians, carpenters and his fellow actors. He will discuss any subject and enjoys a good argument. He can, like most Irishmen, sprinkle his talk with wit as well as sagacity.\" <ref>\"The Evening Standard\", Stephen Boyd Prefers Villain Role in ''Ben-Hur'', Pennsylvania, 14 October 1960</ref>\n\nBoyd was first married in 1958 to Italian-born MCA executive Mariella Di Sarzana during the filming of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. They separated after just three weeks. Concerning his short-lived marriage to Sarzana, Boyd would explain, \"It was my fault. I'm an Irish so-and-so when I'm working. I hadn't been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake. She is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other. I suppose I wasn't ready for marriage. Maybe I was still too much of an adolescent.\" <ref>''Screen Album'', August\u2013October 1960, page 46.</ref> They officially divorced in early 1959.<ref>''The Free Lance-Star'' 20 December 1958, \"The Divorce Set\"</ref> After his divorce Boyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life, dating several prominent Hollywood starlets throughout the 1960s.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19600428&id=hQswAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_QAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5317,6024126&hl=en \"Stephen Boyd Serious In Romantic Ventures\"] ''Toledo Blade'', 28 April 1960</ref> His secretary Elizabeth Mills was a permanent resident at his Tarzana home during these years, though the two did not marry until 1974.<ref>''Movie Life Jan 1963'', article, \"Let me tell you about Steve Boyd (his very best friend reveals all\" and  The Courier Journal (Louisville Kentucky), 30 December 1962, \"Stephen Boyd is Glad he Escaped Cleopatra with Liz Taylor\" : Excerpt, \"There's an English girl who looks after his house in the Valley here, but marriage does not seem to be on their agenda.\"</ref>\n\nBoyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and French icon [[Brigitte Bardot]]. Boyd starred in two movies with Bardot&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[The Night Heaven Fell]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]'' in 1968. During the filming of ''[[Shalako]]'' in Almeria, Spain, Bardot and Boyd's close relationship and open affection for each other sparked numerous rumors of a possible affair.<ref name=\"Photoplay Film 1968\">''Photoplay Film'', September 1968, \"Boyd and Bardot- the Truth Behind Those Rumors\"</ref> It even caused Brigitte's husband at the time, [[Gunter Sachs]], to ask for a divorce.<ref>''The Milwaukee Journal'', 8 March 1968</ref> In Bardot's autobiography, she described the events and states that Boyd \"was never her lover, but a tender and attentive friend.\"<ref>\"Stephen n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mon amant, mais uniquement un ami tendre et attentionn\u00e9!\" Bardot, Brigitte.

I adore her.\" <ref name=\"Photoplay Film 1968\"/> Even though both actors denied the affair, the press was \"convinced there was a romance afoot, that Brigitte and Boyd openly displayed their affection for each other, but that publication of the report on their romance cooled it.\" <ref>\"Boyd on Bardot\", Photolay Film Monthly, September 1968, Raymond Palmer Interviews Stephen Boyd</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolores Hart en Stephen Boyd (1961).jpg|thumb|Hart and Boyd in 1961]]\nBoyd also had a close relationship with actress [[Dolores Hart]].

''The Ear of the Heart'', 2013</ref> Boyd eventually rejected her advances, but they remained close friends even after she turned to the cloistered life of a nun in 1963.
