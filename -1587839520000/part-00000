Charles sought to secure the large [[arsenal]] held in [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. He first approached the town in late April 1642, but was rebuffed by the town's [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] governor, [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]]. Charles retreated to [[York]], but in July he received news that Hotham might be willing to hand over the town if the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] approached with a large enough force that Hotham could surrender with his honour intact. \n\nCharles marched towards the town with an army of 4,000 men. In the meantime, Hull had been reinforced by sea, and Parliament had sent Sir [[John Meldrum]] to command the town's garrison, as they were concerned about Hotham's loyalty. Hotham once again rejected the King's demands to enter the town, and a largely ineffective siege was established by the Royalists, commanded by the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]] as the King had returned to York. Meldrum led a series of successful sallies from the town, and after a particularly effective one on 27 July, which destroyed a Royalist magazine to the west of the town, Lindsey lifted the siege and withdrew the King's forces to York. \n\n==Background==\n{{Location map many|UK Northern England|caption = Northern England; key locations 1642|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = left\n|label =  Newcastle|pos=left|lat_deg= 54|lat_min= 58|lon_deg = -1 |lon_min = -36\n|label3 = Hull |pos3= left|lat3_deg=53|lat3_min = 45|lon3_deg = 0|lon3_min = -20\n|label4 = Bradford |pos4= left|lat4_deg=53|lat4_min = 48|lon4_deg = -1|lon4_min = -45\n|label5 = York|pos5=left|lat5_deg=53|lat5_min =58 |lon5_deg = -1 |lon5_min = -5\n|label6 = Keyingham|pos6=right|lat6_deg=53|lat6_min = 42 |lon6_deg = 0 |lon6_min = -7\n|label7 = Nottingham|pos7=right|lat7_deg=52|lat7_min = 57 |lon7_deg = -1 |lon7_min = -09\n}}\nIn 1642, disagreements between the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and its monarch on religious, fiscal and legislative matters had been ongoing for over half a century.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|pp=344\u2013348}} At the beginning of January that year, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] unsuccessfully attempted to [[Five members|arrest five Members of Parliament]] (MPs) who were opposing him.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=131}} Having failed, and realising that Parliament had more support in London than he did, Charles fled the capital, and both sides began preparing for war.{{sfn|Cooke|2004|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Hull===\nIn the 17th century, [[Kingston upon Hull]], or Hull, was the second largest town in Yorkshire; with a population of 7,000, only the northern capital of [[York]] was bigger.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=9}} Access to the [[North Sea]] meant it was the primary export point for manufactured goods produced in Northern England; while its position at the confluence of the [[River Hull|Hull]] and [[River Humber|Humber]] rivers also made it the centre of an inland trade route.<ref>Hull's Maritime History.</ref> \n\nIn his military history of Yorkshire, David Cooke called it \"a very important town\",{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=131}} while the ''[[Victoria County History]]'' described it as \"strategically important\".{{sfn|Allison|1969|pp=90\u2013171}} Its arms magazine in Lowgate was the second largest in England after the [[Tower of London]]; in 1642, it contained 120 artillery pieces, 7,000 barrels of powder, and weapons for 16,000 to 20,000 men.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=10}}{{sfn|Ryder|1989|p=139}} \n\nThe town's position made it naturally very defensible.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=9}} It had been fortified in the fourteenth century, and these defences were enhanced over time.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=89}} By the 1630s, Hull was completely enclosed by walls; on the west bank of the river Hull, on which the town itself sat, medieval walls fronted by a ditch and interspersed with 25 towers were located on all but the river-side of the town. On the east bank, a {{convert|3|metre|ft|spell=in|adj=mid|-thick}} [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] featuring three [[blockhouse]]s had been erected during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ({{reign|1509|1547}}).{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=116}} \n\nIn preparation for the [[Bishops' Wars]], further improvements were made to the defences: the ditch was cleaned out, and an additional ditch dug. Between the two ditches batteries were installed near the gates, and [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] connected them to create a new outer perimeter. Drawbridges were installed at both Beverley Gate and North Gate, and the town was supplied with additional artillery.{{sfn|Evans|2017|pp=126\u2013127}} [[Sluice|Sluice gates]] were also placed on the two rivers to enable the garrison to flood low-lying land surrounding the town.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=130}} The historian Andrew Hopper described Hull as being \"arguably the strongest fortress town in England.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=9}}\n\nUnlike most of Yorkshire, which had a mix of MPs favouring Parliament or the King, Hull and the surrounding [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] had returned exclusively Parliament-favouring members. The area was also religiously opposed to the King, having a strong [[Puritan]] population.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|pp=10\u201311}} Within Hull itself, MPs were typically chosen for their willingness to stand-up for the town, rather than any underlying political or religious beliefs, as the town's [[corporation]] was interested in maintaining its own interests in the town without external influence.{{sfn|Allison|1969|pp=90\u2013171}}\n\n===Sir John Hotham===\n[[File:SirJohnHotham 1stBt ByCornelis Janssen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]]]]\n[[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] fought in the [[Palatinate campaign]] of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the early part of the seventeenth century, before later being returned as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of Parliament]] for [[Beverley (UK Parliament constituency)|Beverley]] in the East Riding. He was a favourite of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]], who appointed him as governor of Hull in 1628. Hotham opposed both the King and Wentworth during the Bishops' Wars, and was replaced as governor in 1639. The following year he withheld reinforcements from Wentworth, for which he was stripped of more of his positions.{{sfn|Healy|2010}} Hotham was renowned for being easily offended, and was described by [[Sir Hugh Cholmeley, 1st Baronet|Sir Hugh Cholmeley]] as often letting his emotions overcome his better judgement.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=7}} He felt slighted by the loss of his commissions, and turned into a political opponent of the King in Parliament,{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=130}} where he became one of the most vocal members.{{sfn|Scott|2008}}\n\n==Prelude==\nDue to the large arsenal in Hull, both sides were eager to gain control of the city. On 11 January, Charles appointed the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] as the governor of Hull and commanded him to take and hold the town for the Royalist cause.{{sfn|Hopper|2016|p=225}} Around the same time, Hotham was given the same position and orders by Parliament.{{sfn|Black|2002|p=154}} Newcastle arrived at Hull on 15 January with letters from the King offering pardons to the townspeople and ordering them to allow him access to the magazine. Wary of the reception he might receive, he initially attempted to gain entry under the pseudonym of \"Sir John Savage\", but was recognised and forced to reveal his true identity.{{sfn|Rushworth|1721|pp=564\u2013580}} Lacking military might or local influence, Newcastle was unable to gain entry, and sent a message to the King saying \"the town will not admit me by any means, so I am very flat and out of countenance here.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2016|p=225}} Hotham's son, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], an MP for [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], arrived outside Hull three days later, backed by around 300 of his father's militia.{{sfn|Hopper|2016|p=225}}{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=11}} Captain Hotham was also refused entry to the town, but after threatening to report them to Parliament, he spread rumours that local Catholics and the Spanish were planning to attack the town, and was finally allowed entry under emergency terms.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=11}}\n\nDespite the manoeuvrings between the King and Parliament, there remained an illusion that the two sides were still governing the country together. This illusion ended when Charles moved north, fearing that he would be captured if he remained in the south of England.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2014|p=39}} He arrived in [[York]], roughly {{convert|35|miles}} north-west of Hull, on 18 March. Around the same time, Sir John Hotham arrived in Hull to assume governorship of the town, and was given orders from Parliament \"not to admit any forces into Hull without orders from both houses of Parliament.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} The garrison was increased to roughly 1,000 soldiers,{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=62}} but despite this Parliament was wary about the close proximity of the King's forces, and ordered that the town's magazine should be transported to London.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2014|p=39}}\n\n===King Charles demands entry===\n[[File:Charles I Demanding Entrance at the Beverley Gate, Hull, 23 April 1642.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th-century painting, depicting [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] demanding entrance to Hull.]]\nEager to capture the magazine before it could be moved to London,{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} Charles rode towards Hull himself. He sent a small retinue ahead, consisting of his eight-year-old son\u2014the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] (later King James II of England)\u2014and his nephew\u2014the deposed [[Elector Palatine]] [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles Louis]]\u2014along with some members of the nobility and fifty men. The group were admitted into the town on 22 April, and hosted by the town's mayor and aldermen. Charles Louis told the mayor that they planned to meet the King on his way to the town the next day. Accordingly, on the next morning, Sir [[Lewis Dyve]] arrived at the gates, and announced that King Charles intended to dine in the town that day. Hotham held a meeting with the town's leaders and they resolved not to allow Charles to enter Hull, and duly secured the town gates and lifted the drawbridges.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}}\n\nCharles approached Beverley Gate on the morning of 23 April,{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=131}} accompanied by many local nobles, the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]], the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] and a large army from the local trained bands. The King's [[herald]]s announced his arrival, and then demanded that he be allowed entry to the town and the magazine, on the basis that it was property of the Crown.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}} Hotham stood on top of the low wall next to the gate,{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} and announced that despite his loyalty to the King,{{sfn|Scott|2008}} he could not allow the King and his army to enter the town without breaking the trust placed in him by Parliament. Doing so, he explained, would label him \"the odious name of villain and faith-breaker.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} He offered to allow the King entry with a small escort of twelve men, but when the King demanded thirty, Hotham demurred, worried that it could rouse Royalist sympathisers in the town. The two sides continued to dispute matters until the early evening,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}} during which time Hotham agreed to provide food for the King, which he had lowered from the town walls.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=62}} Frustrated, the King declared Hotham a traitor and suggested that he should be thrown from the walls by the townspeople, but the declaration had no effect, and the Royalists withdrew to Beverley.{{sfn|Cooke|2004|p=16}} \n\nParliament responded to the King's charge of treason by stating that Hotham had only been following their orders, and that the King had breached Parliamentary privilege by branding Hotham a traitor.{{sfn|Scott|2008}} This declaration from Parliament brought Hotham to national attention; as was typical during the civil war, Parliament celebrated its victory over the King by [[Pamphlet wars|publishing propaganda]]. A speech made by Hotham on 23 May, in which he justified his actions in defying Charles, was published in [[pamphlet]] form, and for a time those that favoured Parliament were known as 'Hothamites'. In response, a picture was published suggesting that Hotham felt he was superior to the King: Parliament ordered the picture to be ceremonially burned.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}}\n\nHotham was worried about the prospect of unrest and rebellion within Hull. At the end of April, Parliament announced that should he be killed his son would replace him as governor. To try and prevent desertions, he spread rumours that the King had ordered any soldiers caught outside the city walls to be killed. By the end of May, in response to demands from Hotham that others \"share in his dangers and responsibilities\", Parliament sent [[Sir William Armine, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Airmyn]], [[Sir William Strickland, 1st Baronet|Sir William Strickland]], [[John Alured]], [[Michael Warton (died 1645)|Michael Warton]], Henry Darley and [[Peregrine Pelham]] to Hull with Captain Hotham.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|pp=12\u201314}} During May, Parliament had also transported the majority of the weapons from Hull on four boats; around three-quarters of what had been housed in the town arrived in London on 30 May.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}}\n\n==Siege==\nAfter rebuffing the King in April, Hotham had to put down several plots from within Hull to betray the town.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=14}} In his [[The History of the Rebellion|account of the Civil War]], the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] suggested that Hotham was meanwhile planning to hand the town over to the King himself.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=14}} [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Lord Digby]] had been captured by a Parliamentarian ship, but pretended to be a Frenchman who did not speak English. He was taken to Hull, where he met with Hotham and admitted his true identity. Digby tried to persuade Hotham to surrender Hull to the King. The two agreed that if the King approached the town with a sufficient force, then Hotham could make a show of resisting, before honourably surrendering the town.{{sfn|Durston|1995|p=241}} Digby travelled to York, still disguised as a Frenchman, and informed Charles of the plan.{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=187}}\n\n[[File:Sir_John_Meldrum.png|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[John Meldrum]] was sent by Parliament to both assist Hotham, and ensure his loyalty.]]On 3 July,{{sfn|Newman|1998|p=5}} Charles marched from York with 3,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=128}} On arrival, rather than admitting the King as agreed, Hotham held fast against the King's demands to enter. Hull defences had been further improved, and the poorly trained and equipped army the King had brought was insufficient to storm the town. Charles had contemplated trying to blockade Hull, but had been told by [[Thomas Glemham]], a former governor, that the town was so low-lying that surface water was easily accessible, and Parliament's control of the navy meant that it could be easily replenished by sea.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}} Parliament sent further reinforcements (recorded as between 500 and 1,500) which arrived by sea on 10 July, led by Sir [[John Meldrum]].{{sfn|Reckitt|1952|p=59}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}} In addition to supplementing the garrison, Meldrum had been sent by Parliament to command the garrison, as they were growing suspicious of Hotham's loyalty.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}} To make the town more defensible, Hotham ordered the sluice gates be opened, and that the banks of the Humber should be breached to allow the high spring tide to flood the land around the town. He also had buildings beyond the town walls destroyed to remove any cover the King's army could use during an attack; this included the [[Charterhouse, Kingston upon Hull|Carthusian hospital building]] to the north, and the village of Myton to the west.{{sfn|Evans|2017|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThough Parliament controlled the navy, the Royalists did manage to send one ship up the river Humber as far as [[Keyingham]], {{convert|10|miles}} east of Hull, where they offloaded eight artillery guns which they then transported across land to establish a battery on the eastern side of the town. Forts were also established in [[Paull]], [[Hessle]] and on the southern bank of the Humber, in order to fire at ships using the river.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=129}} The siege of Hull is variously described as commencing from either 10 July or 15 July,{{sfn|Newman|1998|p=5}}{{sfn|Rayner|2004|p=186}} and a sally made by Meldrum is often attributed as the \"first blood\" of the First English Civil War.{{sfn|Carlton|2008}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=20}} According to [[John Rushworth]], Meldrum attacked the King's forces with 500 men. The Royalist cavalry were not backed up by their infantry, and in the face of the attack retreated towards Beverley. Meldrum's force made chase, killing two and capturing thirty.{{sfn|Rushworth|1721|pp=580\u2013612}} At this early stage of the war, siege warfare in Britain was largely ineffective; methods that had been developed and refined in the European wars were applied without the skill and experience required.{{sfn|Burke|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Charles, having been frustrated in his efforts to capture the town, withdrew from Hull, leaving the Earl of Lindsey in command of his forces.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=62}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}}{{efn|In his histories, David Cooke lists command passing instead to the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]],{{sfn|Cooke|2004|p=18}}{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=132}} but the majority of sources list it being given to Lindsey.}} Another sortie by Meldrum on 27 July attacked the Royalist arsenal in [[Anlaby]], to the west of Hull,{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=129}} capturing fifteen cannons and a {{convert|36|lb}} mortar.{{sfn|Carlton|2008}} After this loss, the Royalists lifted the siege and retreated to York.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nLess than four weeks after retreating from Hull, on 22 August 1642, Charles I raised his [[Royal standards of England|royal standard]] at [[Nottingham]]. He declared the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the formal start of the First English Civil War.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} Securing Hull and its arsenal ensured the Parliamentarian army began the war better equipped than their opponents, and is viewed by historian IE Ryder as \"one of the pivotal actions\" for the first year of the conflict.{{sfn|Ryder|1989|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nIn September 1642, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]] signed a non-aggression pact with local Royalists in an attempt to maintain peace in Yorkshire. Hotham disagreed with the move, and after making strong declarations against the pact, he broke it by attacking [[Selby]] and [[Cawood Castle]] in early October, after which the Royalists retaliated by attacking Fairfax's headquarters in [[Bradford]].{{sfn|Hopper|2011|pp=14\u201315}} Hotham's doubts about defying the King remained: fuelled by his disagreements with Fairfax, Hotham tried to negotiation a defection with the Earl of Newcastle.{{sfn|Scott|2008}} Captain Hotham was arrested for disloyalty by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in June 1643 but managed to escape. Concerned that both father and son were going to defect, Parliament ordered [[Matthew Boynton]] to take control of Hull, which he did on 29 June. Hotham escaped to Beverley, where he was captured and taken to London. Both Hothams were sent to the Tower of London as prisoners, tried and sentenced to death. Despite reprieves and a vote in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], they were executed at the end of January 1645.{{sfn|Scott|2008}}\n\nDuring 1642, the Parliamentarians had the upper hand in the East Riding of Yorkshire, but they suffered territorial losses early the following year, and by June they only held a few towns in the area, including Hull. In August, a Royalist army of 16,000 men commanded by the Earl of Newcastle captured Beverley, forcing Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]], the son of Lord Fairfax, to retreat to Hull. The town was [[Siege of Hull (1643)|besieged for the second time]] in the war between 2 September and 12 October. Newcastle bombarded Hull from a series of siege forts armed with eighteen artillery guns. Although the town suffered heavy damage from the attacks, it was once again able to be replenished by sea, and in early October Parliamentarian sallies damaged or captured some of the siege forts. Along with a Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Winceby]], this led Newcastle to lift the siege and retreat to York.{{sfn|Evans|2017|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/yorks/east/vol1/pp90-171 |chapter=Hull in the 16th and 17th centuries |title=A History of the County of York East Riding: Volume 1, the City of Kingston Upon Hull |editor-last=Allison |editor-first=K.

Charles sought to secure the large [[arsenal]] held in [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. He first approached the town in late April 1642, but was rebuffed by the town's [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] governor, [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]]. Charles retreated to [[York]], but in July he received news that Hotham might be willing to hand over the town if the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] approached with a large enough force that Hotham could surrender with his honour intact. \n\nCharles marched towards the town with an army of 4,000 men. In the meantime, Hull had been reinforced by sea, and Parliament had sent Sir [[John Meldrum]] to command the town's garrison, as they were concerned about Hotham's loyalty. Hotham once again rejected the King's demands to enter the town, and a largely ineffective siege was established by the Royalists, commanded by the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]] as the King had returned to York. Meldrum led a series of successful sallies from the town, and after a particularly effective one on 27 July, which destroyed a Royalist magazine to the west of the town, Lindsey lifted the siege and withdrew the King's forces to York. \n\n==Background==\n{{Location map many|UK Northern England|caption = Northern England; key locations 1642|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = left\n|label =  Newcastle|pos=left|lat_deg= 54|lat_min= 58|lon_deg = -1 |lon_min = -36\n|label3 = Hull |pos3= left|lat3_deg=53|lat3_min = 45|lon3_deg = 0|lon3_min = -20\n|label4 = Bradford |pos4= left|lat4_deg=53|lat4_min = 48|lon4_deg = -1|lon4_min = -45\n|label5 = York|pos5=left|lat5_deg=53|lat5_min =58 |lon5_deg = -1 |lon5_min = -5\n|label6 = Keyingham|pos6=right|lat6_deg=53|lat6_min = 42 |lon6_deg = 0 |lon6_min = -7\n|label7 = Nottingham|pos7=right|lat7_deg=52|lat7_min = 57 |lon7_deg = -1 |lon7_min = -09\n}}\nIn 1642, disagreements between the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and its monarch on religious, fiscal and legislative matters had been ongoing for over half a century.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|pp=344\u2013348}} At the beginning of January that year, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] unsuccessfully attempted to [[Five members|arrest five Members of Parliament]] (MPs) who were opposing him.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=131}} Having failed, and realising that Parliament had more support in London than he did, Charles fled the capital, and both sides began preparing for war.{{sfn|Cooke|2004|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Hull===\nIn the 17th century, [[Kingston upon Hull]], or Hull, was the second largest town in Yorkshire; with a population of 7,000, only the northern capital of [[York]] was bigger.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=9}} Access to the [[North Sea]] meant it was the primary export point for manufactured goods produced in Northern England; while its position at the confluence of the [[River Hull|Hull]] and [[River Humber|Humber]] rivers also made it the centre of an inland trade route.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hull's Maritime History |url=http://hullhistorycentre.org.uk/research/research-guides/maritime-history.aspx |website=Hull History Centre |accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nIn his military history of Yorkshire, David Cooke called it \"a very important town\",{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=131}} while the ''[[Victoria County History]]'' described it as \"strategically important\".{{sfn|Allison|1969|pp=90\u2013171}} Its arms magazine in Lowgate was the second largest in England after the [[Tower of London]]; in 1642, it contained 120 artillery pieces, 7,000 barrels of powder, and weapons for 16,000 to 20,000 men.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=10}}{{sfn|Ryder|1989|p=139}} \n\nThe town's position made it naturally very defensible.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=9}} It had been fortified in the fourteenth century, and these defences were enhanced over time.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=89}} By the 1630s, Hull was completely enclosed by walls; on the west bank of the river Hull, on which the town itself sat, medieval walls fronted by a ditch and interspersed with 25 towers were located on all but the river-side of the town. On the east bank, a {{convert|3|metre|ft|spell=in|adj=mid|-thick}} [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] featuring three [[blockhouse]]s had been erected during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ({{reign|1509|1547}}).{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=116}} \n\nIn preparation for the [[Bishops' Wars]], further improvements were made to the defences: the ditch was cleaned out, and an additional ditch dug. Between the two ditches batteries were installed near the gates, and [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] connected them to create a new outer perimeter. Drawbridges were installed at both Beverley Gate and North Gate, and the town was supplied with additional artillery.{{sfn|Evans|2017|pp=126\u2013127}} [[Sluice|Sluice gates]] were also placed on the two rivers to enable the garrison to flood low-lying land surrounding the town.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=130}} The historian Andrew Hopper described Hull as being \"arguably the strongest fortress town in England.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=9}}\n\nUnlike most of Yorkshire, which had a mix of MPs favouring Parliament or the King, Hull and the surrounding [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] had returned exclusively Parliament-favouring members. The area was also religiously opposed to the King, having a strong [[Puritan]] population.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|pp=10\u201311}} Within Hull itself, MPs were typically chosen for their willingness to stand-up for the town, rather than any underlying political or religious beliefs, as the town's [[corporation]] was interested in maintaining its own interests in the town without external influence.{{sfn|Allison|1969|pp=90\u2013171}}\n\n===Sir John Hotham===\n[[File:SirJohnHotham 1stBt ByCornelis Janssen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]]]]\n[[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] fought in the [[Palatinate campaign]] of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the early part of the seventeenth century, before later being returned as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of Parliament]] for [[Beverley (UK Parliament constituency)|Beverley]] in the East Riding. He was a favourite of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]], who appointed him as governor of Hull in 1628. Hotham opposed both the King and Wentworth during the Bishops' Wars, and was replaced as governor in 1639. The following year he withheld reinforcements from Wentworth, for which he was stripped of more of his positions.{{sfn|Healy|2010}} Hotham was renowned for being easily offended, and was described by [[Sir Hugh Cholmeley, 1st Baronet|Sir Hugh Cholmeley]] as often letting his emotions overcome his better judgement.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=7}} He felt slighted by the loss of his commissions, and turned into a political opponent of the King in Parliament,{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=130}} where he became one of the most vocal members.{{sfn|Scott|2008}}\n\n==Prelude==\nDue to the large arsenal in Hull, both sides were eager to gain control of the city. On 11 January, Charles appointed the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] as the governor of Hull and commanded him to take and hold the town for the Royalist cause.{{sfn|Hopper|2016|p=225}} Around the same time, Hotham was given the same position and orders by Parliament.{{sfn|Black|2002|p=154}} Newcastle arrived at Hull on 15 January with letters from the King offering pardons to the townspeople and ordering them to allow him access to the magazine. Wary of the reception he might receive, he initially attempted to gain entry under the pseudonym of \"Sir John Savage\", but was recognised and forced to reveal his true identity.{{sfn|Rushworth|1721|pp=564\u2013580}} Lacking military might or local influence, Newcastle was unable to gain entry, and sent a message to the King saying \"the town will not admit me by any means, so I am very flat and out of countenance here.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2016|p=225}} Hotham's son, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], an MP for [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], arrived outside Hull three days later, backed by around 300 of his father's militia.{{sfn|Hopper|2016|p=225}}{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=11}} Captain Hotham was also refused entry to the town, but after threatening to report them to Parliament, he spread rumours that local Catholics and the Spanish were planning to attack the town, and was finally allowed entry under emergency terms.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=11}}\n\nDespite the manoeuvrings between the King and Parliament, there remained an illusion that the two sides were still governing the country together. This illusion ended when Charles moved north, fearing that he would be captured if he remained in the south of England.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2014|p=39}} He arrived in [[York]], roughly {{convert|35|miles}} north-west of Hull, on 18 March. Around the same time, Sir John Hotham arrived in Hull to assume governorship of the town, and was given orders from Parliament \"not to admit any forces into Hull without orders from both houses of Parliament.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} The garrison was increased to roughly 1,000 soldiers,{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=62}} but despite this Parliament was wary about the close proximity of the King's forces, and ordered that the town's magazine should be transported to London.{{sfn|Wanklyn|Jones|2014|p=39}}\n\n===King Charles demands entry===\n[[File:Charles I Demanding Entrance at the Beverley Gate, Hull, 23 April 1642.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th-century painting, depicting [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] demanding entrance to Hull.]]\nEager to capture the magazine before it could be moved to London,{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} Charles rode towards Hull himself. He sent a small retinue ahead, consisting of his eight-year-old son\u2014the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] (later King James II of England)\u2014and his nephew\u2014the deposed [[Elector Palatine]] [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles Louis]]\u2014along with some members of the nobility and fifty men. The group were admitted into the town on 22 April, and hosted by the town's mayor and aldermen. Charles Louis told the mayor that they planned to meet the King on his way to the town the next day. Accordingly, on the next morning, Sir [[Lewis Dyve]] arrived at the gates, and announced that King Charles intended to dine in the town that day. Hotham held a meeting with the town's leaders and they resolved not to allow Charles to enter Hull, and duly secured the town gates and lifted the drawbridges.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}}\n\nCharles approached Beverley Gate on the morning of 23 April,{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=131}} accompanied by many local nobles, the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]], the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] and a large army from the local trained bands. The King's [[herald]]s announced his arrival, and then demanded that he be allowed entry to the town and the magazine, on the basis that it was property of the Crown.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}} Hotham stood on top of the low wall next to the gate,{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} and announced that despite his loyalty to the King,{{sfn|Scott|2008}} he could not allow the King and his army to enter the town without breaking the trust placed in him by Parliament. Doing so, he explained, would label him \"the odious name of villain and faith-breaker.\"{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}} He offered to allow the King entry with a small escort of twelve men, but when the King demanded thirty, Hotham demurred, worried that it could rouse Royalist sympathisers in the town. The two sides continued to dispute matters until the early evening,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}} during which time Hotham agreed to provide food for the King, which he had lowered from the town walls.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=62}} Frustrated, the King declared Hotham a traitor and suggested that he should be thrown from the walls by the townspeople, but the declaration had no effect, and the Royalists withdrew to Beverley.{{sfn|Cooke|2004|p=16}} \n\nParliament responded to the King's charge of treason by stating that Hotham had only been following their orders, and that the King had breached Parliamentary privilege by branding Hotham a traitor.{{sfn|Scott|2008}} This declaration from Parliament brought Hotham to national attention; as was typical during the civil war, Parliament celebrated its victory over the King by [[Pamphlet wars|publishing propaganda]]. A speech made by Hotham on 23 May, in which he justified his actions in defying Charles, was published in [[pamphlet]] form, and for a time those that favoured Parliament were known as 'Hothamites'. In response, a picture was published suggesting that Hotham felt he was superior to the King: Parliament ordered the picture to be ceremonially burned.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=12}}\n\nHotham was worried about the prospect of unrest and rebellion within Hull. At the end of April, Parliament announced that should he be killed his son would replace him as governor. To try and prevent desertions, he spread rumours that the King had ordered any soldiers caught outside the city walls to be killed. By the end of May, in response to demands from Hotham that others \"share in his dangers and responsibilities\", Parliament sent [[Sir William Armine, 2nd Baronet|Sir William Airmyn]], [[Sir William Strickland, 1st Baronet|Sir William Strickland]], [[John Alured]], [[Michael Warton (died 1645)|Michael Warton]], [[Henry Darley]] and [[Peregrine Pelham]] to Hull with Captain Hotham.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|pp=12\u201314}} During May, Parliament had also transported the majority of the weapons from Hull on four boats; around three-quarters of what had been housed in the town arrived in London on 30 May.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=267}}\n\n==Siege==\nAfter rebuffing the King in April, Hotham had to put down several plots from within Hull to betray the town.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=14}} In his [[The History of the Rebellion|account of the Civil War]], the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]] suggested that Hotham was meanwhile planning to hand the town over to the King himself.{{sfn|Hopper|2011|p=14}} [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol|Lord Digby]] had been captured by a Parliamentarian ship, but pretended to be a Frenchman who did not speak English. He was taken to Hull, where he met with Hotham and admitted his true identity. Digby tried to persuade Hotham to surrender Hull to the King. The two agreed that if the King approached the town with a sufficient force, then Hotham could make a show of resisting, before honourably surrendering the town.{{sfn|Durston|1995|p=241}} Digby travelled to York, still disguised as a Frenchman, and informed Charles of the plan.{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=187}}\n\n[[File:Sir_John_Meldrum.png|thumb|upright|left|Sir [[John Meldrum]] was sent by Parliament to both assist Hotham, and ensure his loyalty.]]On 3 July,{{sfn|Newman|1998|p=5}} Charles marched from York with 3,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=128}} On arrival, rather than admitting the King as agreed, Hotham held fast against the King's demands to enter. Hull defences had been further improved, and the poorly trained and equipped army the King had brought was insufficient to storm the town. Charles had contemplated trying to blockade Hull, but had been told by [[Thomas Glemham]], a former governor, that the town was so low-lying that surface water was easily accessible, and Parliament's control of the navy meant that it could be easily replenished by sea.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}} Parliament sent further reinforcements (recorded as between 500 and 1,500) which arrived by sea on 10 July, led by Sir [[John Meldrum]].{{sfn|Reckitt|1952|p=59}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}} In addition to supplementing the garrison, Meldrum had been sent by Parliament to command the garrison, as they were growing suspicious of Hotham's loyalty.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}} To make the town more defensible, Hotham ordered the sluice gates be opened, and that the banks of the Humber should be breached to allow the high spring tide to flood the land around the town. He also had buildings beyond the town walls destroyed to remove any cover the King's army could use during an attack; this included the [[Charterhouse, Kingston upon Hull|Carthusian hospital building]] to the north, and the village of Myton to the west.{{sfn|Evans|2017|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThough Parliament controlled the navy, the Royalists did manage to send one ship up the river Humber as far as [[Keyingham]], {{convert|10|miles}} east of Hull, where they offloaded eight artillery guns which they then transported across land to establish a battery on the eastern side of the town. Forts were also established in [[Paull]], [[Hessle]] and on the southern bank of the Humber, in order to fire at ships using the river.{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=129}} The siege of Hull is variously described as commencing from either 10 July or 15 July,{{sfn|Newman|1998|p=5}}{{sfn|Rayner|2004|p=186}} and a sally made by Meldrum is often attributed as the \"first blood\" of the First English Civil War.{{sfn|Carlton|2008}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2000|p=20}} According to [[John Rushworth]], Meldrum attacked the King's forces with 500 men. The Royalist cavalry were not backed up by their infantry, and in the face of the attack retreated towards Beverley. Meldrum's force made chase, killing two and capturing thirty.{{sfn|Rushworth|1721|pp=580\u2013612}} At this early stage of the war, siege warfare in Britain was largely ineffective; methods that had been developed and refined in the European wars were applied without the skill and experience required.{{sfn|Burke|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Charles, having been frustrated in his efforts to capture the town, withdrew from Hull, leaving the Earl of Lindsey in command of his forces.{{sfn|Gaunt|2014|p=62}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}}{{efn|In his histories, David Cooke lists command passing instead to the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]],{{sfn|Cooke|2004|p=18}}{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=132}} but the majority of sources list it being given to Lindsey.}} Another sortie by Meldrum on 27 July attacked the Royalist arsenal in [[Anlaby]], to the west of Hull,{{sfn|Evans|2017|p=129}} capturing fifteen cannons and a {{convert|36|lb}} mortar.{{sfn|Carlton|2008}} After this loss, the Royalists lifted the siege and retreated to York.{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=268}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nLess than four weeks after retreating from Hull, on 22 August 1642, Charles I raised his [[Royal standards of England|royal standard]] at [[Nottingham]]. He declared the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the formal start of the First English Civil War.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} Securing Hull and its arsenal ensured the Parliamentarian army began the war better equipped than their opponents, and is viewed by historian IE Ryder as \"one of the pivotal actions\" for the first year of the conflict.{{sfn|Ryder|1989|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nIn September 1642, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]] signed a non-aggression pact with local Royalists in an attempt to maintain peace in Yorkshire. Hotham disagreed with the move, and after making strong declarations against the pact, he broke it by attacking [[Selby]] and [[Cawood Castle]] in early October, after which the Royalists retaliated by attacking Fairfax's headquarters in [[Bradford]].{{sfn|Hopper|2011|pp=14\u201315}} Hotham's doubts about defying the King remained: fuelled by his disagreements with Fairfax, Hotham tried to negotiation a defection with the Earl of Newcastle.{{sfn|Scott|2008}} Captain Hotham was arrested for disloyalty by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in June 1643 but managed to escape. Concerned that both father and son were going to defect, Parliament ordered [[Matthew Boynton]] to take control of Hull, which he did on 29 June. Hotham escaped to Beverley, where he was captured and taken to London. Both Hothams were sent to the Tower of London as prisoners, tried and sentenced to death. Despite reprieves and a vote in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], they were executed at the end of January 1645.{{sfn|Scott|2008}}\n\nDuring 1642, the Parliamentarians had the upper hand in the East Riding of Yorkshire, but they suffered territorial losses early the following year, and by June they only held a few towns in the area, including Hull. In August, a Royalist army of 16,000 men commanded by the Earl of Newcastle captured Beverley, forcing Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]], the son of Lord Fairfax, to retreat to Hull. The town was [[Siege of Hull (1643)|besieged for the second time]] in the war between 2 September and 12 October. Newcastle bombarded Hull from a series of siege forts armed with eighteen artillery guns. Although the town suffered heavy damage from the attacks, it was once again able to be replenished by sea, and in early October Parliamentarian sallies damaged or captured some of the siege forts. Along with a Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Winceby]], this led Newcastle to lift the siege and retreat to York.{{sfn|Evans|2017|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/yorks/east/vol1/pp90-171 |chapter=Hull in the 16th and 17th centuries |title=A History of the County of York East Riding: Volume 1, the City of Kingston Upon Hull |editor-last=Allison |editor-first=K.

Born to [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jewish]] immigrants, he spent much of his youth abroad, returning in the 1910s to set up business as an importer of [[Sheet metal|sheet iron]], greatly expanding his father's fortune after [[World War I]]. Auschnitt was caretaker, and from 1929 managing director, of the [[Re\u0219i\u021ba works|Iron Domains and Factory]] (UDR) of [[Re\u0219i\u021ba]], as well as founder of [[C\u0103lan steel works|Titan-N\u0103drag-C\u0103lan]] (TNC), regional partner of [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], and investor in many other fields. Primarily known as the \"iron king\" of [[Greater Romania]], he had a business connection, and later a consuming rivalry, with manufacturer [[Nicolae Malaxa]]. The two were associate owners of [[Creditanstalt]], which established their presence in Europe.\n\nFirst elected to the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] as an independent corporate member, Auschnitt turned to partisan politics as a financial backer of the [[National Peasants' Party]]; he had enduring collaborations with [[Virgil Madgearu]] and [[Dem I. Dobrescu]]. In tandem, he joined a ''[[camarilla]]'' formed around [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], constantly bribing him and his mistress, [[Elena Lupescu]]. Such behavior drew negative attention to his businesses, particularly since Auschnitt used his political connections to secure Romanian state contracts, on which his fortune largely rested. His alleged corruption, along with his ethnicity and his publicized [[anti-fascism]], made him a target for verbal and physical attacks by the far-right movements, in particular the [[Iron Guard]]. Auschnitt attempted to diffuse this threat by paying public tributes to [[Romanian nationalism]] and, more discreetly, by sponsoring the Guardist network. His 1935 marriage to [[Augustin Pordea]]'s daughter, and his conversion to [[Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]], elicited additional controversy.\n\nAuschnitt found himself at odds with Carol after a string of matrimonial, economic, and geopolitical disputes. Marginalized by the passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial 7aws]] in 1937, he was further maligned when Carol's [[National Renaissance Front]] pursued a rapprochement with [[Nazi Germany]]. He was arrested shortly after the start of [[World War II]], and imprisoned following a [[show trial]]. In the process, he lost his UDR shares, which went to Malaxa and [[Albert G\u00f6ring]], and then his citizenship. Carol himself fell from power in 1940, with [[Ion Antonescu]] replacing him as dictator. Despite being antisemitic, this new regime bargained over TNC shares, and finally cleared Auschnitt of all charges in 1942. Once freed, he turned to sponsoring opposition groups, and was also involved in helping fellow Jews to escape the [[Holocaust]]. He had a minor role in plotting the [[King Michael's Coup|anti-fascist coup of 1944]], though he himself had to flee Romania before the event, and was [[Capital punishment in Romania|sentenced to death]] ''[[in absentia]]''. Returning to assist the [[Allied Commission]], he was slowly pushed back into exile by signs that the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was establishing a new dictatorship.\n\nThe new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] again withdrew Auschnitt's citizenship, before pronouncing him guilty of treason. This charge referred to Auschnitt's involvement with [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anti-communist resistance groups]], including his allegedly financing [[Nicolae Petra\u0219cu (Iron Guard)|Nicolae Petra\u0219cu]]'s Iron Guard cells. Stripped of his Romanian properties, Auschnitt relaunched himself as an entrepreneur in the [[plastics industry]], and obtained American citizenship. His final political activities were as a sponsor of the [[Romanian National Committee]], which split into pro-Auschnitt and pro-Malaxa factions, respectively led by [[Constantin Vi\u0219oianu]] and [[Nicolae R\u0103descu]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Beginnings===\nAuschnitt was the scion of [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jewish]] immigrants,<ref name=\"rdclande\">Romulus Damian, \"Cet\u0103\u021benii no\u0219tri clandestini\", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Issue 97/1939, p. 4</ref><ref name=\"ddfiul\">{{in lang|ro}} Dani Dancea, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140722230751/https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/fiul-marelui-industrias-max-ausnit-primit-cheia-orasului-construit-cea-mai-moderna-parcare-camioane-romania-1_53c913460d133766a88b5744/index.html \"Fiul marelui industria\u0219 Max Au\u0219nit a primit cheia ora\u0219ului \u00een care a construit cea mai modern\u0103 parcare de camioane din Rom\u00e2nia\"], in ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'' (Timi\u0219oara edition), July 18, 2014</ref> though he may have claimed [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] ancestry.<ref>Keene, p. 223</ref> A hostile piece by journalist Romulus Damian claims that the Auschnitts, including Max's father Olias, his mother Clara, and his elder brother Edgar, had illegally crossed into the [[Romanian Kingdom]] from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and then bribed the authorities into obtaining citizenship.<ref name=\"rdclande\"/> Known in early records as \"Osias Ausschnitt\", Max's father had a background in the iron trade.

[[Nicolae Malaxa]] is showing Carol assembly-line products; Auschnitt is present at the far-left of the image]]\nIn February 1938, Auschnitt announced that he was giving up on politics and moving abroad, sparking alarm that he was going to create chaos by also giving up on his managerial duties. As he explained at the time, he only pondered exile because of Goga's [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial laws]], which were specifically targeted at Jews.<ref name=\"cesoir\"/> Only days after, Carol II staged a [[self-coup]], outlawing all political parties and replacing them with the [[National Renaissance Front]]; the antisemitic legislation, passed in 1937, was tightened and extended. This regime also formalized Carol's growing disdain for Auschnitt, which reportedly began when Livia refused Carol's sexual advances,<ref name=\"rey\"/> or when Lupescu grew jealous that she would not.<ref name=\"cesoir\"/><ref name=\"trdzmata\">Toma Roman Jr, [[Dinu Zamfirescu]], \"Mata Hari a Rom\u00e2niei\", in ''[[Jurnalul Na\u021bional]]'', August 8, 2008</ref> Auschnitt himself was notoriously unfaithful to his wife, spending his money on sexual escapades in Vienna.<ref name=\"cesoir\"/>\n\nFrom March 1939, Carol directed Romania's political and economic rapprochement with [[Nazi Germany]]. While celebrated by Malaxa, this move alienated Auschnitt, who feared [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]]. His memorandum on the matter reached Carol and Madgearu, but had no success.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> In July, Carol shelved the plan for an Anglo\u2013Franco\u2013Romanian joint venture, reportedly objecting that its two would-be managers, Auschnitt and Oskar Kaufmann, were Jewish.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 24</ref> Later that month, Orghidan, who was seen as \"Auschnit's man\", was voted off the UDR board.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/><ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 36\u201337</ref> Soon after this, Auschnitt was no longer invited to Lupescu's poker evenings.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> On August 18, he resigned from the UDR, citing no explicit reason.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 72</ref> The pretext was offered by his alleged conflict of interest: Auschnitt was claimed to have tampered with a signed UDR contract in order to obtain state compensation for TNC budgetary losses.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/><ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 72, 89\u201390, 104\u2013106</ref> Auschnitt is cited by Argetoianu as emotionally shaken by the interpretation of facts, openly denying that the document in question was ever modified.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> The diarist notes that Urd\u0103reanu, who \"has a nose for these things\", had come to openly disrespect Auschnitt long before heading the investigation at Re\u0219i\u021ba.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 72</ref> This issue is attested in other records, which, Scurtu notes, show Urd\u0103reanu constantly engaged in undermining Auschnitt's reputation.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/>\n\nCommenting on Auschnitt's character in his own diary, Carol surmises: \"A Yid is still a Yid, no matter how nice he might be as a man.\"<ref>[[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]], ''Inventing the Jew.

Lincoln: [[University of Nebraska Press]], 2009.  {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2098-0}}</ref> Urd\u0103reanu allegedly concluded that Auschnitt had also \"clogged\" the UDR with Jews and [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], and insisted that this was additional proof of malfeasance.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 104\u2013105</ref> Argetoianu additionally reports that both Auschnitt and Kaufmann had by then been involved in [[insider trading]] at the Credit Bank, from which they drew a profit of 6 million lei between them. Their momentary success was offset by Edgar Auschnitt, who lost 3 million lei playing [[backgammon]] against [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]].<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 26, 86</ref>\n\n===First trial===\nEconomist [[Kurt Lachmann]] places blame for Auschnitt's ouster on the \"antisemitic campaign in Rumania, financed by the Nazis.\"<ref>Lachmann, p. 34</ref> In Germany, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' openly celebrated the Auschnitts' downfall.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 86</ref> Auschnitt's opposition to Nazi policies entered a new stage in March 1939, just before the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] renewed their commitment to defending [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] from Nazi encroachment. Historian R. P. T. Davenport-Hines suggests that Auschnitt may have been responsible for strengthening the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]] in that he circulated an alarmist claim, namely that Germany had issued an ultimatum for Romania to join the [[Axis Powers|Axis]].<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 275</ref> In September, during the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi invasion of Poland]], Auschnitt retaliated against the Nazis by assisting [[Romanian Bridgehead|Polish refugees]].<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 136</ref> \n\nIn October, the king allowed Iamandi to draft new regulations for ''[[S.A. (corporation)|soci\u00e9t\u00e9s anonymes]]'', specifically designed to harm Auschnitt; the latter was being interrogated by prosecutors regarding his UDR contracts.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 170\u2013171, 185, 190</ref> Business rivals where then allowed to engineer a trial against Auschnitt, who was accused of fraud and [[money laundering]]. Various observers believed that he was no longer willing to share his profits with the ''camarilla'', which made him a target for retribution.<ref name=\"hdecon\"/> Argetoianu adds speculation that Carol was resentful because his stocks in the Lujani sugar refineries, obtained from Auschnitt, had been subject to litigation; or that the king intended to please [[Adolf Hitler]] by \"sacrificing his own kikes\".<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 89</ref> The interpretation is partly backed by sociologist Mictat G\u00e2rlan, according to whom \"Max Auschnitt, a man close to the Royal House\", was arrested \"only because he was Jewish.\"<ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref> The disgraced courtier kept in his desk a document showing that Carol was fully responsible for the sugar debacle.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 120</ref>\n\nA \"public enemy number 1\",<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 171</ref> Auschnitt was also expected to relinquish his UDR shares. According to one account, he agreed to sell only if he was guaranteed immunity from prosecution and allowed to settle in France, where Livia had already relocated. A deal was reached, but Auschnitt was still arrested on the border.<ref name=\"rey\"/> Argetoianu partly backs this rumor, by relaying a story allegedly told by Iamandi, according to which Auschnitt agreed to cede his stock if promised immunity from prosecution. His proposal, Argetoianu notes, was simply denied.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 220\u2013221</ref> Though selected by Carol to serve as Prime Minister during the same interval, Argetoianu still viewed the affair as a settling of scores, and asked not to be involved on either side.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 218</ref> On November 8, as Auschnitt was taken to [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti prison]], Argetoianu read his grounds for indictment and concluded that his friend was not in fact innocent, though the trial he faced was likely to be unfair.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 208</ref> \n\nThe matter was personally handled by [[Gavril\u0103 Marinescu]], who was Argetoianu's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Internal Affairs]]. He cited his \"moral debt\" to Auschnitt in an attempt to recuse himself, but Carol insisted that he pursue the investigation, noting that Auschnitt was symptomatic for a \"corrupt system\", and that a [[show trial]] would commence \"the purge\" of Romanian industry.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> On November 14, the authorities raided TNC offices, arresting general manager Constantin Naghi and four other directors who, they claimed, were \"controlled by Au\u0219nit\". They also detained an unnamed witness, whose testimony allowed them to recover 10 million [[French franc]]s that Auschnitt had deposited with a former in-law, Aronovici.<ref name=\"detidos\"/> Prosecutors also looked into another issue of conflicting interests, noting that Auschnitt had used CEPI to buy off UDR assets.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/>\n\nOn December 9, a new cabinet, headed by [[Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu]], stripped Max and Edgar Auschnitt of their Romanian citizenship.<ref name=\"rdclande\"/><ref name=\"liquid\">[http://pdfs.jta.org/1940/1940-04-01_198.pdf \"Rumania Liquidating the Property of Edgar Ausnit, Brother of Jailed Arms Magnate\"], in the ''News from All Over the World. By the Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', Vol. VI, Issue 198, April 1940, p. 5</ref> Edgar had by then escaped to London, which allowed government to confiscate and redistribute his assets in Romania;<ref name=\"liquid\"/> Livia, meanwhile, was spotted on the [[French Riviera]], allegedly pursuing an affair with Kurt von Haugwitz-Reventlow.<ref>[[Walter Winchell]], \"On Broadway\", in ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal|The Spartanburg Herald]]'', March 20, 1940, p. 4</ref> Argetoianu assesses that Auschnitt's imprisonment had by then brought a great surge in the king's popularity, since the public, especially the \"nationalist and antisemitic circles\", could now believe that the tide was turning on his ''camarilla''.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 208, 212, 218</ref> He comments on demonstrative gestures by the authorities, which included forcing Auschnitt into the regular [[police van]].<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 208, 214</ref> Argetoianu also writes that \"[[Philo-Semitism|philosemites]]\" were baffled by Carol's clampdown, and exaggerated its meaning. He illustrates this with a quote from General [[Eugeniu V\u00e2rtejanu]], who was reportedly Auschnitt's friend: \"This is the [[Dreyfus affair]] in its Romanian version\".<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 218</ref> \n\nDespite his subjects' enthusiasm, the king never agreed to have other ''camarilla'' men prosecuted for their alleged misdeeds. As noted by researcher George Enache, the affair showed the power that of Romanian secret services had in influencing legal procedures, especially so since Malaxa, whose name had been cited in similar allegations, was never convicted.<ref>Enache, p. 179</ref> In February 1940, an I. D. Dumitrescu publicized a full record of illegal deals involving Malaxa (who had left the country on an extended leave), but Carol ordered Marinescu not to follow up on this lead.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> On March 14, Auschnitt was sentenced to a six-year term in labor camps, and ordered to pay back 200 million lei<ref>B\u00e9k\u00e9s ''et al.'', p. 96</ref> (approximately 140,000 [[British pound]]s in 2016 rates).<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> In June, while filing his appeal from [[Doftana prison]], he made a final attempt at placating the ''camarilla'', offering to split his UDR shares between CEPI and Malaxa's companies.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/><ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref> This message failed to impress. His UDR stock was confiscated without him being involved. Auschnitt's shares were reportedly split between the [[Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring|Nazi iron conglomerate]] and Malaxa.<ref name=\"rcnixon\"/> According to Lachmann, [[Albert G\u00f6ring]] \"terrorized the Rumanian government\" into issuing more shares that his firm then acquired.<ref>Lachmann, p. 34</ref>\n\n===Antonescu years===\nIn September 1940, following public outrage over the [[Second Vienna Award]], Carol was deposed and exiled, alongside his mistress; the \"[[National Legionary State]]\" was established as a partnership between the Iron Guard and General [[Ion Antonescu]]. The Guard opened up Lupescu's residence, reportedly showing that she still kept Livia Auschnitt's portrait.<ref>I. M., \"Casa Elenei Lupescu\", in ''Ardealul'', October 20, 1940, p. 1</ref> Antonescu was lenient toward her husband, dispatching him to a sanitarium,<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> but also continued to enforce and enhance antisemitic laws. Such policies remained unchanged when the Guard was [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|ousted in January 1941]], as Romania remained closely aligned with Germany. In December 1941, Antonescu noted of Auschnitt: \"once a kike, always a kike\".<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> He openly acknowledged that Auschnitt was in fact innocent of any crime, and favored allowing him to leave Romania if he would transfer all his property to the state; this attempt was foiled by protests from [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]].<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> Despite further outrage from such circles, Antonescu's courts commuted Auschnitt's sentence into forced labor at the TNC, meaning that he was effectively on parole.<ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref>\n\nIn October 1941, Auschnitt offered to donate his share of the TNC to a state company. His proposal caused much embarrassment for Antonescu's ministers, since accepting under the circumstances would have looked like their blackmailing a prisoner.<ref name=\"csdona\u021bie\">{{in lang|ro}} Ciprian Stoleru, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190828034818/https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/guvernul-antonescu-pus-in-dificultate-de-o-donatiei-a-lui-max-auschnitt \"Guvernul Antonescu, pus \u00een dificultate de o dona\u021bie a lui Max Auschnitt\"], in ''Historia'', March 2012</ref> Antonescu himself intervened to chide Orghidan and [[Alexandru Ottulescu]] for stalling. In January 1942, Auschnitt sorted the issue by appointing Orghidan as caretaker of his estate, which allowed for TNC stock to be issued and bought by the state using Auschnitt's money.<ref name=\"csdona\u021bie\"/> In May 1943, the UDR, managed at the time by G\u00f6ring and physicist [[Horia Hulubei]], reported capital gains of 37.8 million lei obtained from the Auschnitt and CEPI transactions.<ref>\"Anun\u021buri comerciale\", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', May 8, 1943, pp. 2889\u20132890</ref> Meanwhile, operating through the Cisatlantic and Cisoceanic consortia, Edgar was able to purchase an interest in the Romanian munitions manufacturer, IRMC.<ref name=\"forge\">L.

Here, a forge equipment he had ordered in 1939 was confiscated by the [[Office of Alien Property Custodian]], and made available for use by the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=\"forge\"/>\n\nEventually, Antonescu's review of previous court verdicts reached Auschnitt's case. Unusually for a Jew in that context, he was cleared of the charges and released on July 3, 1942.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> Around that time, Auschnitt managed to transfer money from his accounts with the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] to a cell of anti-fascist exiles in England, which was overseen by [[Grigore Gafencu]]. This stipend of 6,000 British pounds was Gafencu's main source of revenue in 1943.<ref>Marian Zidaru, \"SOE \u00een Rom\u00e2nia \u00een al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial.

In May 1943, the genocidal ''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Adolf Eichmann]] was working on the case, insisting that Nazi spies were to prevent Auschnitt from leaving Romania.<ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref> During the early months of 1944, Auschnitt was reportedly allowed access into the Ministry of National Economy, alongside Orghidan.

Also to these sources, the effort was coordinated by American envoys.<ref>Mandache, pp. 41, 101</ref> Alexandru Grigoriu, himself an industrialist and a Mason, noted that Auschnitt personally handled grants for Titel Petrescu and [[Anton Dumitriu]], who had by then formed an Independent Social Democratic Party.<ref>Mandache, p. 101</ref>\n\nWorking as a diplomat, Gustave Pordea sensed the changing of fortunes, and opted to defect in 1947.<ref name=\"rcgine\"/> According to historian [[Dinu Zamfirescu]], the Pordeas were actually protected by Groza, who allowed both Gustave and Livia safe passage when their father promised to donate all his assets to the Romanian state. Gustave was sent to an \"obscure post\" in [[The Hague]] precisely because he could then escape, together with his \"many children\".<ref name=\"trdzmata\"/> Sources differ as to where his brother-in-law was living at the time. A report by the Soviet spy S. Pivovarov, issued in June 1947, claims that Auschnitt \"has been in the US for over a year\", and that, with Malaxa, he was attempting to channel American funding for Romania's industrial effort.<ref>Tatiana A.

As such, he was briefly detained in 1947.<ref name=\"roske\"/> Schuyler finally warned him that his life was in danger, prompting Auschnitt to relocate in France<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 12</ref> at some point before August 15, 1947.<ref>Constantin, p. 51</ref> \n\nRecords kept by the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] suggest that Auschnitt, like Malaxa, successfully persuaded communist ministers to let him leave for the United States as a negotiator of trade deals. The allegation was stated by [[Ana Pauker]], who represented the PCR's [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] circles, against [[National communism in Romania|national-communists]] such as [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]; she implied that Auschnitt had won them over with his patriotic rhetoric.<ref name=\"f\u0219malaxa\"/><ref>Constantin, pp. 51\u201352</ref> Pauker's faction believed that [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]] was particularly at fault for the gaffe.<ref>Constantin, pp. 51\u201352</ref> In August 1948, Auschnitt was included on a list of exiles who were stripped of their Romanian citizenship\u2014alongside Lupescu, Mociorni\u021ba, [[Ioan Pangal]], [[Ion S\u00e2n-Giorgiu]], and some others.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [https://www.rum\u00e4nische-bibliothek.de/resources/bire/1948/22/File0052.PDF \"Les emigr\u00e9s dechus de la nationalit\u00e9 roumaine\"], in ''B.I.R.E.

After negotiations overseen by the exiled king [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]], the two wings reached an agreement in May 1949, but again quarreled and split up in December 1950.<ref name=\"eh51\"/> During the subsequent row, R\u0103descu opened a civil lawsuit against members of Michael's retinue, alleging that, on Auschnitt's orders, they had dilapidated 3 million Swiss francs from the RNC's pool.<ref>Andrei Lucaci, \"Exilul rom\u00e2nesc dup\u0103 al II-lea r\u0103zboi mondial\", in ''Carpica'', Vol. XXXII, 2003, p. 212</ref> In parallel, the RNC successfully called in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to examine Nixon's deals with Malaxa, until [[Walter Bedell Smith]] ordered his agents to step down.<ref>Constantin, p. 53</ref>\n\nThe dispute was closely followed by Romania's new secret police, the [[Securitate]].

Born to [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jewish]] immigrants, he spent much of his youth abroad, returning in the 1910s to set up business as an importer of [[Sheet metal|sheet iron]], greatly expanding his father's fortune after [[World War I]]. Auschnitt was caretaker, and from 1929 managing director, of the [[Re\u0219i\u021ba works|Iron Domains and Factory]] (UDR) of [[Re\u0219i\u021ba]], as well as founder of [[C\u0103lan steel works|Titan-N\u0103drag-C\u0103lan]] (TNC), regional partner of [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], and investor in many other fields. Primarily known as the \"iron king\" of [[Greater Romania]], he had a business connection, and later a consuming rivalry, with manufacturer [[Nicolae Malaxa]]. The two were associate owners of [[Creditanstalt]], which established their presence in Europe.\n\nFirst elected to the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] as an independent corporate member, Auschnitt turned to partisan politics as a financial backer of the [[National Peasants' Party]]; he had enduring collaborations with [[Virgil Madgearu]] and [[Dem I. Dobrescu]]. In tandem, he joined a ''[[camarilla]]'' formed around [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], constantly bribing him and his mistress, [[Elena Lupescu]]. Such behavior drew negative attention to his businesses, particularly since Auschnitt used his political connections to secure Romanian state contracts, on which his fortune largely rested. His alleged corruption, along with his ethnicity and his publicized [[anti-fascism]], made him a target for verbal and physical attacks by the far-right movements, in particular the [[Iron Guard]]. Auschnitt attempted to diffuse this threat by paying public tributes to [[Romanian nationalism]] and, more discreetly, by sponsoring the Guardist network. His 1935 marriage to [[Augustin Pordea]]'s daughter, and his conversion to [[Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]], elicited additional controversy.\n\nAuschnitt found himself at odds with Carol after a string of matrimonial, economic, and geopolitical disputes. Marginalized by the passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial 7aws]] in 1937, he was further maligned when Carol's [[National Renaissance Front]] pursued a rapprochement with [[Nazi Germany]]. He was arrested shortly after the start of [[World War II]], and imprisoned following a [[show trial]]. In the process, he lost his UDR shares, which went to Malaxa and [[Albert G\u00f6ring]], and then his citizenship. Carol himself fell from power in 1940, with [[Ion Antonescu]] replacing him as dictator. Despite being antisemitic, this new regime bargained over TNC shares, and finally cleared Auschnitt of all charges in 1942. Once freed, he turned to sponsoring opposition groups, and was also involved in helping fellow Jews to escape the [[Holocaust]]. He had a minor role in plotting the [[King Michael's Coup|anti-fascist coup of 1944]], though he himself had to flee Romania before the event, and was [[Capital punishment in Romania|sentenced to death]] ''[[in absentia]]''. Returning to assist the [[Allied Commission]], he was slowly pushed back into exile by signs that the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was establishing a new dictatorship.\n\nThe new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] again withdrew Auschnitt's citizenship, before pronouncing him guilty of treason. This charge referred to Auschnitt's involvement with [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|anti-communist resistance groups]], including his allegedly financing [[Nicolae Petra\u0219cu (Iron Guard)|Nicolae Petra\u0219cu]]'s Iron Guard cells. Stripped of his Romanian properties, Auschnitt relaunched himself as an entrepreneur in the [[plastics industry]], and obtained American citizenship. His final political activities were as a sponsor of the [[Romanian National Committee]], which split into pro-Auschnitt and pro-Malaxa factions, respectively led by [[Constantin Vi\u0219oianu]] and [[Nicolae R\u0103descu]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Beginnings===\nAuschnitt was the scion of [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jewish]] immigrants,<ref name=\"rdclande\">Romulus Damian, \"Cet\u0103\u021benii no\u0219tri clandestini\", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Issue 97/1939, p. 4</ref><ref name=\"ddfiul\">{{in lang|ro}} Dani Dancea, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140722230751/https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/fiul-marelui-industrias-max-ausnit-primit-cheia-orasului-construit-cea-mai-moderna-parcare-camioane-romania-1_53c913460d133766a88b5744/index.html \"Fiul marelui industria\u0219 Max Au\u0219nit a primit cheia ora\u0219ului \u00een care a construit cea mai modern\u0103 parcare de camioane din Rom\u00e2nia\"], in ''[[Adev\u0103rul]]'' (Timi\u0219oara edition), July 18, 2014</ref> though he may have claimed [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] ancestry.<ref>Keene, p. 223</ref> A hostile piece by journalist Romulus Damian claims that the Auschnitts, including Max's father Olias, his mother Clara, and his elder brother Edgar, had illegally crossed into the [[Romanian Kingdom]] from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and then bribed the authorities into obtaining citizenship.<ref name=\"rdclande\"/> Known in early records as \"Osias Ausschnitt\", Max's father had a background in the iron trade.

His memorandum on the matter reached Carol and Madgearu, but had no success.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> In July, Carol shelved the plan for an Anglo\u2013Franco\u2013Romanian joint venture, reportedly objecting that its two would-be managers, Auschnitt and Oskar Kaufmann, were Jewish.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 24</ref> Later that month, Orghidan, who was seen as \"Auschnit's man\", was voted off the UDR board.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/><ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 36\u201337</ref> Soon after this, Auschnitt was no longer invited to Lupescu's poker evenings.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> On August 18, he resigned from the UDR, citing no explicit reason.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 72</ref> The pretext was offered by his alleged conflict of interest: Auschnitt was claimed to have tampered with a signed UDR contract in order to obtain state compensation for TNC budgetary losses.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/><ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 72, 89\u201390, 104\u2013106</ref> Auschnitt is cited by Argetoianu as emotionally shaken by the interpretation of facts, openly denying that the document in question was ever modified.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> The diarist notes that Urd\u0103reanu, who \"has a nose for these things\", had come to openly disrespect Auschnitt long before heading the investigation at Re\u0219i\u021ba.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 72</ref> This issue is attested in other records, which, Scurtu notes, show Urd\u0103reanu constantly engaged in undermining Auschnitt's reputation.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/>\n\nCommenting on Auschnitt's character in his own diary, Carol surmises: \"A Yid is still a Yid, no matter how nice he might be as a man.\"<ref>[[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]], ''Inventing the Jew.

Their momentary success was offset by Edgar Auschnitt, who lost 3 million lei playing [[backgammon]] against [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]].<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 26, 86</ref>\n\n===First trial===\nEconomist [[Kurt Lachmann]] places blame for Auschnitt's ouster on the \"antisemitic campaign in Rumania, financed by the Nazis.\"<ref>Lachmann, p. 34</ref> In Germany, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' openly celebrated the Auschnitts' downfall.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 86</ref> Auschnitt's opposition to Nazi policies entered a new stage in March 1939, just before the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] renewed their commitment to defending [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] from Nazi encroachment. Historian R. P. T. Davenport-Hines suggests that Auschnitt may have been responsible for strengthening the [[Anglo-Polish military alliance]] in that he circulated an alarmist claim, namely that Germany had issued an ultimatum for Romania to join the [[Axis Powers|Axis]].<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 275</ref> In September, during the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi invasion of Poland]], Auschnitt retaliated against the Nazis by assisting [[Romanian Bridgehead|Polish refugees]].<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 136</ref> \n\nIn October, the king allowed Iamandi to draft new regulations for ''[[S.A. (corporation)|soci\u00e9t\u00e9s anonymes]]'', specifically designed to harm Auschnitt; the latter was being interrogated by prosecutors regarding his UDR contracts.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 170\u2013171, 185, 190</ref> Business rivals where then allowed to engineer a trial against Auschnitt, who was accused of fraud and [[money laundering]]. Various observers believed that he was no longer willing to share his profits with the ''camarilla'', which made him a target for retribution.<ref name=\"hdecon\"/> Argetoianu adds speculation that Carol was resentful because his stocks in the Lujani sugar refineries, obtained from Auschnitt, had been subject to litigation; or that the king intended to please [[Adolf Hitler]] by \"sacrificing his own kikes\".<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 89</ref> The interpretation is partly backed by sociologist Mictat G\u00e2rlan, according to whom \"Max Auschnitt, a man close to the Royal House\", was arrested \"only because he was Jewish.\"<ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref> The disgraced courtier kept in his desk a document showing that Carol was fully responsible for the sugar debacle.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 120</ref>\n\nA \"public enemy number 1\",<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 171</ref> Auschnitt was also expected to relinquish his UDR shares. According to one account, he agreed to sell only if he was guaranteed immunity from prosecution and allowed to settle in France, where Livia had already relocated. A deal was reached, but Auschnitt was still arrested on the border.<ref name=\"rey\"/> Argetoianu partly backs this rumor, by relaying a story allegedly told by Iamandi, according to which Auschnitt agreed to cede his stock if promised immunity from prosecution. His proposal, Argetoianu notes, was simply denied.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 220\u2013221</ref> Though selected by Carol to serve as Prime Minister during the same interval, Argetoianu still viewed the affair as a settling of scores, and asked not to be involved on either side.<ref>Argetoianu VII, pp. 218</ref> On November 8, as Auschnitt was taken to [[V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti prison]], Argetoianu read his grounds for indictment and concluded that his friend was not in fact innocent, though the trial he faced was likely to be unfair.<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 208</ref> \n\nThe matter was personally handled by [[Gavril\u0103 Marinescu]], who was Argetoianu's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Internal Affairs]]. He cited his \"moral debt\" to Auschnitt in an attempt to recuse himself, but Carol insisted that he pursue the investigation, noting that Auschnitt was symptomatic for a \"corrupt system\", and that a [[show trial]] would commence \"the purge\" of Romanian industry.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> On November 14, the authorities raided TNC offices, arresting general manager Constantin Naghi and four other directors who, they claimed, were \"controlled by Au\u0219nit\". They also detained an unnamed witness, whose testimony allowed them to recover 10 million [[French franc]]s that Auschnitt had deposited with a former in-law, Aronovici.<ref name=\"detidos\"/> Prosecutors also looked into another issue of conflicting interests, noting that Auschnitt had used CEPI to buy off UDR assets.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/>\n\nOn December 9, a new cabinet, headed by [[Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu]], stripped Max and Edgar Auschnitt of their Romanian citizenship.<ref name=\"rdclande\"/><ref name=\"liquid\">[http://pdfs.jta.org/1940/1940-04-01_198.pdf \"Rumania Liquidating the Property of Edgar Ausnit, Brother of Jailed Arms Magnate\"], in the ''News from All Over the World.

He illustrates this with a quote from General [[Eugeniu V\u00e2rtejanu]], who was reportedly Auschnitt's friend: \"This is the [[Dreyfus affair]] in its Romanian version\".<ref>Argetoianu VII, p. 218</ref> \n\nDespite his subjects' enthusiasm, the king never agreed to have other ''camarilla'' men prosecuted for their alleged misdeeds. As noted by researcher George Enache, the affair showed the power that of Romanian secret services had in influencing legal procedures, especially so since Malaxa, whose name had been cited in similar allegations, was never convicted.<ref>Enache, p. 179</ref> In February 1940, an I. D. Dumitrescu publicized a full record of illegal deals involving Malaxa (who had left the country on an extended leave), but Carol ordered Marinescu not to follow up on this lead.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> On March 14, Auschnitt was sentenced to a six-year term in labor camps, and ordered to pay back 200 million lei<ref>B\u00e9k\u00e9s ''et al.'', p. 96</ref> (approximately 140,000 [[British pound]]s in 2016 rates).<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> In June, while filing his appeal from [[Doftana prison]], he made a final attempt at placating the ''camarilla'', offering to split his UDR shares between CEPI and Malaxa's companies.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/><ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref> This message failed to impress. His UDR stock was confiscated without him being involved. Auschnitt's shares were reportedly split between the [[Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring|Nazi iron conglomerate]] and Malaxa.<ref name=\"rcnixon\"/> According to Lachmann, [[Albert G\u00f6ring]] \"terrorized the Rumanian government\" into issuing more shares that his firm then acquired.<ref>Lachmann, p. 34</ref>\n\n===Antonescu years===\nIn September 1940, following public outrage over the [[Second Vienna Award]], Carol was deposed and exiled, alongside his mistress; the \"[[National Legionary State]]\" was established as a partnership between the Iron Guard and General [[Ion Antonescu]]. The Guard opened up Lupescu's residence, reportedly showing that she still kept Livia Auschnitt's portrait.<ref>I. M., \"Casa Elenei Lupescu\", in ''Ardealul'', October 20, 1940, p. 1</ref> Antonescu was lenient toward her husband, dispatching him to a sanitarium,<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> but also continued to enforce and enhance antisemitic laws. Such policies remained unchanged when the Guard was [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|ousted in January 1941]], as Romania remained closely aligned with Germany. In December 1941, Antonescu noted of Auschnitt: \"once a kike, always a kike\".<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> He openly acknowledged that Auschnitt was in fact innocent of any crime, and favored allowing him to leave Romania if he would transfer all his property to the state; this attempt was foiled by protests from [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Foreign Minister]].<ref>Wallersteiner, p. 11</ref> Despite further outrage from such circles, Antonescu's courts commuted Auschnitt's sentence into forced labor at the TNC, meaning that he was effectively on parole.<ref>G\u00e2rlan, p. 8</ref>\n\nIn October 1941, Auschnitt offered to donate his share of the TNC to a state company. His proposal caused much embarrassment for Antonescu's ministers, since accepting under the circumstances would have looked like their blackmailing a prisoner.<ref name=\"csdona\u021bie\">{{in lang|ro}} Ciprian Stoleru, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190828034818/https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/guvernul-antonescu-pus-in-dificultate-de-o-donatiei-a-lui-max-auschnitt \"Guvernul Antonescu, pus \u00een dificultate de o dona\u021bie a lui Max Auschnitt\"], in ''Historia'', March 2012</ref> Antonescu himself intervened to chide Orghidan and [[Alexandru Ottulescu]] for stalling. In January 1942, Auschnitt sorted the issue by appointing Orghidan as caretaker of his estate, which allowed for TNC stock to be issued and bought by the state using Auschnitt's money.<ref name=\"csdona\u021bie\"/> In May 1943, the UDR, managed at the time by G\u00f6ring and physicist [[Horia Hulubei]], reported capital gains of 37.8 million lei obtained from the Auschnitt and CEPI transactions.<ref>\"Anun\u021buri comerciale\", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', May 8, 1943, pp. 2889\u20132890</ref> Meanwhile, operating through the Cisatlantic and Cisoceanic consortia, Edgar was able to purchase an interest in the Romanian munitions manufacturer, IRMC.<ref name=\"forge\">L.

Here, a forge equipment he had ordered in 1939 was confiscated by the [[Office of Alien Property Custodian]], and made available for use by the [[United States Navy]].<ref name=\"forge\"/>\n\nEventually, Antonescu's review of previous court verdicts reached Auschnitt's case. Unusually for a Jew in that context, he was cleared of the charges and released on July 3, 1942.<ref name=\"isnababi\"/> Around that time, Auschnitt managed to transfer money from his accounts with the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] to a cell of anti-fascist exiles in England, which was overseen by [[Grigore Gafencu]]. This stipend of 6,000 British pounds was Gafencu's main source of revenue in 1943.<ref>Marian Zidaru, \"SOE \u00een Rom\u00e2nia \u00een al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial.

The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production and the [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant [[nationalism]], culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a new puppet state, [[Manchukuo]]; many historians cite 1931 as the beginning of the war.<ref name=\"Hotta2007\">{{cite book|last=Hotta|first=E.|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kih_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|date=25 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-60992-1|page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"Paine2012\">{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called \"incidents\".\n\nFollowing the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939\u201340 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive]] in central China.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. The following day the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China by airlifting material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]].\n\nOn August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria]], Japan capitulated to Allied forces.  Japan continued to occupy part of China's territory until it formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]]. The remaining Japanese occupation forces (excluding Manchuria) formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.\n\nAt the outcome of the [[Cairo Conference]] of November 22\u201326, 1943, the Allies of World War II had decided to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan by restoring all the territories that Japan annexed from China, including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Pescadores]], to China, and to expel Japan from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. China was recognized as one of the [[Four Policemen|Big Four of the Allies]] during the war and became one of the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{sfnp|Mitter|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bqc_YkuyaCIC&pg=PA369 369]}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HymSg_Pp7X0C&pg=PA223 |title= The New York Times Living History: World War II, 1942\u20131945: The Allied Counteroffensive|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas |accessdate=1 September 2015|isbn= 9780805072471|year= 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620101548/http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|archive-date=June 20, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], convened between 1946 and 1948, [[Criminal procedure|tried]] and punished the Japanese leaders for waging war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Allied Commander-in-Chief in the China theatre from 1942 to 1945]]\n[[File:WW2 Documentary \u4e8c\u6230\u7d00\u9304\u7247Part 1 of 7.ogg|thumb|left|The beginning of the war]]\n\nIn China, the war is most commonly known as the \"War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh| t=\u6297\u65e5\u6230\u722d| s=\u6297\u65e5\u6218\u4e89}}), and shortened to the \"Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh|\u6297\u65e5}}) or the \"War of Resistance\" ({{zh| s=\u6297\u6218| t=\u6297\u6230|links=no}}).

From the Japanese perspective was that localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively.

For example, the warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] of [[Manchuria]] from the [[Fengtian clique]] openly cooperated with the Japanese for military and economic assistance.<ref name=\"Foreign News: Revenge?-TIME-MAGAZINE\">{{Cite news\n|title=Foreign News: Revenge?\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727322,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=August 13, 1923}}</ref>\n\n===Twenty-One Demands===\nIn 1915, Japan issued the [[Twenty-One Demands]] to extort further political and commercial privilege from China, which was accepted by Yuan Shikai.<ref>Hoyt, Edwin P., Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict, p. 45</ref> Following [[World War I]], Japan acquired the [[German Empire]]'s [[sphere of influence]] in [[Shandong]] province,<ref>Palmer and Colton, A History of Modern World, p. 725</ref> leading to nationwide anti-Japanese [[May Fourth Movement|protests and mass demonstrations]] in China. Under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]], China remained fragmented and was unable to resist foreign incursions.{{sfn|Taylor|page=33}} For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, alternatively known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Taylor|page=57}}\n\n===Jinan incident===\n{{Main|Jinan incident}}\n\nThe [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military violently killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.{{sfn|Taylor|page=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|page=82}}\n\n===Reunification of China (1928)===\n{{Main|Chinese reunification (1928)}}\n\nAs the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] by the Kwantung Army in 1928.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 121</ref> His son, [[Zhang Xueliang]], took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria.

The Soviet [[Red Army]] victory over [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.<ref>Michael M. Walker, ''The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2017), p. 290.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.<ref>Michael M.

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ({{zh|c=\u6518\u5916\u5fc5\u5148\u5b89\u5167|links=no}}).\n\n==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==\n{{anchor|occupation}}\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]\n\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144</ref>\n\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.\n\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]\nIn 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].\n\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=\u83ef\u5317\u7279\u6b8a\u5316|p=hu\u00e1b\u011bit\u00e8sh\u016bh\u00f9a|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].\n\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He\u2013Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u20131936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===\n[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July\u2013August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]] strongly shook public opinion within Japan.\n\n===Battle of Shanghai===\n{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]\n\nThe [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the \"breaking point\" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u20131945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]\n\nOn August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].

These campaigns involved approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese. Historians estimate that between December 13, 1937, and late January 1938, Japanese forces killed an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 Chinese (mostly civilians) in the \"[[Nanjing Massacre]]\" (also known as the \"Rape of Nanjing\"), after [[Battle of Nanjing|its fall]].\n\nIn 2005, a history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform which had been approved by the government in 2001, sparked huge outcry and protests in China and Korea.

They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March\u2013April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were expelled from their homes. About 800,000 drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger.\n\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.\n\n===1939\u201340: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===\n[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\n\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general.

However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\n\n===Japanese expansion===\n[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]\n\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas.

In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: \"the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart\". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.\n\n[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March\u2013April 1938]]\n\nEven under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.\n\nAfterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of \"trading space for time\" ({{zh|s=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6362\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4|t=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u9593\u63db\u53d6\u6642\u9593|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]] which causes thousands of death and many more seeking refuge.\n\n====Second period (October 1938 \u2013 December 1941)====\n[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]\n\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\n\nLocal Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|\u4e09\u5149\u653f\u7b56}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S\u0101ngu\u0101ng Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank\u014d Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.\n\nBy 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (\"points and lines\"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.\n\n===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===\n[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]\n\nAfter the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to \"improvise\" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].\n\n[[File:Lin Biao in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|115th Division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] Commander-in-chief [[Lin Biao]] in NRA uniform]]\n\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.\n\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as \"[[Mao Zedong Thought]]\". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news\n|title=Crisis\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=November 13, 1944}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the Western Allies===\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of war|War declaration]] against Japan by the Chongqing Nationalist Government in 9 December 1941]]\n[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang]] with [[Lieutenant General]] [[Joseph Stilwell]] in 1942, [[British Burma|Burma]]]]\n[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|On February 18, 1943, [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]\n[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|A US poster advocating helping China fight on]]\n\nFollowing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.<ref name=\"China Declares War\">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]].

However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over \"[[The Hump]]\".

For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].\n\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, \"Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War\", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243\u2013259.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D.

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"[[Europe first|Europe First]]\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed.

The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\n\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\n\nThe [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.\n\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\n\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]\n\nThe question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.\n\nIn the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name=\"China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\u2014New York Times\">{{Cite news\n|title=China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D81431F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=Hu%20jintao%20Victory%20Japan&st=cse\n|work=New York Times\n|date=September 4, 2005\n| first=Joseph\n| last=Kahn\n| accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing\" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, \"The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War\", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32\u201336</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===China-Japan relations===\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan.

However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters.

The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria).<ref name=\"Yomiuri Shimbun\"/>\n\nAnother source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers.

From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>{{efn|This number does not include the casualties of the large numbers of Chinese collaborator government troops fighting on the Japanese side.|group=efn}} From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war's end.

In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower.

It began with the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937 in which a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops escalated into a battle.

The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production and the [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant [[nationalism]], culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a new puppet state, [[Manchukuo]]; many historians cite 1931 as the beginning of the war.<ref name=\"Hotta2007\">{{cite book|last=Hotta|first=E.|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kih_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|date=25 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-60992-1|page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"Paine2012\">{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called \"incidents\".\n\nFollowing the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939\u201340 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive]] in central China.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. The following day the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China by airlifting material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]].\n\nOn August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria]], Japan capitulated to Allied forces.  Japan continued to occupy part of China's territory until it formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]]. The remaining Japanese occupation forces (excluding Manchuria) formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.\n\nAt the outcome of the [[Cairo Conference]] of November 22\u201326, 1943, the Allies of World War II had decided to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan by restoring all the territories that Japan annexed from China, including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Pescadores]], to China, and to expel Japan from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. China was recognized as one of the [[Four Policemen|Big Four of the Allies]] during the war and became one of the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{sfnp|Mitter|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bqc_YkuyaCIC&pg=PA369 369]}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HymSg_Pp7X0C&pg=PA223 |title= The New York Times Living History: World War II, 1942\u20131945: The Allied Counteroffensive|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas |accessdate=1 September 2015|isbn= 9780805072471|year= 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620101548/http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|archive-date=June 20, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], convened between 1946 and 1948, [[Criminal procedure|tried]] and punished the Japanese leaders for waging war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Allied Commander-in-Chief in the China theatre from 1942 to 1945]]\n[[File:WW2 Documentary \u4e8c\u6230\u7d00\u9304\u7247Part 1 of 7.ogg|thumb|left|The beginning of the war]]\n\nIn China, the war is most commonly known as the \"War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh| t=\u6297\u65e5\u6230\u722d| s=\u6297\u65e5\u6218\u4e89}}), and shortened to the \"Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh|\u6297\u65e5}}) or the \"War of Resistance\" ({{zh| s=\u6297\u6218| t=\u6297\u6230|links=no}}).

From the Japanese perspective was that localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively. A formal expression of these conflicts would potentially lead to American embargo in accordance with the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s]].<ref name=en>Jerald A. Combs.

Unifying the nation and repelling imperialism seemed a very remote possibility.{{sfn|Wilson|page=4}} Some warlords even aligned themselves with various foreign powers in their battles with each other.

Under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]], China remained fragmented and was unable to resist foreign incursions.{{sfn|Taylor|page=33}} For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, alternatively known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Taylor|page=57}}\n\n===Jinan incident===\n{{Main|Jinan incident}}\n\nThe [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military violently killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.{{sfn|Taylor|page=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|page=82}}\n\n===Reunification of China (1928)===\n{{Main|Chinese reunification (1928)}}\n\nAs the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] by the Kwantung Army in 1928.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 121</ref> His son, [[Zhang Xueliang]], took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria.

The Soviet [[Red Army]] victory over [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.<ref>Michael M. Walker, ''The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2017), p. 290.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.<ref>Michael M.

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ({{zh|c=\u6518\u5916\u5fc5\u5148\u5b89\u5167|links=no}}).\n\n==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==\n{{anchor|occupation}}\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]\n\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144</ref>\n\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.\n\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]\nIn 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].\n\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=\u83ef\u5317\u7279\u6b8a\u5316|p=hu\u00e1b\u011bit\u00e8sh\u016bh\u00f9a|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].\n\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He\u2013Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u20131936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===\n[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July\u2013August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]] strongly shook public opinion within Japan.\n\n===Battle of Shanghai===\n{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]\n\nThe [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the \"breaking point\" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u20131945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]\n\nOn August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].

These campaigns involved approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese.

They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March\u2013April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were expelled from their homes. About 800,000 drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger.\n\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.\n\n===1939\u201340: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===\n[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\n\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general.

However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\n\n===Japanese expansion===\n[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]\n\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas.

In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: \"the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart\". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.\n\n[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March\u2013April 1938]]\n\nEven under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.\n\nAfterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of \"trading space for time\" ({{zh|s=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6362\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4|t=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u9593\u63db\u53d6\u6642\u9593|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]] which causes thousands of death and many more seeking refuge.\n\n====Second period (October 1938 \u2013 December 1941)====\n[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]\n\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\n\nLocal Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|\u4e09\u5149\u653f\u7b56}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S\u0101ngu\u0101ng Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank\u014d Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.\n\nBy 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (\"points and lines\"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.\n\n===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===\n[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]\n\nAfter the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to \"improvise\" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].\n\n[[File:Lin Biao in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|115th Division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] Commander-in-chief [[Lin Biao]] in NRA uniform]]\n\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.\n\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as \"[[Mao Zedong Thought]]\". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news\n|title=Crisis\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=November 13, 1944}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the Western Allies===\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of war|War declaration]] against Japan by the Chongqing Nationalist Government in 9 December 1941]]\n[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang]] with [[Lieutenant General]] [[Joseph Stilwell]] in 1942, [[British Burma|Burma]]]]\n[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|On February 18, 1943, [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]\n[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|A US poster advocating helping China fight on]]\n\nFollowing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.<ref name=\"China Declares War\">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]].

However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over \"[[The Hump]]\".

For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].\n\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, \"Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War\", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243\u2013259.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D.

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"[[Europe first|Europe First]]\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed.

The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\n\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\n\nThe [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.\n\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\n\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]\n\nThe question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.\n\nIn the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name=\"China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\u2014New York Times\">{{Cite news\n|title=China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D81431F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=Hu%20jintao%20Victory%20Japan&st=cse\n|work=New York Times\n|date=September 4, 2005\n| first=Joseph\n| last=Kahn\n| accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing\" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, \"The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War\", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32\u201336</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===China-Japan relations===\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan.

However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters.

The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria).<ref name=\"Yomiuri Shimbun\"/>\n\nAnother source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers.

From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>{{efn|This number does not include the casualties of the large numbers of Chinese collaborator government troops fighting on the Japanese side.|group=efn}} From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war's end.

In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower.

Because at the time of Boles\u0142aw III's death he was still a minor (1138) the Duchy remained in the Seniorate until he reached the proper age, when W\u0142adys\u0142aw had to given him. But Henry could take formal possession of Sandomierz only when the High Duke was deposed and exiled, in 1146.\n\nAs ruler of Sandomierz, Henry appears only on the occasion of the Act of Foundation of a Church in his land. His Ducal title was rarely mentioned by the chronicles, who called him ''a son of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth'' or ''brother of [[Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly]]''. Some historians (for example [[M. G\u0142adysz]] and [[D. Guttner]]) advance a hypothesis that he was the \u201cKing of the Poles\u201d mentioned by the Greek chronicler [[John Kinnamos]]. If the theory were to be correct, Henry would have been the commander of the Polish contingent in the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147. This possible incursion in the Crusades was short (if really occur), because in 1149, together with his older brother Boles\u0142aw IV, he took part in a military expedition in [[Kiev]] to support the Grand Prince [[Iziaslav II of Kiev|Iziaslav II]].\n\nThe first and maybe the most famous of all Sandomierz's Dukes, Henry certainly ventured to the [[Holy Land]] in 1153-1154 (a number of Polish annals reported it under the year 1154 as did [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] in his Annals) and took part in the Crusade under the command of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]. Henry close affiliation to crusading resulted in the establishment of a commandery of the [[Hospitallers]] (between 1154 and 1166) in [[Stara Zago\u015b\u0107|Zago\u015b\u0107]].\n\nAfter returning to Poland with an air of holiness, Henry, together with his brothers, organized a Crusade against the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]. The military expedition, under the command of Boles\u0142aw IV and Henry, launched in the second half of 1166. He never return home.\n\nAccording to the chronicles, Henry was killed in battle against the Prussians, and this fact was without doubts. The date of his death, 18 October 1166, was known through indirect sources. However, there is a legend, where Henry apparently was killed in the current [[W\u0105brze\u017ano County]], probably in the vicinity of [[Nielub]] or [[Or\u0142owo, W\u0105brze\u017ano County|Or\u0142owo]], close to the [[Wieczno]] Lake.\n\nHenry never married and hence left no legitimate offspring. In his will, he left his Duchy to his youngest brother, [[Kazimierz II the Just]], who until that time, he remained without lands. These last will was done only partially. The destiny of the Duchy of Sandomierz could be shown in a document dated 31 December 1167:\n\n:''In the year 1166 in Poland during the reign of Princes Boles\u0142aw, Mieszko and Kazimierz, their fourth brother, Prince Henry died without offspring. His district has been divided into three parts; the seat of his sovereignty, Sandomierz, was granted to Boles\u0142aw, the older brother. The same day and year, [[Mateusz (bishop)|Mateusz]], [[List of Roman Catholic Bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]], also died.''\n\nThe other two parts were taken by the other surviving brothers: [[Wi\u015blica]], was given to Kazimiez II, and the rest to [[Mieszko III the Old]].\n\nHis remains were probably buried in a crypt of a church in [[Wi\u015blica]], where his grave is marked by an ornamental tombstone donated by his younger brother Kazimierz II. Only in 1173, after the death of Boles\u0142aw, Kazimierz finally could take the title of Duke of Sandomierz.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

This possible incursion in the Crusades was short (if really occur), because in 1149, together with his older brother Boles\u0142aw IV, he took part in a military expedition in [[Kiev]] to support the Grand Prince [[Iziaslav II of Kiev|Iziaslav II]].\n\nThe first and maybe the most famous of all Sandomierz's Dukes, Henry certainly ventured to the [[Holy Land]] in 1153-1154 (a number of Polish annals reported it under the year 1154 as did [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] in his Annals) and took part in the Crusade under the command of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]]. Henry close affiliation to crusading resulted in the establishment of a commandery of the [[Hospitallers]] (between 1154 and 1166) in [[Stara Zago\u015b\u0107|Zago\u015b\u0107]].\n\nAfter returning to Poland with an air of holiness, Henry, together with his brothers, organized a Crusade against the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]. The military expedition, under the command of Boles\u0142aw IV and Henry, launched in the second half of 1166. He never return home.\n\nAccording to the chronicles, Henry was killed in battle against the Prussians, and this fact was without doubts. The date of his death, 18 October 1166, was known through indirect sources. However, there is a legend, where Henry apparently was killed in the current [[W\u0105brze\u017ano County]], probably in the vicinity of [[Nielub]] or [[Or\u0142owo, W\u0105brze\u017ano County|Or\u0142owo]], close to the [[Wieczno]] Lake.\n\nHenry never married and hence left no legitimate offspring. In his will, he left his Duchy to his youngest brother, [[Kazimierz II the Just]], who until that time, he remained without lands. These last will was done only partially. The destiny of the Duchy of Sandomierz could be shown in a document dated 31 December 1167:\n\n:''In the year 1166 in Poland during the reign of Princes Boles\u0142aw, Mieszko and Kazimierz, their fourth brother, Prince Henry died without offspring. His district has been divided into three parts; the seat of his sovereignty, Sandomierz, was granted to Boles\u0142aw, the older brother. The same day and year, [[Mateusz (bishop)|Mateusz]], [[List of Roman Catholic Bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]], also died.''\n\nThe other two parts were taken by the other surviving brothers: [[Wi\u015blica]], was given to Kazimiez II, and the rest to [[Mieszko III the Old]].\n\nHis remains were probably buried in a crypt of a church in [[Wi\u015blica]], where his grave is marked by an ornamental tombstone donated by his younger brother Kazimierz II. Only in 1173, after the death of Boles\u0142aw, Kazimierz finally could take the title of Duke of Sandomierz.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
