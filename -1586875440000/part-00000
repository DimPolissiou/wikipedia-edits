He was then defeated by Roode, who pinned him while holding his tights. Right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a ''Zig Zag''. On the October 17 edition of ''SmackDown Live'', Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by pinfall while holding his tights, similar to how Roode defeated him. On the October 31 edition of ''SmackDown'', Ziggler failed to earn a spot on Team SmackDown for the [[Survivor Series (2017)|Survivor Series]] five-on-five elimination match against ''Raw'' after being defeated by Roode in a two-out-of-three falls match. Ziggler was involved in a verbal backstage confrontation with both Roode and United States Champion Baron Corbin on the December 5 episode of ''SmackDown'', where Roode defeated Corbin via disqualification after being attacked by Ziggler. The following week, Roode interfered in a match between Ziggler and Corbin in similar fashion, resulting in a disqualification victory for Ziggler. At [[Clash of Champions (2017)|Clash of Champions]], Ziggler defeated Corbin and Roode in a triple threat match to win his second United States Championship.<ref name=\"COC2017\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell's WWE Clash of Champions 2017 live review: AJ Styles vs. Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn put their WWE careers on the line vs. Randy Orton and Shinsuke Nakamura with Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan as referees|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2017/12/17/powells-wwe-clash-champions-2017-live-review-aj-styles-vs-jinder-mahal-wwe-championship-kevin-owens-sami-zayn-put-wwe-careers-line-vs-randy-orton-shinsuke-nak/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref> On the following episode of ''SmackDown'' on December 19, Ziggler held a celebration that was a retrospective of his WWE career; he said that the fans did not deserve him and placed the title belt in the ring before leaving.<ref name=\"SmackDown12192017\">{{cite web|last1=Barnett|first1=Jake|title=12/19 Barnett's WWE Smackdown Live TV Review: AJ Styles, Shinsuke Nakaura, and Randy Orton vs. Jinder Mahal, Kevin Owens, and Sami Zayn, The Usos vs. Chad Gable and Shelton Benjamin in a non-title match, Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan fallout from Clash of Champions|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2017/12/19/12-19-barnetts-wwe-smackdown-live-tv-review-aj-styles-shinsuke-nakaura-randy-orton-vs-jinder-mahal-kevin-owens-sami-zayn-usos-vs-chad-gable-shelton-benjamin-non-title-mat/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref> A week later, general manager [[Daniel Bryan]] said that Ziggler was nowhere to be found and had indeed vacated his title, so that a tournament to crown a new champion would be held (which was won by Bobby Roode).<ref name=\"SmackDown01162018\">{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Wade|title=KELLER'S WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT 1/16: U.S. Title Tournament semi-finals with Xavier vs. Jinder, Roode vs. Mojo, Shane-Bryan drama continues|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/01/16/kellers-wwe-smackdown-report-1-16/|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nZiggler returned at the [[Royal Rumble (2018)|Royal Rumble]] on January 28, 2018, as the surprise #30 entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match.

Originating with the seventh [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and his supporters, it became the nation's dominant political worldview for a generation. The term itself was in active use by the 1830s.<ref>The ''Providence'' (Rhode Island) ''Patriot'' 25 Aug 1839 stated: \"The state of things in Kentucky..is quite as favorable to the cause of Jacksonian democracy.\"  cited in \"Jacksonian democracy\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2019)</ref>\n\nThis era, called the Jacksonian Era (or [[Second Party System]]) by [[historians]] and [[political scientists]], lasted roughly from Jackson's 1828 election as president until [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] became the dominant issue in 1854 and the political repercussions of the [[American Civil War]] dramatically reshaped American politics. It emerged when the long-dominant [[Democratic-Republican Party]] became factionalized around the [[1824 United States presidential election]]. Jackson's supporters began to form the modern [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. His political rivals [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]] created the [[National Republican Party]], which would afterward combine with other anti-Jackson political groups to form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nBroadly speaking, the era was characterized by a [[Democracy|democratic]] spirit. It built upon Jackson's equal political policy, subsequent to ending what he termed a \"[[monopoly]]\" of government by [[elite]]s. Even before the Jacksonian era began, [[suffrage]] had been extended to a majority of white male adult citizens, a result which the Jacksonians celebrated.<ref>[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], pp. 15, 36. \"These figures suggest that by 1820 more than half of adult white males were casting votes, except in those states that still retained property requirements or substantial tax requirements for the franchise \u2013 Virginia, Rhode Island (the two states that maintained property restrictions through 1840), and New York as well as Louisiana.\"</ref> Jacksonian democracy also promoted the strength of the presidency and the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch at the expense of the [[United States Congress]], while also seeking to broaden the public's [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in government. The Jacksonians demanded elected (not appointed) judges and rewrote many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] to reflect the new [[Value (ethics)|values]]. In national terms, they favored geographical [[expansionism]], justifying it in terms of [[manifest destiny]]. There was usually a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] among both Jacksonians and Whigs that battles over slavery should be avoided.\n\nJackson's expansion of democracy was largely limited to [[European Americans]], and voting rights were extended to adult white males only. There was little or no progress (and in some cases, a regression) for the rights of [[African Americans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] during the extensive period of Jacksonian Democracy, spanning from 1829 to 1860.<ref name=\"Warren1999\">{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Mark E.|title=Democracy and Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KepLD0MXbhYC&pg=PA166|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521646871|pages=166\u2013}}</ref> Jackson's biographer [[Robert V. Remini]] argues:\n\n{{quote|[Jacksonian Democracy] stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable. ... As such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in American history\u2014Populism, Progressivism, the New and Fair Deals, and the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert V.

Belko]] in 2015 summarizes \"the core concepts underlying Jacksonian Democracy\" as:\n{{quote|equal protection of the laws; an aversion to a moneyed aristocracy, exclusive privileges, and monopolies, and a predilection for the common man; majority rule; and the welfare of the community over the individual.<ref>William S. Belko, \"'A Tax On The Many, To Enrich A Few': Jacksonian Democracy Vs. The Protective Tariff.\" ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'' 37.2 (2015): 277-289.</ref>}}\n\n[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] argued in 1945 that Jacksonian democracy was built on the following:<ref>Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ''The Age of Jackson'' (1945)</ref>\n* [[Universal manhood suffrage|Expanded suffrage]] \u2013 The Jacksonians believed that voting rights should be extended to all white men. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]]<ref>[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 14. \"Property- or tax-based qualifications were most strongly entrenched in the original thirteen states, and dramatic political battles took place at a series of prominent state constitutional conventions held during the late 1810s and 1820s.\"</ref> and by 1856 all requirements to own property and nearly all requirements to pay taxes had been dropped.<ref>[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], pp. 16, 35. \"By 1840, only three states retained a property qualification, North Carolina (for some state-wide offices only), Rhode Island, and Virginia. In 1856 North Carolina was the last state to end the practice. Tax-paying qualifications were also gone in all but a few states by the Civil War, but they survived into the 20th century in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.\"</ref><ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'' (2nd ed. 2009) p 29</ref>\n* [[Manifest destiny]] \u2013 This was the belief that Americans had a destiny to settle the [[American West]] and to expand control from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, and that the West should be settled by [[yeoman]] farmers. However, the [[Free Soil]] Jacksonians, notably [[Martin Van Buren]], argued for limitations on slavery in the new areas to enable the [[Poor White|poor white man]] to flourish''\u2014''they split with the main party briefly in 1848. The Whigs generally opposed Manifest Destiny and expansion, saying the nation should build up its cities.<ref>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Manifest Destiny'' (Greenwood Press, 2003).</ref>\n* [[Patronage]] \u2013 Also known as the [[spoils system]], patronage was the policy of placing political supporters into appointed offices. Many Jacksonians held the view that rotating political appointees in and out of office was not only the right, but also the duty of winners in political contests. Patronage was theorized to be good because it would encourage political participation by the common man and because it would make a politician more accountable for poor government service by his appointees. Jacksonians also held that long tenure in the civil service was corrupting, so civil servants should be rotated out of office at regular intervals. However, patronage often led to the hiring of incompetent and sometimes corrupt officials due to the emphasis on party loyalty above any other qualifications.<ref>M. Ostrogorski, ''Democracy and the Party System in the United States'' (1910)</ref>\n* [[Strict constructionism]] \u2013 Like the [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Jeffersonians]] who strongly believed in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], Jacksonians initially favored a federal government of limited powers. Jackson said that he would guard against \"all encroachments upon the legitimate sphere of State sovereignty\". However, he was not a [[states' rights]] extremist\u2014indeed, the [[Nullification Crisis]] would find Jackson fighting against what he perceived as state encroachments on the proper sphere of federal influence. This position was one basis for the Jacksonians' opposition to the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. As the Jacksonians consolidated power, they more often advocated expanding federal power, presidential power in particular.<ref>Forrest McDonald, ''States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776\u20131876'' (2002) pp 97-120</ref>\n* ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' \u2013 Complementing a strict construction of the Constitution, the Jacksonians generally favored a hands-off approach to the economy as opposed to the Whig program sponsoring modernization, railroads, banking and economic growth.<ref>William Trimble, \"The social philosophy of the Loco-Foco democracy.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 26.6 (1921): 705-715.

In Rhode Island, the [[Dorr Rebellion]] of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for any resident born outside of the United States. However, free black men lost voting rights in several states during this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-90499-1|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&pg=PT337#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Factions===\nThe period from 1824 to 1832 was politically chaotic. The [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[First Party System]] were dead and with no effective opposition, the old [[Democratic-Republican Party]] withered away. Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines. Political coalitions formed and dissolved and politicians moved in and out of alliances.<ref>Richard P. McCormick, ''The Second American Party System: Party Formation in the Jacksonian Era'' (1966).</ref>\n\nMost former Republicans supported [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]], while others such as [[Henry Clay]] opposed him. Most former Federalists, such as [[Daniel Webster]], opposed Jackson, although some like [[James Buchanan]] supported him. In 1828, [[John Quincy Adams]] pulled together a network of factions called the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], but he was defeated by Jackson. By the late 1830s, the Jacksonian Democrats and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] politically battled it out nationally and in every state.<ref>Michael F.

The new party (which did not get the name Democrats until 1834) swept to a landslide. As Mary Beth Norton explains regarding 1828:\n\n{{quote|Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcaiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA348|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=348|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781285974675}}</ref>}}\n\nThe platforms, speeches and editorials were founded upon a broad consensus among Democrats. As Norton et al. explain:\n\n{{quote|The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed a central government as the enemy of individual liberty and they believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich.

The long-term effect was to create the modern strong presidency.<ref>John Yoo, \"Andrew Jackson and Presidential Power.\" ''Charleston Law Review'' 2 (2007): 521+ [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1686&context=facpubs online].</ref> Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. However, Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform and the establishment of a public education system. For instance, they believed that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools.\n\nJackson looked at the Indian question in terms of military and legal policy, not as a problem due to their race.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Francis Paul |last=Prucha |title=Andrew Jackson's Indian policy: a reassessment |journal=[[Journal of American History]] |year=1969 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=527\u2013539 |jstor=1904204 |doi=10.2307/1904204 }}</ref> In 1813, Jackson adopted and treated as his own son a three-year-old Indian orphan\u2014seeing in him a fellow orphan that was \"so much like myself I feel an unusual sympathy for him\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Paul Rogin|title=Fathers and Children: Andrew Jackson and the Subjugation of the American Indian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I4DTLVXhAEC&pg=PA189|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=189|isbn=9781412823470}}</ref> In legal terms, when it became a matter of state sovereignty versus tribal sovereignty he went with the states and forced the Indians to fresh lands with no white rivals in what became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nAmong the leading followers was [[Stephen A.

According to his biographer Robert W. Johanssen:\n\n{{quote|Douglas was preeminently a Jacksonian, and his adherence to the tenets of what became known as Jacksonian democracy grew as his own career developed. ... Popular rule, or what he called would later call popular sovereignty, lay at the base of his political structure.

Numerous politicians and editors who were given favorable loans from the Bank run for cover as the financial temple crashes down. A famous fictional character, [[Major Jack Downing]] (right), cheers: \"Hurrah!

Cole, ''The Presidency of Andrew Jackson'' (1993)</ref>\n\nJacksonian policies included ending the bank of the United States, expanding westward and [[Indian removal|removing]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] from the Southeast. Jackson was denounced as a tyrant by opponents on both ends of the political spectrum such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]. This led to the rise of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nJackson created a [[spoils system]] to clear out elected officials in government of an opposing party and replace them with his supporters as a reward for their electioneering. With Congress controlled by his enemies, Jackson relied heavily on the power of the veto to block their moves.\n\nOne of the most important of these was the [[Maysville Road veto]] in 1830. A part of Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], the bill would have allowed for federal funding of a project to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky, Clay's home state. His primary objection was based on the local nature of the project. He argued it was not the federal government's job to fund projects of such a local nature and or those lacking a connection to the nation as a whole. The debates in Congress reflected two competing visions of federalism. The Jacksonians saw the union strictly as the cooperative aggregation of the individual states, while the Whigs saw the entire nation as a distinct entity.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Naomi |last=Wulf |title='The Greatest General Good': Road Construction, National Interest, and Federal Funding in Jacksonian America |journal=European Contributions to American Studies |year=2001 |volume=47 |pages=53\u201372 }}</ref>\n\nCarl Lane argues \"securing national debt freedom was a core element of Jacksonian democracy\". Paying off the national debt was a high priority which would make a reality of the Jeffersonian vision of America truly free from rich bankers, self-sufficient in world affairs, virtuous at home, and administered by a small government not prone to financial corruption or payoffs.<ref>Carl Lane, \"The elimination of the national debt in 1835 and the meaning of Jacksonian democracy.\" ''Essays in Economic & Business History'' 25 (2012) pp. 67-78.</ref>\n\nWhat became of  Jacksonian Democracy, according to [[Sean Wilentz]] was diffusion. Many ex-Jacksonians turned their crusade against the Money Power into one against the Slave Power and became Republicans. He points to the struggle over the [[Wilmot Proviso]] of 1846, the [[Free Soil Party]] revolt of 1848, and the mass defections from the Democrats in 1854 over the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].  Others Jacksonian leaders such as Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] endorsed slavery through the 1857 Dred Scott decision. Southern Jacksonians overwhelmingly endorsed secession in 1861, apart from a few opponents led by [[Andrew Johnson]]. In the North, Jacksonians Stephen A. Douglas and the [[War Democrat]]s fiercely opposed secession, while  Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan and the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] did not.<ref>Sean Wilentz, \"Politics, Irony, and the Rise of American Democracy.\" ''Journal of The Historical Society'' 6.4 (2006): 537-553, at p. 538, summarizing his book ''The rise of American democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln''  (2006).</ref>\n\n==Jacksonian Presidents==\nIn addition to Jackson, his second Vice President and one of the key organizational leaders of the Jacksonian Democratic Party, [[Martin Van Buren]], served as President. Van Buren was defeated in the next election by [[William Henry Harrison]]. Harrison died just 30 days into his term and his Vice President [[John Tyler]] quickly reached accommodation with the Jacksonians. Tyler was then succeeded by [[James K. Polk]], a Jacksonian who won the [[1844 United States presidential election|election of 1844]] with Jackson's endorsement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/polk-life-in-brief |title=James K.

[[James Buchanan]] served in Jackson's administration as Minister to Russia and as Polk's Secretary of State, but he did not pursue Jacksonian policies. Finally, [[Andrew Johnson]], who had been a strong supporter of Jackson, became President following the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, but by then Jacksonian democracy had been pushed off the stage of American politics.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Andrew Jackson presidential campaign, 1828]]\n* [[History of the United States Democratic Party]]\n* [[Jeffersonian democracy]]\n* [[Voting rights in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References and bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Adams, Sean Patrick, ed.

Originating with the seventh [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and his supporters, it became the nation's dominant political worldview for a generation. The term itself was in active use by the 1830s.<ref>The ''Providence'' (Rhode Island) ''Patriot'' 25 Aug 1839 stated: \"The state of things in Kentucky..is quite as favorable to the cause of Jacksonian democracy.\"  cited in \"Jacksonian democracy\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2019)</ref>\n\nThis era, called the Jacksonian Era (or [[Second Party System]]) by [[historians]] and [[political scientists]], lasted roughly from Jackson's 1828 election as president until [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] became the dominant issue in 1854 and the political repercussions of the [[American Civil War]] dramatically reshaped American politics. It emerged when the long-dominant [[Democratic-Republican Party]] became factionalized around the [[1824 United States presidential election]]. Jackson's supporters began to form the modern [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. His political rivals [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]] created the [[National Republican Party]], which would afterward combine with other anti-Jackson political groups to form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nBroadly speaking, the era was characterized by a [[Democracy|democratic]] spirit. It built upon Jackson's equal political policy, subsequent to ending what he termed a \"[[monopoly]]\" of government by [[elite]]s. Even before the Jacksonian era began, [[suffrage]] had been extended to a majority of white male adult citizens, a result which the Jacksonians celebrated.<ref>[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], pp. 15, 36. \"These figures suggest that by 1820 more than half of adult white males were casting votes, except in those states that still retained property requirements or substantial tax requirements for the franchise \u2013 Virginia, Rhode Island (the two states that maintained property restrictions through 1840), and New York as well as Louisiana.\"</ref> Jacksonian democracy also promoted the strength of the presidency and the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch at the expense of the [[United States Congress]], while also seeking to broaden the public's [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in government. The Jacksonians demanded elected (not appointed) judges and rewrote many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] to reflect the new [[Value (ethics)|values]]. In national terms, they favored geographical [[expansionism]], justifying it in terms of [[manifest destiny]]. There was usually a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] among both Jacksonians and Whigs that battles over slavery should be avoided.\n\nJackson's expansion of democracy was largely limited to [[European Americans]], and voting rights were extended to adult white males only. There was little or no progress (and in some cases, a regression) for the rights of [[African Americans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] during the extensive period of Jacksonian Democracy, spanning from 1829 to 1860.<ref name=\"Warren1999\">{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Mark E.|title=Democracy and Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KepLD0MXbhYC&pg=PA166|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521646871|pages=166\u2013}}</ref> Jackson's biographer [[Robert V.

Belko]] in 2015 summarizes \"the core concepts underlying Jacksonian Democracy\" as:\n{{quote|equal protection of the laws; an aversion to a moneyed aristocracy, exclusive privileges, and monopolies, and a predilection for the common man; majority rule; and the welfare of the community over the individual.<ref>William S. Belko, \"'A Tax On The Many, To Enrich A Few': Jacksonian Democracy Vs. The Protective Tariff.\" ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'' 37.2 (2015): 277-289.</ref>}}\n\n[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] argued in 1945 that Jacksonian democracy was built on the following:<ref>Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ''The Age of Jackson'' (1945)</ref>\n* [[Universal manhood suffrage|Expanded suffrage]] \u2013 The Jacksonians believed that voting rights should be extended to all white men. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]]<ref>[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 14. \"Property- or tax-based qualifications were most strongly entrenched in the original thirteen states, and dramatic political battles took place at a series of prominent state constitutional conventions held during the late 1810s and 1820s.\"</ref> and by 1856 all requirements to own property and nearly all requirements to pay taxes had been dropped.<ref>[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], pp. 16, 35. \"By 1840, only three states retained a property qualification, North Carolina (for some state-wide offices only), Rhode Island, and Virginia. In 1856 North Carolina was the last state to end the practice. Tax-paying qualifications were also gone in all but a few states by the Civil War, but they survived into the 20th century in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.\"</ref><ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'' (2nd ed. 2009) p 29</ref>\n* [[Manifest destiny]] \u2013 This was the belief that Americans had a destiny to settle the [[American West]] and to expand control from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, and that the West should be settled by [[yeoman]] farmers. However, the [[Free Soil]] Jacksonians, notably [[Martin Van Buren]], argued for limitations on slavery in the new areas to enable the [[Poor White|poor white man]] to flourish''\u2014''they split with the main party briefly in 1848. The Whigs generally opposed Manifest Destiny and expansion, saying the nation should build up its cities.<ref>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Manifest Destiny'' (Greenwood Press, 2003).</ref>\n* [[Patronage]] \u2013 Also known as the [[spoils system]], patronage was the policy of placing political supporters into appointed offices. Many Jacksonians held the view that rotating political appointees in and out of office was not only the right, but also the duty of winners in political contests. Patronage was theorized to be good because it would encourage political participation by the common man and because it would make a politician more accountable for poor government service by his appointees. Jacksonians also held that long tenure in the civil service was corrupting, so civil servants should be rotated out of office at regular intervals. However, patronage often led to the hiring of incompetent and sometimes corrupt officials due to the emphasis on party loyalty above any other qualifications.<ref>M. Ostrogorski, ''Democracy and the Party System in the United States'' (1910)</ref>\n* [[Strict constructionism]] \u2013 Like the [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Jeffersonians]] who strongly believed in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], Jacksonians initially favored a federal government of limited powers. Jackson said that he would guard against \"all encroachments upon the legitimate sphere of State sovereignty\". However, he was not a [[states' rights]] extremist\u2014indeed, the [[Nullification Crisis]] would find Jackson fighting against what he perceived as state encroachments on the proper sphere of federal influence. This position was one basis for the Jacksonians' opposition to the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. As the Jacksonians consolidated power, they more often advocated expanding federal power, presidential power in particular.<ref>Forrest McDonald, ''States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776\u20131876'' (2002) pp 97-120</ref>\n* ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' \u2013 Complementing a strict construction of the Constitution, the Jacksonians generally favored a hands-off approach to the economy as opposed to the Whig program sponsoring modernization, railroads, banking and economic growth.<ref>William Trimble, \"The social philosophy of the Loco-Foco democracy.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 26.6 (1921): 705-715.

In Rhode Island, the [[Dorr Rebellion]] of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for any resident born outside of the United States. However, free black men lost voting rights in several states during this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-90499-1|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&pg=PT337#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe fact that a man was now legally allowed to vote did not necessarily mean he routinely voted. He had to be pulled to the polls, which became the most important role of the local parties. They systematically sought out potential voters and brought them to the polls. Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of adult male population in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]].<ref>William G.

Prior to the [[1832 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1832]], the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] conducted the nation's first [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating convention]]. Held in Baltimore, Maryland, September 26\u201328, 1831, it transformed the process by which political parties select their presidential and vice-presidential candidates.<ref>William Preston Vaughn, ''The Anti-Masonic Party in the United States: 1826\u20131843'' (2009)</ref>\n\n===Factions===\nThe period from 1824 to 1832 was politically chaotic. The [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[First Party System]] were dead and with no effective opposition, the old [[Democratic-Republican Party]] withered away. Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines. Political coalitions formed and dissolved and politicians moved in and out of alliances.<ref>Richard P. McCormick, ''The Second American Party System: Party Formation in the Jacksonian Era'' (1966).</ref>\n\nMost former Republicans supported [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]], while others such as [[Henry Clay]] opposed him. Most former Federalists, such as [[Daniel Webster]], opposed Jackson, although some like [[James Buchanan]] supported him. In 1828, [[John Quincy Adams]] pulled together a network of factions called the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], but he was defeated by Jackson. By the late 1830s, the Jacksonian Democrats and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] politically battled it out nationally and in every state.<ref>Michael F.

The new party (which did not get the name Democrats until 1834) swept to a landslide. As Mary Beth Norton explains regarding 1828:\n\n{{quote|Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president.

As Norton et al. explain:\n\n{{quote|The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed a central government as the enemy of individual liberty and they believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich.

The long-term effect was to create the modern strong presidency.<ref>John Yoo, \"Andrew Jackson and Presidential Power.\" ''Charleston Law Review'' 2 (2007): 521+ [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1686&context=facpubs online].</ref> Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. However, Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform and the establishment of a public education system. For instance, they believed that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools.\n\nJackson looked at the Indian question in terms of military and legal policy, not as a problem due to their race.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Francis Paul |last=Prucha |title=Andrew Jackson's Indian policy: a reassessment |journal=[[Journal of American History]] |year=1969 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=527\u2013539 |jstor=1904204 |doi=10.2307/1904204 }}</ref> In 1813, Jackson adopted and treated as his own son a three-year-old Indian orphan\u2014seeing in him a fellow orphan that was \"so much like myself I feel an unusual sympathy for him\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Paul Rogin|title=Fathers and Children: Andrew Jackson and the Subjugation of the American Indian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I4DTLVXhAEC&pg=PA189|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=189|isbn=9781412823470}}</ref> In legal terms, when it became a matter of state sovereignty versus tribal sovereignty he went with the states and forced the Indians to fresh lands with no white rivals in what became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nAmong the leading followers was [[Stephen A. Douglas]], senator from Illinois, who was the key player in the passage of the compromise of 1850, and was a leading contender for the 1852 Democratic presidential nomination.  According to his biographer Robert W. Johanssen:\n\n{{quote|Douglas was preeminently a Jacksonian, and his adherence to the tenets of what became known as Jacksonian democracy grew as his own career developed. ... Popular rule, or what he called would later call popular sovereignty, lay at the base of his political structure.

Numerous politicians and editors who were given favorable loans from the Bank run for cover as the financial temple crashes down. A famous fictional character, [[Major Jack Downing]] (right), cheers: \"Hurrah!

Cole, ''The Presidency of Andrew Jackson'' (1993)</ref>\n\nJacksonian policies included ending the bank of the United States, expanding westward and [[Indian removal|removing]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] from the Southeast. Jackson was denounced as a tyrant by opponents on both ends of the political spectrum such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]. This led to the rise of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nJackson created a [[spoils system]] to clear out elected officials in government of an opposing party and replace them with his supporters as a reward for their electioneering. With Congress controlled by his enemies, Jackson relied heavily on the power of the veto to block their moves.\n\nOne of the most important of these was the [[Maysville Road veto]] in 1830. A part of Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], the bill would have allowed for federal funding of a project to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky, Clay's home state. His primary objection was based on the local nature of the project. He argued it was not the federal government's job to fund projects of such a local nature and or those lacking a connection to the nation as a whole. The debates in Congress reflected two competing visions of federalism. The Jacksonians saw the union strictly as the cooperative aggregation of the individual states, while the Whigs saw the entire nation as a distinct entity.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Naomi |last=Wulf |title='The Greatest General Good': Road Construction, National Interest, and Federal Funding in Jacksonian America |journal=European Contributions to American Studies |year=2001 |volume=47 |pages=53\u201372 }}</ref>\n\nCarl Lane argues \"securing national debt freedom was a core element of Jacksonian democracy\". Paying off the national debt was a high priority which would make a reality of the Jeffersonian vision of America truly free from rich bankers, self-sufficient in world affairs, virtuous at home, and administered by a small government not prone to financial corruption or payoffs.<ref>Carl Lane, \"The elimination of the national debt in 1835 and the meaning of Jacksonian democracy.\" ''Essays in Economic & Business History'' 25 (2012) pp. 67-78.</ref>\n\nWhat became of  Jacksonian Democracy, according to [[Sean Wilentz]] was diffusion. Many ex-Jacksonians turned their crusade against the Money Power into one against the Slave Power and became Republicans. He points to the struggle over the [[Wilmot Proviso]] of 1846, the [[Free Soil Party]] revolt of 1848, and the mass defections from the Democrats in 1854 over the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].  Others Jacksonian leaders such as Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] endorsed slavery through the 1857 Dred Scott decision. Southern Jacksonians overwhelmingly endorsed secession in 1861, apart from a few opponents led by [[Andrew Johnson]]. In the North, Jacksonians Stephen A. Douglas and the [[War Democrat]]s fiercely opposed secession, while  Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan and the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] did not.<ref>Sean Wilentz, \"Politics, Irony, and the Rise of American Democracy.\" ''Journal of The Historical Society'' 6.4 (2006): 537-553, at p. 538, summarizing his book ''The rise of American democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln''  (2006).</ref>\n\n==Jacksonian Presidents==\nIn addition to Jackson, his second Vice President and one of the key organizational leaders of the Jacksonian Democratic Party, [[Martin Van Buren]], served as President. Van Buren was defeated in the next election by [[William Henry Harrison]]. Harrison died just 30 days into his term and his Vice President [[John Tyler]] quickly reached accommodation with the Jacksonians. Tyler was then succeeded by [[James K.

In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892\u2013907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus effectively putting an end to the [[feudal]] system used by the Samanids. It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.\n\nThe Samanid Empire is part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], which saw the creation of a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. This would later lead to the formation of the [[Turko-Persian tradition|Turko-Persian]] culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Turko-Persia in Historical Perspective|last = Canfield L.|first = Robert|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9780521522915|location = |pages = 12 }}</ref>\n\nThe Samanids promoted the arts, giving rise to the advancement of science and literature, and thus attracted scholars such as [[Rudaki]], [[Ferdowsi]], and [[Avicenna]].

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year. Muhammad ibn Harun thereafter fled to [[Daylam]], while Ismail reconquered Tabaristan and Gorgan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}} In 901, [[Amr ibn al-Layth|Amr Saffari]] was defeated at the battle of Balkh by the Samanids, which reduced the Saffarid dynasty to a minor tributary in Sistan.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=35}} It was during this period that the Samanids were at their height of power, ruling as far as [[Qazvin]] in the west<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/esmail-b-ahmad-b-asad-samani |title=ESM\u0100\u02bf\u012aL, b.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals.

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it was by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and its surroundings by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S.

Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally.

The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxania and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most favorable language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Only less than 2,000 of his poetry lines have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse forms of medieval Persian poetry; mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions were taken in special interest, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age, was Ferdowsi\u2014he was born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.

Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world. An outstanding library known as ''Siw\u0101n al-hikma'' (\"Storehouse of Wisdom\") was put together in Bukhara, known for its various types of books.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=94}}\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Two Bowls with Figures and a Footed Plate with Birds MET DP258911.jpg|thumb|Example of figural earthenware ceramics from Samanid period.]]\n\n==== Crafts ====\n[[File:Bowl with Arabic Inscription.jpg|thumb|Bowl with Arabic Inscription]]\nDue to extensive excavations at [[Nishapur]], Iran in the mid-twentieth century, Samanid pottery is well-represented in Islamic art collections around the world.

It has a white slip with black slip decoration under a transparent glaze. There is calligraphic decoration all around the bowl. It is elongated at some points and compressed in other areas of the letter to the point where it almost looks abstract. Right in the center of the bowl is a black dot. If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl. This may be because the artists used to practice beforehand on paper.

The main competitor of this family is [[macOS]] by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for personal computers and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for mobile devices (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}}).\n** [[Windows Server]]: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is [[Windows Server 2019]]. Unlike its client sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this family is [[Linux]]. (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

However, following the successful release of [[Windows 3.0]], the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended [[32-bit]] port of the [[Windows API]] known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows [[API]]s (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be [[Porting|ported]] to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.<ref name=\"insident\">{{cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | url= https://archive.org/details/insidewindowsnt00cust | url-access= registration | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | isbn=1-55615-481-X}}</ref><ref name=\"thurrott-nt\"/>\n\nThe first release of the resulting operating system, [[Windows NT 3.1]] (named to associate it with [[Windows 3.1]]) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. [[Windows NT 3.5]] was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for [[Novell]]'s [[NetWare]], and was followed up by [[Windows NT 3.51]] in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the [[PowerPC]] architecture. [[Windows NT 4.0]] was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of [[Windows 95]] to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]], a successor to NT 4.0. The Windows NT name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the Windows brand.<ref name=\"thurrott-nt\">{{cite web | last=Thurrott | first=Paul | title=Windows Server 2003: The Road To Gold - Part One: The Early Years | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp | date= January 24, 2003 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050101005634/http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp | archivedate = January 1, 2005| accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Windows XP====\n{{Main|Windows XP}}\nThe next major version of Windows NT, [[Windows XP]], was released on October 25, 2001.

This migration involved 3.5&nbsp;million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository.<ref name=PBright /> By May 2017, 90 percent of its engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.<ref name=PBright>{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Peter|title=Windows switch to Git almost complete: 8,500 commits and 1,760 builds each day|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|date=24 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524171707/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|archivedate=May 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Multilingual support====\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection.

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

(c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8.

This migration involved 3.5&nbsp;million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository.<ref name=PBright /> By May 2017, 90 percent of its engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.<ref name=PBright>{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Peter|title=Windows switch to Git almost complete: 8,500 commits and 1,760 builds each day|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|date=24 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524171707/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|archivedate=May 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Multilingual support====\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection. However, a lot of the advantages of being a true multi-user operating system were nullified by the fact that, prior to Windows Vista, the first user account created during the setup process was an [[Windows administrator|administrator]] account, which was also the default for new accounts. Though [[Windows XP]] did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights&nbsp;\u2013 partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights&nbsp;\u2013 and so most home users ran as administrator all the time.\n\n[[Windows Vista]] changes this<ref>Microsoft describes in detail the steps taken to combat this in a TechNet bulletin.

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

After the capture of [[Beersheba]], by the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF), the [[Gaza City|Gaza]] to Beersheba line became increasingly weakened and, seven days later, the EEF successfully forced the [[Ottoman Turkish Empire]]'s [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Armies]] to withdraw. During the following seven days of pursuit, the Turkish forces were pushed back to [[Jaffa]]. There followed three weeks of hard fighting in the [[Judean Hills]] before [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem was captured]] on 9 December 1917. During five and a half weeks of almost continuous offensive operations, the EEF captured {{convert|47.5|mi|km}} of territory.\n\nAfter a joint attack by the [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX]] and the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], Beersheba at the eastern end of the Gaza to Beersheba line, was captured. The next day, on 1 November, the [[Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe]] began, with an advance north of Beersheba into the Judean foothills, by the [[53rd (Welsh) Division|53rd (Welsh)]] and the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]]s. This move up the road from Beersheba to [[Jerusalem]], also threatened [[Hebron]] and [[Bethlehem]]. Then, during the night of 1/2 November, the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] took place on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, when limited attacks by the [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]] were made against strongly held, formidable defences. The next day, the fiercely contested fighting south of Tel el Khuweilfe by the EEF was not designed to capture [[Hebron]], but to create sufficient area for the deployment of the XX Corps, for a [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] attack on the central defences of the old Gaza to Beersheba line. Fighting for the Beersheba to Jerusalem road, also encouraged the Turkish commanders to deploy their reserves, to hold the EEF threat. On 6 November the [[Battle of Hareira and Sheria]] was launched on the centre of the old line, half-way between Gaza and Beersheba, and Hareira was captured; but it was not until late the next day, that the Sheria position was finally captured by the [[60th (London) Division]], after a failed [[Charge at Sheria|charge]] by the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]] ([[Australian Mounted Division]]). The Seventh and the Eighth Armies were by now in full retreat from the remains of the old Gaza to Beersheba line.\n\nOn 7 November, the second day of the battle for Hareira and Sheria, the [[52nd (Lowland) Division]] and the [[Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade]] advanced  unopposed through Gaza to attack strong rearguard positions at Wadi el Hesi, which were [[Capture of Wadi el Hesi|captured the next day]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Stalemate in Southern Palestine}}\n[[File:Falls SkBEasternDesertDet.jpeg|thumb|On the edge of the Eastern Desert]]\n\nAfter the first two battles for Gaza, it was obvious to British commanders that large reinforcements were needed \"to set General Murray's army in motion again.\"<ref>Wavell 1968 p. 89</ref> Indeed, Murray made it clear to the [[War Cabinet]] and the [[Imperial General Staff]] early in May, that he could not invade Palestine without reinforcements.<ref>Keogh 1955 p. 122</ref> The War Office assured him in the same month, that he should prepare to receive reinforcements, which would bring the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF) up to six infantry and three mounted divisions.<ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 360</ref> However by July, when [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Edmund Allenby]] took command of the EEF, 5,150 infantry and 400 yeomanry reinforcements were still needed after the casualties suffered during the battles for Gaza.<ref>Allenby to Robertson 12 July 1917 in Hughes 2004 pp. 34\u20135</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 1917 summer in the northern hemisphere, the political and the strategic interests of the British government and the EEF coincided. This was due in part to the failure on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[French Republic]]'s [[Nivelle offensive]] and the success of the [[German Empire|German]] submarine campaign against [[British Empire]] shipping.<ref name=\"Downes660\">Downes 1938 p. 660</ref> The destruction of British shipping caused severe shortages in Britain, and although the [[United States of America]] had entered the war, their military support would not be apparent for some time. Britain was about to enter a fourth year of extremely costly war, and their [[Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], appreciated the need to take into account the [[Home front during World War I|\"Home Front]].\" He believed a striking military success could bolster the morale of the civil population, and he told Allenby that \"he wanted Jerusalem as a Christmas present for the British nation.\" Lloyd Gorge made clear that this victory was needed in order \"to strengthen the staying power and morale\" of Britain.<ref>Wavell 1968 p. 96</ref> The British [[War Cabinet]] needed a successful Palestine offensive at a time when there was not much good news coming out of the Western Front, and when it was beginning to look like the war could extend into 1919. If they could capture Jerusalem this would put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which could in turn place a strain on the German alliance, at the same time enhancing Britain's long term aim of strengthening their influence in the Middle East. By the end of October, the EEF was ready to attack.<ref name=\"Downes660\"/><ref name=\"Bruce 2002 p. 116\">Bruce 2002 p. 116</ref>\n\nThe decision to launch a major offensive in Palestine, in the autumn of 1917, was also based on \"very sound strategical reasons.\" The collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in the spring led to the withdrawal of Russia from the war, as a consequence of the [[Russian Revolution]], and freed up large numbers of Ottoman Empire troops, which had been fighting the Russians on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. These Ottoman units became available to reinforce the Palestine front and were in the process of assembling near Aleppo, along with German soldiers and equipment. They were to launch operations to recapture [[Baghdad]], which had been [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|captured by the British in March]]. The threat to Baghdad could be more economically opposed by an EEF offensive in southern Palestine. Rather than sending reinforcements to General [[Frederick Stanley Maude|Frederick S. Maude]]'s [[Mesopotamia]]n army holding Baghdad, British reinforcements from the [[Salonika front]], which the [[War Office]] wanted to scale down, would strengthen the EEF.<ref name=\"Wavell96\u20137\">Wavell 1968 pp. 96\u20137</ref>\n\nAllenby's strategical objective was a defeat of the Ottoman army in Southern Palestine, decisive enough to ensure Ottoman reinforcements destined for Baghdad were diverted to Palestine.<ref name=\"Wavell96\u20137\"/> However, by 5 October, General [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]], telegraphed Allenby that the War Cabinet desired him to eliminate the Ottoman Empire out of the war by a \"heavy defeat\", followed by the occupation of the Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem line. He was to be supplied with \"fresh British divisions ... at the rate of one every sixteen days.\" It was not until after the launching of the offensive that Allenby was told such increases to his force were improbable.<ref name=\"Falls27\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 27</ref>\n\n[[File:AWMJ02971WadiGhuzze.jpg|thumb|A military railway bridge over the Wadi Ghazzeh, with water storage beyond. EEF horses watered in this vicinity during September and October 1917]]\n\nAllenby estimated the Ottoman Army could have 20 divisions, with no more than 12 on the front line. However, as these could be replaced by the Ottoman Army, the EEF could not field more than 14 divisions after the doubling of the railway line from  [[El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya|Kantara]], because of the limitations of the EEF's [[lines of communication|supply lines]].<ref name=\"Falls27\"/> Between April and October 1917, both the EEF and the Ottoman Army laid railways and water pipe lines, and sent troops, guns and huge quantities of ammunition to the front.<ref>Cutlack 1941 p. 64</ref> By mid-October 1917, a staff appreciation from London acknowledged the strength of the Ottoman defenders in Southern Palestine, and that any attempt to dislodge them from the Gaza to Beersheba line could cost three divisions. The appreciation acknowledged that \"[T]he Turk is a stubborn fighter in trenches and we must expect that in any event he will stand long enough to cause us serious loss ... we must be prepared to supply General Allenby with three more divisions\" to relieve weakened divisions.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 124</ref>\n\n=== Battlefield ===\nThe Gaza to Beersheba line was defended by both sides during the [[Stalemate in Southern Palestine]] from April to the end of October 1917. The EEF front line extended for {{convert|22|mi|km}} from the Mediterranean coast at Gaza to a point on the [[Wadi Ghazza|Wadi Ghazzeh]] near El Gamli, about {{convert|14|mi|km}} south-west of Sharia and {{convert|18|mi|km}} west of Beersheba on the southern edge of the plain of [[Philistia]]. On the coast, a strip of sand dunes varying between {{convert|2|\u2013|4|mi|km}} wide was impassable for wheeled vehicles. Between the sand dunes and the Judean Hills, which rise to {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, the mainly undulating \"down-land\" plains stretched between {{convert|15|and|20|mi|km}} wide. The plains were intersected by many wadis, which transformed into \"raging torrents,\" rushing down from the bare rocky Judaean mountains during the wet winters. The region was sparsely populated, with each village depending on its well for water, while crops of barley were grown. From this area, the topographical conditions of the plain are unchanged for {{convert|80|mi|km}} northwards, becoming the Plain of Sharon from Jaffa, to finally end at [[Mount Carmel]] near [[Haifa]].<ref name=\"Blenkinsop 1925 p. 200\">Blenkinsop 1925 p. 200</ref>\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe Ottoman Army in Palestine commanded by [[Marshal]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] was nearly 50,000 strong, while General Allenby\u2019s EEF was 76,000 strong.<ref>Jerusalem Memorial 1928 p. 9</ref>\n\n=== Defending force ===\nUntil June 1917, Sheria was the headquarters of the German-commanded defenders holding the Gaza-Beersheba line.<ref>Cutlack 1941 p. 57 note</ref> In August 1917, the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth Army]] was structured as:\n* Fourth Army (Syria-Palestine)\n*** 3rd Cavalry Division\n** VIII Corps\n*** 48th Division\n** XII Corps\n*** 23rd Division\n*** 44th Division\n** [[XV Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XV Corps]]\n*** 43rd Division\n** [[XX Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XX Corps]]\n*** 16th Division\n*** 54th Division\n** [[XXII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XXII Corps]]\n*** 3rd Division\n*** 7th Division\n*** 53rd Division<ref name=\"Erickson 2001 p. 170\">Erickson 2001 p. 170</ref>\n\nThe Fourth Army in Palestine was reorganised into two corps, the XX Corps was expanded from the 16th and 54th Infantry Divisions to include the 178th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Cavalry Division, while the XXII Corps' three divisions remained unchanged.<ref name=\"Erickson 2001 p. 163\">Erickson 2001 p. 163</ref> The XX Corps was headquartered at  [[Huj, Gaza|Huj]], while the XXII Corps defended Gaza with the 3rd and 53rd Divisions.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35</ref> By July the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] commanded by [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]] consisting of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division, had an estimated strength of 46,000 rifles, 28,000 sabres and 200 guns.<ref name=\"Hill 1978 p. 120\">Hill 1978 p. 120</ref><ref>Bruce 2002 p. 115</ref>\n\n==== Yildirim Army Group ====\n[[File:ArabCamelCorps.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Arab Camel Corps]]\nGermany had suggested that six or seven Ottoman divisions released as a consequence of the Russian Army's withdrawal from the war, should attack Mesopotamia with German support. Germany would supply ammunition, equipment, troops and gold along with one of Germany's \"most distinguished soldiers\", Erich von Falkenhayn, and an Army Headquarters staff. These German reinforcements included the German Asia Corps, three battalion groups of \"handpicked and thoroughly trained\" infantry, very strongly supported by artillery, machine guns, mortars, aircraft and mechanical transport. The Ottoman Empire would contribute a new Seventh Army made up of divisions transferred from the Caucasus and the Balkan fronts.<ref>Keogh 1955 pp. 129\u201330</ref>\n\nFollowing the formation of the Yildirim Army Group in June 1917, substantial forces were deployed to Syria and Palestine, where they continued to hold the Fourth Army defences. Already in Palestine were the 3rd, 7th, 16th, and 54th Infantry Divisions while the 26th 27th, and 53rd Infantry Divisions arrived during the summer. The 3rd, 7th 16th, and 26th Infantry Divisions had fought in the Gallipoli campaign and the 3rd Cavalry Division had fought in the Caucasian Campaigns. These seven infantry divisions and one cavalry division formed the recently activated Ottoman Eighth Army.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 102</ref><ref name=\"Erickson172\">Erickson 2001 p. 172</ref>\n\nOn establishment, the Yildirim Army Group consisted of Ottoman Army troops already in Palestine and Mesopotamia. These included the 19th and the 20th Divisions from Galicia, the 24th and the 42nd Divisions from the Dardanelles, the 48th Division from the Caucasus, the 50th Division from Macedonia and the 59th from Adana in the Gulf of Iskanderun. The 1st and 11th Divisions were also transferred from the Caucasus to the Yildirim Army Group, arriving in time for the attempt to retake Jerusalem at the end of December, and in March 1918 respectively.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 24\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 24</ref><ref group=\"Note\">While the 19th and 24th Divisions arrived before the battles for the Gaza to Beersheba line, the 20th Division arrived in time for the defence of Jerusalem, the 48th Division arrived soon after the loss of Jerusalem.

[[Enver Pasha]] took von Falkenhayn's advice to send the Yildirim Army Group to Palestine, to face the growing threat reported by Kress von Kressenstein. Enver Pasha issued orders on 26 September for the Fourth Army headquarters to move to Damascus, at the same time dividing the area in half, leaving Cemal Pasha with responsibility for Syria and western Arabia. On 2 October, Enver Pasha activated the new Eighth Army, commanded by Kress von Kressenstein, and deployed it along with the Seventh Army, commanded by Mustafa Kemal, to the Yildirim Army Group, commanded by von Falkenhayn. However, in late September Mustafa Kemal disagreed with some of Enver Pasha's decisions and the new command structure. He advised adopting a defensive military policy, in response to the superior British lines of communications, which would ensure continued numerical superiority in any contested theatre. He thought this imbalance would make it impossible for the Yildirim Army Group to go on the offensive. He advised merging the Seventh and the Eighth Armies, offering to step down in favour of Kress von Kressenstein. Several weeks later Mustafa Kemal resigned and Fevzi Pasa took command of the Seventh Army which was still assembling near Aleppo.<ref>Erickson 2001 p. 171, 2007 p. 115</ref> By October 1917 the headquarters of the Eighth Army commanded by Kress von Keressenstein was at [[Huleikat]] to north of Huj.<ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 36</ref>\n\nThese massive reorganisations began to be implemented in October, but by the end of the month, only the headquarters of the Seventh and Eighth Armies were in position to take the field.<ref>Erickson 2001 171\u20132</ref> On 1 October, the Eighth Army consisted of 2,894 officers, 69,709 men, 29,116 rifles, 403 machine guns, 268 artillery pieces, and 27,575 animals.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 128</ref> Between 10 and 28 October 1917, the Eighth Army shifted three infantry divisions to reserve positions, although the defence of Beersheba remained the responsibility of the Ottoman III Corps, consisting of the mainly Arab 27th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Infantry Regiment \"minus its machine guns,\" with the two regiments of the 3rd Cavalry Division.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 p. 117\">Erickson 2007 p. 117</ref>\n\nOn 28 October, orders were issued by von Falkenhayn's Yildirim Army Group headquarters, directing Kress von Kressenstein's Eighth Army to assume responsibility for the western, or Gaza half, of the Ottoman front line, while Fevzi Pasa's Seventh Army took responsibility for the eastern half including Beersheba. The III Corps headquarters which commanded the 27th Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division was transferred from the Eighth to the Seventh Army. The 16th and 24th Infantry Divisions and the 19th Infantry Division on its way south were also assigned to the Seventh Army.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 pp. 115\u20136\">Erickson 2007 pp. 115\u20136</ref> Both the 19th and 24th Divisions arrived before the battle began.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 24\"/> Kress von Kressenstein later described the 27th Infantry Division defending Beersheba, as 'badly trained, badly organised, and composed of Arabs who had to be watched'. He recommended the division be deactivated and its soldiers deployed elsewhere as reinforcements. He suggested the 19th Infantry Division, Mustafa Kemal's \"famous Gallipoli division,\" replace it at Beersheba.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 p. 117\"/> Regarded by the Ottoman General Staff as the most powerful infantry division in the Ottoman Army's order of battle, the 19th Division which had also served in Galicia, had an unusually powerful artillery component. The commander of the Yildirim Army Group, von Falkenhayn, ordered the 19th Infantry Division moved into reserve near Cemame [Jemame?] nearer to Gaza than Beersheba.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 p. 117\"/>\n\nBy 31 October, nine Ottoman infantry divisions and one cavalry division with a total strength of up to 45,000 rifles, 1,500 sabres and 300 guns defended the Gaza to Beersheba line. Gaza was defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps, with its XX Corps defending Sheria, while the Seventh Army's III Corps defended Beersheba. The recently arrived commander of the Seventh Army, Fevzi Pasha, \"played no active role in command during the early stages of the third battle of Gaza and the entire front remained under Kress's control.\"<ref>Bruce 2002 p. 125</ref>\n\n==== Assault battalions ====\nEach infantry division was reorganised into three infantry regiments, each consisting of three infantry battalions, and one assault battalion. The specialised assault or [[Stormtrooper|storm troop]] divisions of the German Army were never formed by the Ottoman Army.<ref>Erickson 2007 pp. 104\u20135</ref> However, the assault battalions were established by order of Enver Pasha on 1 September 1917, during a general activation of ''Sto\u00dftruppen'' style assault troops, across the whole Ottoman Army. The XV Corps, the First Army and the Fourth Army established the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Assault Battalions respectively. In addition, Enver Pasha ordered each infantry division in the Yildirim Army Group and in the Fourth Army, to establish assault detachments consisting of the best officers, NCOs, and men from the best units in the division. These soldiers were required to be 27 years old or younger, intelligent, healthy and strong. Each assault unit was given a one-month assault course, better rations, and a badge embroidered with a hand grenade.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 104</ref>\n\n==== Aircraft ====\nDuring October, 56 aircraft in Nos. 301, 302, 303 and 304 Squadrons of the German Flying Corps, arrived in Palestine from Germany. At the time No. 14 (Ottoman) Squadron's A.E.G. two-seaters, were stationed at Kutrani.<ref>Cutlack 1941 p. 81</ref>\n\n====Characteristics====\nIt has also been claimed that after \"Russia's collapse in 1917\" that reinforcements needed in Palestine were sent to the Caucasus, leaving the Ottoman army low in morale. In describing the situation, Hughes writes that \"many had received no mail from home in years. The hapless Turkish recruits awaited the EEF assault in 'fragile tents' with 'nothing to cheer their spirits'.\"<ref>Hughes 1999 p. 51</ref> This was because \"the condition of the Ottoman railway system was such that the Turks had difficulty maintaining any substantial force in Palestine either for defensive or offensive operations.\" Based on a single track for 1,275 miles, with sections of standard and narrow gauge, the Ottoman lines of communication have been described as \"appalling.\"<ref>Hughes 1999 p. 54</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Army in Palestine in 1917 continued to demonstrate most of the characteristics they had during the first two years of war. The army was operationally and tactically aggressive, executing both defensive and offensive operations and training continuously in realistic, up-to-date methods at troop level and in centralised settings. According to Erickson, \"[d]ivisions were task-organised\" for a variety of \"specific tactical missions.\" The commanders were experienced, highly trained and capable leaders who \"continued to function well in its third year of a multi-front total war.\"<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 109</ref>\n\nHowever, it has also been claimed that the Ottoman front line infantry battalions were \"operating at about half strength.\" The 21st Infantry Regiment on 26 October, according to the Turkish General Staff Archives was claimed to be \"at half strength in trained men\" and reinforcements were failing to keep up with \"sick and battle casualties.\" Their last battle had been a decisive victory seven months previous, in April, from behind strong fortifications. Captain H\u00fcseyin H\u00fcsn\u00fc Emir, Assistant Chief of Staff of the Yildirim Army Group, claimed the 16th Division which had 200 officers, 400 NCOs and 10,900 men in September 1916, had been reduced to only 5,017 officers and men by 15 October 1917. Then the \"three infantry battalions in its 78th Infantry Regiment numbered about 400 men each (out of an authorisation of about 750 men per battalion).\" He also claimed that every division in the Gaza defences was below strength by 50 per cent, but there is no mention of the establishment of assault battalions. In addition, chronic failures due to casualties and manpower shortages, were reported as being \"compounded by terrible attrition from disease and desertion.\" On 3 August 1917, the Yildirim Army Group reported \"a deficit of some 70,000 soldiers\", and that even the proposed reinforcements would leave them 40,000 short.<ref>Erickson 2007 pp. 105, 107\u20138, 109</ref> According to Hussein Husni's Yilderim, \"in September 1917 Mustafa Kemal, the commander of the Seventh army in Palestine, reported to Enver Pasha that 50 per cent of the arriving 54th division were either too young or old; [no source] a battalion of one of the best divisions left Istanbul 1,000 strong, only to arrive at Aleppo with 500 men. [note 76 Hussein Husni, Yilderim, Part 1, Chapter 4 (also appendix 16).] \"<ref>Hughes 1999 p. 55</ref>\n\nAccording to Massey, rations and leadership amongst the divisions facing the British Empire troops were also poor, writing \"if the...[Ottoman Army]...had been well led and properly rationed,\" the Ottoman 3rd, 7th, 16th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 26th, 27th, 53rd, and 54th Divisions and the 3rd Cavalry Division, should have been able to resist more strongly.<ref>Massey 1919 p. 12</ref>\n\n==== Gaza-Beersheba line ====\n[[File:Falls4GazBwest.JPG|thumb|Western section of the Gaza\u2013Beersheba Line]]\nAfter April, the defences at Gaza had been strengthened. Many of the houses were built on a ridge, each with its own garden surrounded by high cactus hedges, enclosing an area at least {{convert|1|mi|km}} deep. Along with this formidable area the {{convert|12000|yd|m}} of trenching west of the town needed to be attacked by infantry as Allenby did not have enough artillery to do the job.<ref>Massey 1919 p. 15</ref> Both Sheria and Beersheba were particularly strongly fortified by the Ottoman force, permanent strongly entrenched and wired positions were constructed from the sea at Gaza to Shellal on the Wadi Ghazzeh, defended by infantry.<ref name=\"Preston 1921 p. 12\">Preston 1921 p. 12</ref><ref name=\"Woodward 2006 pp. 87\u20138\">Woodward 2006 pp. 87\u20138</ref> An Ottoman appreciation stated that due to lack of water any attack on Beersheba could only be made by one cavalry and one infantry division.<ref name=\"Downes 1938 p. 661\">Downes 1938 p. 661</ref><ref group=\"Note\">Based on an 11 November 1917 report by Major Pardoe titled \"Turkish Machine Gun Defences and Emplacements\" it has been claimed \"Gaza's defences were so weak that Allenby should have concentrated his cavalry opposite Gaza and made his main attack there, and ignored or, at most, launched a diversionary attack on Beersheba.\" [Hughes 1999 p. 50]</ref>\n\nThe well-sited Ottoman defences relied on entrenched Ottoman soldiers ready to take every opportunity to counterattack. Both Gaza and Beersheba were virtually ringed by fortifications. An attack was expected by the EEF and the Ottoman Army knew about EEF preparations for an attack.<ref name=\"Erickson172\"/>\n\nThe strength of the Yildirim Army Group units holding the Gaza to Beersheba line was estimated at 40,000 rifles, although the figure was later found to be closer to 33,000 rifles, 1,400 sabres and 260 guns, including the reserve 19th Division at 'Iraq el Menshiye, and the 12th Depot Regiment at Hebron.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35\"/><ref group=\"Note\">These figures do not mention machine guns.

However strong defences had been developed to the west and south\u2013west of Beersheba with a garrison from the Seventh Army of 5,000 protecting its important wells,<ref name=\"Hill 1978 p. 120\"/> supported by a number of high entrenched hills around Beersheba.<ref>Massey 1919 p. 26</ref>\n\n[[File:Falls4GaBeeEast.jpg|thumb|Beersheba end of the Gaza\u2013Beersheba Line]]\nThe Seventh Army on the left, commanded by Fevzi Pasha was deployed \u2013\n:III Corps at Kauwukah or in XX Corps reserve near Kh.

The outer line circled the town from the Gaza to Beersheba road where the line passed through the high ground to the north\u2013west of Beersheba before continuing to the west and south\u2013west of Beersheba, to Ras Ghannam. Situated on average about {{convert|7000|yd|m}} from Beersheba, this semi\u2013circle of defences was heavily entrenched and wired. To the north\u2013east, east and south\u2013east the outer line of defences consisted of a series redoubts or strong posts on the high ground at Tel el Sakaty and Tel el Saba, along with two stone block\u2013houses defending the north bank of the Wadi Saba. The second inner line of defences completely encircled Beersheba the town itself, crossing the Wadi Saba just to the south of the railway bridge.<ref>Preston 1921 p. 20</ref>\nBefore the battle, Kress von Kressenstein recommended that the wells at Beersheba be destroyed and the garrison withdrawn to the hills north of the town, because he considered there were not enough troops to successfully defend Beersheba. He argued that from the hills to the north, the Beersheba garrison could attack the flank of any EEF units moving against Hareira and Sheria, but von Falkenhayn rejected this advice.<ref>Keogh 1955 p. 140</ref>\n\n=== Attacking force ===\nThe EEF had been reorganized and strengthened during the [[Stalemate in Southern Palestine]] to overcome the strongly reinforced and entrenched Ottoman forces holding the Gaza to Beersheba line.<ref>Blenkinsop 1925 p.199</ref> Allenby was directed by the [[War Cabinet]] to \"strike the Turks as hard as possible,\" and defeat hostile forces wherever they opposed the EEF. He was to commence the offensive as \"early as possible in September\" before the Ottoman Army could redeploy their forces after the [[Russian Revolution|withdrawal of Russia]] from the war. Robertson assured Allenby was assured that \"everything possible\" was being done to bring the EEF back to full strength and fully supplied with munitions. However there was \"no prospect at present of being able to send you the further reinforcements ... required for operations beyond the line Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem.\"<ref>Robertson [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] to Allenby 10 August quoted in Hughes 2004 p. 52</ref> By this time the EEF was competing for finite British resources, which were being restricted by the very successful German submarine attacks which destroyed British ships and supplies, with the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] which had commenced on 31 July.

From Mulebbis to the sea the river was between {{convert|40|-|50|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|10|-|12|ft|m}} deep except for the ford at the mouth known as Sheik Muanis.

An offensive to push the Ottoman Army further northwards away from the city was planned for 24 December 1917, but was delayed due to bad weather.<ref>Bruce 2002, p. 168</ref> So the EEF was prepared for battle when the Ottoman Army launched their counterattack at 01:30 on 27 December.

This Ottoman attack on Tell el Ful initially drove the British outposts back and captured several important places. However, the engagement continued for two days and was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Keogh186\"/> A general EEF infantry advance on a {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} front moved their front line {{convert|6|mi|km}} northwards on the right and {{convert|3|mi|km}} on the left.<ref name=\"Bruce169\">Bruce 2002 p. 169</ref> They pushed the whole line along the Nablus road to beyond Ramallah and Bireh by 30 December.<ref name=\"Keogh186\"/><ref name=\"Grainger223\">Grainger 2006 p. 223</ref> Final objectives were gained and the line along the whole front secured.<ref name=\"Wavell_171-2\">Wavell 1968 pp 171\u20132</ref> In the middle of February 1918 the line was extended eastwards to Jericho in the Jordan Valley, when it was finally secured on the Dead Sea.<ref>Jerusalem Memorial 1928, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Summation of offensive===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1205 On the way to Jerusalem \u05d1\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jaffa to Jerusalem train climbing the Judean hills east of [[Lod|Lydda]] in 1947]]\nThe EEF had evolved into a \"genuinely imperial all\u2013arms force\"<ref name=\"Bou 2009 p. 171\"/> and the offensive was a \"nearly ideal instance of the proper use of all arms in combination.\"<ref name=\"Major General M.

Fought in Flanders from 20 to 30 November, it ended with heavy losses and no territorial gains. The French army was still recovering from a serious mutiny, while the Italians were defeated at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], and [[Russia]] was out of the war following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army.<ref name=\"Woodward 2006, p. 156\"/> These substantial victories of the EEF's campaign from October to December 1917 resulted in the first military defeat of a Central Power, which led to a substantial loss of enemy territory. In particular the fighting from 31 October to 7 November against the Ottoman Gaza\u2013Sheria\u2013Beersheba line resulted in the first defeat of strongly entrenched, experienced and, up until then, successful Ottoman armies which were supported by artillery, machine guns and aircraft.<ref>Grainger 2006, p. 230</ref>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/first_world_war/subclass.asp?levelID=1454\n| title     = 11th Light Horse Regiment War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 10-16-26\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra\n}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/first_world_war/subclass.asp?levelID=1454\n| title     = 12th Light Horse Regiment War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 10-17-10\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1465\n| title     = 4th Light Horse Brigade War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 10-4-11\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1840\n| title     = New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade Headquarters War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 35-1-31\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1342\n| title     = Australian Mounted Division General Staff War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 1-58-4 Part 1, 4, 1-58-5\n| date      = October\u2013November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra\n}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1239|title=Australian Mounted Division Train War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 25-20-1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n| date      = June, July, August, September, October\u2013November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra\n}}\n* {{cite web\n| url   = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1362\n| title = Egyptian Expeditionary Force General Staff Headquarters War Diary |work=First World War Diaries AWM4, 1-6-19 Part 2 |date=November 1917 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |location=Canberra}}\n* {{cite book|title=Jerusalem Memorial Bearing the Names of Soldiers of the Forces of the British Empire Who Fell in Egypt and Palestine During the Great War and Have No Known Graves|year=1928|volume=Part 1 A-L|publisher=Imperial War Graves Commission|location=London|oclc=221064848}}\n* {{cite book |last=Baly |first=Lindsay|title=Horseman, Pass By: The Australian Light Horse in World War I |year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=East Roseville, Sydney |oclc=223425266}}\n* {{cite book|title=History of the Great War Based on Official Documents Veterinary Services|editor-last1=Blenkinsop|editor-first1= Layton John|editor-last2=Rainey|editor-first2=John Wakefield|year=1925|publisher=H.M.

After the capture of [[Beersheba]], by the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF), the [[Gaza City|Gaza]] to Beersheba line became increasingly weakened and, seven days later, the EEF successfully forced the [[Ottoman Turkish Empire]]'s [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Seventh]] and [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Armies]] to withdraw. During the following seven days of pursuit, the Turkish forces were pushed back to [[Jaffa]]. There followed three weeks of hard fighting in the [[Judean Hills]] before [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem was captured]] on 9 December 1917. During five and a half weeks of almost continuous offensive operations, the EEF captured {{convert|47.5|mi|km}} of territory.\n\nAfter a joint attack by the [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX]] and the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], Beersheba at the eastern end of the Gaza to Beersheba line, was captured. The next day, on 1 November, the [[Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe]] began, with an advance north of Beersheba into the Judean foothills, by the [[53rd (Welsh) Division|53rd (Welsh)]] and the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]]s. This move up the road from Beersheba to [[Jerusalem]], also threatened [[Hebron]] and [[Bethlehem]]. Then, during the night of 1/2 November, the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] took place on the [[Mediterranean]] coast, when limited attacks by the [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]] were made against strongly held, formidable defences. The next day, the fiercely contested fighting south of Tel el Khuweilfe by the EEF was not designed to capture [[Hebron]], but to create sufficient area for the deployment of the XX Corps, for a [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] attack on the central defences of the old Gaza to Beersheba line. Fighting for the Beersheba to Jerusalem road, also encouraged the Turkish commanders to deploy their reserves, to hold the EEF threat. On 6 November the [[Battle of Hareira and Sheria]] was launched on the centre of the old line, half-way between Gaza and Beersheba, and Hareira was captured; but it was not until late the next day, that the Sheria position was finally captured by the [[60th (London) Division]], after a failed [[Charge at Sheria|charge]] by the [[4th Light Horse Brigade]] ([[Australian Mounted Division]]). The Seventh and the Eighth Armies were by now in full retreat from the remains of the old Gaza to Beersheba line.\n\nOn 7 November, the second day of the battle for Hareira and Sheria, the [[52nd (Lowland) Division]] and the [[Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade]] advanced  unopposed through Gaza to attack strong rearguard positions at Wadi el Hesi, which were [[Capture of Wadi el Hesi|captured the next day]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Stalemate in Southern Palestine}}\n[[File:Falls SkBEasternDesertDet.jpeg|thumb|On the edge of the Eastern Desert]]\n\nAfter the first two battles for Gaza, it was obvious to British commanders that large reinforcements were needed \"to set General Murray's army in motion again.\"<ref>Wavell 1968 p. 89</ref> Indeed, Murray made it clear to the [[War Cabinet]] and the [[Imperial General Staff]] early in May, that he could not invade Palestine without reinforcements.<ref>Keogh 1955 p. 122</ref> The War Office assured him in the same month, that he should prepare to receive reinforcements, which would bring the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF) up to six infantry and three mounted divisions.<ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 360</ref> However by July, when [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Edmund Allenby]] took command of the EEF, 5,150 infantry and 400 yeomanry reinforcements were still needed after the casualties suffered during the battles for Gaza.<ref>Allenby to Robertson 12 July 1917 in Hughes 2004 pp. 34\u20135</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 1917 summer in the northern hemisphere, the political and the strategic interests of the British government and the EEF coincided. This was due in part to the failure on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[French Republic]]'s [[Nivelle offensive]] and the success of the [[German Empire|German]] submarine campaign against [[British Empire]] shipping.<ref name=\"Downes660\">Downes 1938 p. 660</ref> The destruction of British shipping caused severe shortages in Britain, and although the [[United States of America]] had entered the war, their military support would not be apparent for some time. Britain was about to enter a fourth year of extremely costly war, and their [[Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], appreciated the need to take into account the [[Home front during World War I|\"Home Front]].\" He believed a striking military success could bolster the morale of the civil population, and he told Allenby that \"he wanted Jerusalem as a Christmas present for the British nation.\" Lloyd Gorge made clear that this victory was needed in order \"to strengthen the staying power and morale\" of Britain.<ref>Wavell 1968 p. 96</ref> The British [[War Cabinet]] needed a successful Palestine offensive at a time when there was not much good news coming out of the Western Front, and when it was beginning to look like the war could extend into 1919. If they could capture Jerusalem this would put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which could in turn place a strain on the German alliance, at the same time enhancing Britain's long term aim of strengthening their influence in the Middle East. By the end of October, the EEF was ready to attack.<ref name=\"Downes660\"/><ref name=\"Bruce 2002 p. 116\">Bruce 2002 p. 116</ref>\n\nThe decision to launch a major offensive in Palestine, in the autumn of 1917, was also based on \"very sound strategical reasons.\" The collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in the spring led to the withdrawal of Russia from the war, as a consequence of the [[Russian Revolution]], and freed up large numbers of Ottoman Empire troops, which had been fighting the Russians on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. These Ottoman units became available to reinforce the Palestine front and were in the process of assembling near Aleppo, along with German soldiers and equipment. They were to launch operations to recapture [[Baghdad]], which had been [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|captured by the British in March]]. The threat to Baghdad could be more economically opposed by an EEF offensive in southern Palestine. Rather than sending reinforcements to General [[Frederick Stanley Maude|Frederick S. Maude]]'s [[Mesopotamia]]n army holding Baghdad, British reinforcements from the [[Salonika front]], which the [[War Office]] wanted to scale down, would strengthen the EEF.<ref name=\"Wavell96\u20137\">Wavell 1968 pp. 96\u20137</ref>\n\nAllenby's strategical objective was a defeat of the Ottoman army in Southern Palestine, decisive enough to ensure Ottoman reinforcements destined for Baghdad were diverted to Palestine.<ref name=\"Wavell96\u20137\"/> However, by 5 October, General [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]], telegraphed Allenby that the War Cabinet desired him to eliminate the Ottoman Empire out of the war by a \"heavy defeat\", followed by the occupation of the Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem line. He was to be supplied with \"fresh British divisions ... at the rate of one every sixteen days.\" It was not until after the launching of the offensive that Allenby was told such increases to his force were improbable.<ref name=\"Falls27\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 27</ref>\n\n[[File:AWMJ02971WadiGhuzze.jpg|thumb|A military railway bridge over the Wadi Ghazzeh, with water storage beyond. EEF horses watered in this vicinity during September and October 1917]]\n\nAllenby estimated the Ottoman Army could have 20 divisions, with no more than 12 on the front line. However, as these could be replaced by the Ottoman Army, the EEF could not field more than 14 divisions after the doubling of the railway line from  [[El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya|Kantara]], because of the limitations of the EEF's [[lines of communication|supply lines]].<ref name=\"Falls27\"/> Between April and October 1917, both the EEF and the Ottoman Army laid railways and water pipe lines, and sent troops, guns and huge quantities of ammunition to the front.<ref>Cutlack 1941 p. 64</ref> By mid-October 1917, a staff appreciation from London acknowledged the strength of the Ottoman defenders in Southern Palestine, and that any attempt to dislodge them from the Gaza to Beersheba line could cost three divisions. The appreciation acknowledged that \"[T]he Turk is a stubborn fighter in trenches and we must expect that in any event he will stand long enough to cause us serious loss ... we must be prepared to supply General Allenby with three more divisions\" to relieve weakened divisions.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 124</ref>\n\n=== Battlefield ===\nThe Gaza to Beersheba line was defended by both sides during the [[Stalemate in Southern Palestine]] from April to the end of October 1917. The EEF front line extended for {{convert|22|mi|km}} from the Mediterranean coast at Gaza to a point on the [[Wadi Ghazza|Wadi Ghazzeh]] near El Gamli, about {{convert|14|mi|km}} south-west of Sharia and {{convert|18|mi|km}} west of Beersheba on the southern edge of the plain of [[Philistia]]. On the coast, a strip of sand dunes varying between {{convert|2|\u2013|4|mi|km}} wide was impassable for wheeled vehicles. Between the sand dunes and the Judean Hills, which rise to {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, the mainly undulating \"down-land\" plains stretched between {{convert|15|and|20|mi|km}} wide. The plains were intersected by many wadis, which transformed into \"raging torrents,\" rushing down from the bare rocky Judaean mountains during the wet winters. The region was sparsely populated, with each village depending on its well for water, while crops of barley were grown. From this area, the topographical conditions of the plain are unchanged for {{convert|80|mi|km}} northwards, becoming the Plain of Sharon from Jaffa, to finally end at [[Mount Carmel]] near [[Haifa]].<ref name=\"Blenkinsop 1925 p. 200\">Blenkinsop 1925 p. 200</ref>\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe Ottoman Army in Palestine commanded by [[Marshal]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] was nearly 50,000 strong, while General Allenby\u2019s EEF was 76,000 strong.<ref>Jerusalem Memorial 1928 p. 9</ref>\n\n=== Defending force ===\nUntil June 1917, Sheria was the headquarters of the German-commanded defenders holding the Gaza-Beersheba line.<ref>Cutlack 1941 p. 57 note</ref> In August 1917, the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fourth Army]] was structured as:\n* Fourth Army (Syria-Palestine)\n*** 3rd Cavalry Division\n** VIII Corps\n*** 48th Division\n** XII Corps\n*** 23rd Division\n*** 44th Division\n** [[XV Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XV Corps]]\n*** 43rd Division\n** [[XX Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XX Corps]]\n*** 16th Division\n*** 54th Division\n** [[XXII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XXII Corps]]\n*** 3rd Division\n*** 7th Division\n*** 53rd Division<ref name=\"Erickson 2001 p. 170\">Erickson 2001 p. 170</ref>\n\nThe Fourth Army in Palestine was reorganised into two corps, the XX Corps was expanded from the 16th and 54th Infantry Divisions to include the 178th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Cavalry Division, while the XXII Corps' three divisions remained unchanged.<ref name=\"Erickson 2001 p. 163\">Erickson 2001 p. 163</ref> The XX Corps was headquartered at  [[Huj, Gaza|Huj]], while the XXII Corps defended Gaza with the 3rd and 53rd Divisions.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 35</ref> By July the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eighth Army]] commanded by [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]] consisting of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division, had an estimated strength of 46,000 rifles, 28,000 sabres and 200 guns.<ref name=\"Hill 1978 p. 120\">Hill 1978 p. 120</ref><ref>Bruce 2002 p. 115</ref>\n\n==== Yildirim Army Group ====\n[[File:ArabCamelCorps.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Arab Camel Corps]]\nGermany had suggested that six or seven Ottoman divisions released as a consequence of the Russian Army's withdrawal from the war, should attack Mesopotamia with German support. Germany would supply ammunition, equipment, troops and gold along with one of Germany's \"most distinguished soldiers\", Erich von Falkenhayn, and an Army Headquarters staff. These German reinforcements included the German Asia Corps, three battalion groups of \"handpicked and thoroughly trained\" infantry, very strongly supported by artillery, machine guns, mortars, aircraft and mechanical transport. The Ottoman Empire would contribute a new Seventh Army made up of divisions transferred from the Caucasus and the Balkan fronts.<ref>Keogh 1955 pp. 129\u201330</ref>\n\nFollowing the formation of the Yildirim Army Group in June 1917, substantial forces were deployed to Syria and Palestine, where they continued to hold the Fourth Army defences. Already in Palestine were the 3rd, 7th, 16th, and 54th Infantry Divisions while the 26th 27th, and 53rd Infantry Divisions arrived during the summer. The 3rd, 7th 16th, and 26th Infantry Divisions had fought in the Gallipoli campaign and the 3rd Cavalry Division had fought in the Caucasian Campaigns. These seven infantry divisions and one cavalry division formed the recently activated Ottoman Eighth Army.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 102</ref><ref name=\"Erickson172\">Erickson 2001 p. 172</ref>\n\nOn establishment, the Yildirim Army Group consisted of Ottoman Army troops already in Palestine and Mesopotamia. These included the 19th and the 20th Divisions from Galicia, the 24th and the 42nd Divisions from the Dardanelles, the 48th Division from the Caucasus, the 50th Division from Macedonia and the 59th from Adana in the Gulf of Iskanderun. The 1st and 11th Divisions were also transferred from the Caucasus to the Yildirim Army Group, arriving in time for the attempt to retake Jerusalem at the end of December, and in March 1918 respectively.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 24\">Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 24</ref><ref group=\"Note\">While the 19th and 24th Divisions arrived before the battles for the Gaza to Beersheba line, the 20th Division arrived in time for the defence of Jerusalem, the 48th Division arrived soon after the loss of Jerusalem.

The two 3rd Cavalry Division regiments in the area had 1,400 sabres, while the third regiment of the division was deployed east of the Jordan River.<ref name=\"Falls42n\"/> These rifle figures at 30 September overlook the 25% of rifles of each infantry battalion, which were progressively replaced with machine guns, beginning on 10 August 1917.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 103</ref>\n\nBy mid-September 1917 the Ottoman Army had decided against the attempt to retake Baghdad. [[Enver Pasha]] took von Falkenhayn's advice to send the Yildirim Army Group to Palestine, to face the growing threat reported by Kress von Kressenstein. Enver Pasha issued orders on 26 September for the Fourth Army headquarters to move to Damascus, at the same time dividing the area in half, leaving Cemal Pasha with responsibility for Syria and western Arabia. On 2 October, Enver Pasha activated the new Eighth Army, commanded by Kress von Kressenstein, and deployed it along with the Seventh Army, commanded by Mustafa Kemal, to the Yildirim Army Group, commanded by von Falkenhayn. However, in late September Mustafa Kemal disagreed with some of Enver Pasha's decisions and the new command structure. He advised adopting a defensive military policy, in response to the superior British lines of communications, which would ensure continued numerical superiority in any contested theatre. He thought this imbalance would make it impossible for the Yildirim Army Group to go on the offensive. He advised merging the Seventh and the Eighth Armies, offering to step down in favour of Kress von Kressenstein. Several weeks later Mustafa Kemal resigned and Fevzi Pasa took command of the Seventh Army which was still assembling near Aleppo.<ref>Erickson 2001 p. 171, 2007 p. 115</ref> By October 1917 the headquarters of the Eighth Army commanded by Kress von Keressenstein was at [[Huleikat]] to north of Huj.<ref>Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 36</ref>\n\nThese massive reorganisations began to be implemented in October, but by the end of the month, only the headquarters of the Seventh and Eighth Armies were in position to take the field.<ref>Erickson 2001 171\u20132</ref> On 1 October, the Eighth Army consisted of 2,894 officers, 69,709 men, 29,116 rifles, 403 machine guns, 268 artillery pieces, and 27,575 animals.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 128</ref> Between 10 and 28 October 1917, the Eighth Army shifted three infantry divisions to reserve positions, although the defence of Beersheba remained the responsibility of the Ottoman III Corps, consisting of the mainly Arab 27th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Infantry Regiment \"minus its machine guns,\" with the two regiments of the 3rd Cavalry Division.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 p. 117\">Erickson 2007 p. 117</ref>\n\nOn 28 October, orders were issued by von Falkenhayn's Yildirim Army Group headquarters, directing Kress von Kressenstein's Eighth Army to assume responsibility for the western, or Gaza half, of the Ottoman front line, while Fevzi Pasa's Seventh Army took responsibility for the eastern half including Beersheba. The III Corps headquarters which commanded the 27th Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division was transferred from the Eighth to the Seventh Army. The 16th and 24th Infantry Divisions and the 19th Infantry Division on its way south were also assigned to the Seventh Army.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 pp. 115\u20136\">Erickson 2007 pp. 115\u20136</ref> Both the 19th and 24th Divisions arrived before the battle began.<ref name=\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 24\"/> Kress von Kressenstein later described the 27th Infantry Division defending Beersheba, as 'badly trained, badly organised, and composed of Arabs who had to be watched'. He recommended the division be deactivated and its soldiers deployed elsewhere as reinforcements. He suggested the 19th Infantry Division, Mustafa Kemal's \"famous Gallipoli division,\" replace it at Beersheba.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 p. 117\"/> Regarded by the Ottoman General Staff as the most powerful infantry division in the Ottoman Army's order of battle, the 19th Division which had also served in Galicia, had an unusually powerful artillery component. The commander of the Yildirim Army Group, von Falkenhayn, ordered the 19th Infantry Division moved into reserve near Cemame [Jemame?] nearer to Gaza than Beersheba.<ref name=\"Erickson 2007 p. 117\"/>\n\nBy 31 October, nine Ottoman infantry divisions and one cavalry division with a total strength of up to 45,000 rifles, 1,500 sabres and 300 guns defended the Gaza to Beersheba line. Gaza was defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps, with its XX Corps defending Sheria, while the Seventh Army's III Corps defended Beersheba. The recently arrived commander of the Seventh Army, Fevzi Pasha, \"played no active role in command during the early stages of the third battle of Gaza and the entire front remained under Kress's control.\"<ref>Bruce 2002 p. 125</ref>\n\n==== Assault battalions ====\nEach infantry division was reorganised into three infantry regiments, each consisting of three infantry battalions, and one assault battalion. The specialised assault or [[Stormtrooper|storm troop]] divisions of the German Army were never formed by the Ottoman Army.<ref>Erickson 2007 pp. 104\u20135</ref> However, the assault battalions were established by order of Enver Pasha on 1 September 1917, during a general activation of ''Sto\u00dftruppen'' style assault troops, across the whole Ottoman Army. The XV Corps, the First Army and the Fourth Army established the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Assault Battalions respectively. In addition, Enver Pasha ordered each infantry division in the Yildirim Army Group and in the Fourth Army, to establish assault detachments consisting of the best officers, NCOs, and men from the best units in the division. These soldiers were required to be 27 years old or younger, intelligent, healthy and strong. Each assault unit was given a one-month assault course, better rations, and a badge embroidered with a hand grenade.<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 104</ref>\n\n==== Aircraft ====\nDuring October, 56 aircraft in Nos. 301, 302, 303 and 304 Squadrons of the German Flying Corps, arrived in Palestine from Germany. At the time No. 14 (Ottoman) Squadron's A.E.G. two-seaters, were stationed at Kutrani.<ref>Cutlack 1941 p. 81</ref>\n\n====Characteristics====\nIt has also been claimed that after \"Russia's collapse in 1917\" that reinforcements needed in Palestine were sent to the Caucasus, leaving the Ottoman army low in morale. In describing the situation, Hughes writes that \"many had received no mail from home in years. The hapless Turkish recruits awaited the EEF assault in 'fragile tents' with 'nothing to cheer their spirits'.\"<ref>Hughes 1999 p. 51</ref> This was because \"the condition of the Ottoman railway system was such that the Turks had difficulty maintaining any substantial force in Palestine either for defensive or offensive operations.\" Based on a single track for 1,275 miles, with sections of standard and narrow gauge, the Ottoman lines of communication have been described as \"appalling.\"<ref>Hughes 1999 p. 54</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Army in Palestine in 1917 continued to demonstrate most of the characteristics they had during the first two years of war. The army was operationally and tactically aggressive, executing both defensive and offensive operations and training continuously in realistic, up-to-date methods at troop level and in centralised settings. According to Erickson, \"[d]ivisions were task-organised\" for a variety of \"specific tactical missions.\" The commanders were experienced, highly trained and capable leaders who \"continued to function well in its third year of a multi-front total war.\"<ref>Erickson 2007 p. 109</ref>\n\nHowever, it has also been claimed that the Ottoman front line infantry battalions were \"operating at about half strength.\" The 21st Infantry Regiment on 26 October, according to the Turkish General Staff Archives was claimed to be \"at half strength in trained men\" and reinforcements were failing to keep up with \"sick and battle casualties.\" Their last battle had been a decisive victory seven months previous, in April, from behind strong fortifications. Captain H\u00fcseyin H\u00fcsn\u00fc Emir, Assistant Chief of Staff of the Yildirim Army Group, claimed the 16th Division which had 200 officers, 400 NCOs and 10,900 men in September 1916, had been reduced to only 5,017 officers and men by 15 October 1917. Then the \"three infantry battalions in its 78th Infantry Regiment numbered about 400 men each (out of an authorisation of about 750 men per battalion).\" He also claimed that every division in the Gaza defences was below strength by 50 per cent, but there is no mention of the establishment of assault battalions. In addition, chronic failures due to casualties and manpower shortages, were reported as being \"compounded by terrible attrition from disease and desertion.\" On 3 August 1917, the Yildirim Army Group reported \"a deficit of some 70,000 soldiers\", and that even the proposed reinforcements would leave them 40,000 short.<ref>Erickson 2007 pp. 105, 107\u20138, 109</ref> According to Hussein Husni's Yilderim, \"in September 1917 Mustafa Kemal, the commander of the Seventh army in Palestine, reported to Enver Pasha that 50 per cent of the arriving 54th division were either too young or old; [no source] a battalion of one of the best divisions left Istanbul 1,000 strong, only to arrive at Aleppo with 500 men.

They knew that if the EEF was delayed more than 48 hours without water it the pursuit would have to stop so strong rearguards were established to allow their infantry to withdraw well ahead of the slower British infantry.

This fell on units of the 60th (London) Division holding the Nablus road.<ref name=\"Keogh186\">Keogh 1955, p. 186</ref><ref>Woodward 2006, p. 152</ref> The initial objective of the Ottoman attack, was a line of villages, including Nebi Samweil {{convert|1|mi|km}} in front of their starting positions.<ref>Grainger 2006, pp. 222\u20133</ref> Their focus was towards [[Tell el-Ful|Tell el Ful]], a hill east of the Nablus road about {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of Jerusalem defended by the 60th (London) Division. This Ottoman attack on Tell el Ful initially drove the British outposts back and captured several important places. However, the engagement continued for two days and was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Keogh186\"/> A general EEF infantry advance on a {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} front moved their front line {{convert|6|mi|km}} northwards on the right and {{convert|3|mi|km}} on the left.<ref name=\"Bruce169\">Bruce 2002 p. 169</ref> They pushed the whole line along the Nablus road to beyond Ramallah and Bireh by 30 December.<ref name=\"Keogh186\"/><ref name=\"Grainger223\">Grainger 2006 p. 223</ref> Final objectives were gained and the line along the whole front secured.<ref name=\"Wavell_171-2\">Wavell 1968 pp 171\u20132</ref> In the middle of February 1918 the line was extended eastwards to Jericho in the Jordan Valley, when it was finally secured on the Dead Sea.<ref>Jerusalem Memorial 1928, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Summation of offensive===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1205 On the way to Jerusalem \u05d1\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jaffa to Jerusalem train climbing the Judean hills east of [[Lod|Lydda]] in 1947]]\nThe EEF had evolved into a \"genuinely imperial all\u2013arms force\"<ref name=\"Bou 2009 p. 171\"/> and the offensive was a \"nearly ideal instance of the proper use of all arms in combination.\"<ref name=\"Major General M. G p. 676\"/> The scale of the enormous territorial gains of the Southern Palestine offensive, contrasted with the British offensive on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]]. Fought in Flanders from 20 to 30 November, it ended with heavy losses and no territorial gains. The French army was still recovering from a serious mutiny, while the Italians were defeated at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], and [[Russia]] was out of the war following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army.<ref name=\"Woodward 2006, p. 156\"/> These substantial victories of the EEF's campaign from October to December 1917 resulted in the first military defeat of a Central Power, which led to a substantial loss of enemy territory. In particular the fighting from 31 October to 7 November against the Ottoman Gaza\u2013Sheria\u2013Beersheba line resulted in the first defeat of strongly entrenched, experienced and, up until then, successful Ottoman armies which were supported by artillery, machine guns and aircraft.<ref>Grainger 2006, p. 230</ref>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/first_world_war/subclass.asp?levelID=1454\n| title     = 11th Light Horse Regiment War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 10-16-26\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra\n}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/war_diaries/first_world_war/subclass.asp?levelID=1454\n| title     = 12th Light Horse Regiment War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 10-17-10\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1465\n| title     = 4th Light Horse Brigade War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 10-4-11\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1840\n| title     = New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade Headquarters War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 35-1-31\n| date      = November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1342\n| title     = Australian Mounted Division General Staff War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 1-58-4 Part 1, 4, 1-58-5\n| date      = October\u2013November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra\n}}\n* {{cite web\n| url       = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1239|title=Australian Mounted Division Train War Diary\n| work      = First World War Diaries AWM4, 25-20-1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n| date      = June, July, August, September, October\u2013November 1917\n| publisher = Australian War Memorial\n| location  = Canberra\n}}\n* {{cite web\n| url   = http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm4/subclass.asp?levelID=1362\n| title = Egyptian Expeditionary Force General Staff Headquarters War Diary |work=First World War Diaries AWM4, 1-6-19 Part 2 |date=November 1917 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |location=Canberra}}\n* {{cite book|title=Jerusalem Memorial Bearing the Names of Soldiers of the Forces of the British Empire Who Fell in Egypt and Palestine During the Great War and Have No Known Graves|year=1928|volume=Part 1 A-L|publisher=Imperial War Graves Commission|location=London|oclc=221064848}}\n* {{cite book |last=Baly |first=Lindsay|title=Horseman, Pass By: The Australian Light Horse in World War I |year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=East Roseville, Sydney |oclc=223425266}}\n* {{cite book|title=History of the Great War Based on Official Documents Veterinary Services|editor-last1=Blenkinsop|editor-first1= Layton John|editor-last2=Rainey|editor-first2=John Wakefield|year=1925|publisher=H.M.
