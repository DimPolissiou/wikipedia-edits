It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun 'Gay' Dhawan]], [[Shraddha 'Nepotism Product' Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Porkistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly.

Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect.

The area is surrounded with medicinal herbs and plants. At the top of the hill there is historic Shiva Lingam, which dates back at least 500 years.\n\nThe famous Lord Murugan temple (Vellimalai Murugan Temple) is located in the mountain which is away from 45 minutes climbing over the valley.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nMuch of the Sirumalai is covered by deciduous forests - the lower slopes by dry deciduous and the higher slopes and riverine valleys by moist and wet deciduous forests. Trees such as [[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]] , [[Shorea]] , [[Magnolia champaca]] are dominant in these hills. Other rare plants such as [[Liana]]<nowiki/>s and [[Orchids]] also occur in the higher elevation evergreen tracts. [[Coffee]] estates form a major portion of present-day landscape. These Reserve Forests are protected under [[Tamil Nadu Forest Department]].\n\nA rich animal life including threatened animals such as [[Slender loris]], [[Gaur]], [[Sambar deer]], [[Sloth bear]], [[Asian palm civet]], [[Indian hare]], [[Jungle cat]] and [[Indian pangolin]] are to be seen in the wild. Birds such as [[Indian peafowl]], [[Asian koel]], [[Indian grey hornbill]] and even the endemic [[Blue-winged parakeet]] are found in these forests. Threatened reptiles such as the [[Python molurus]], [[Indian star tortoise]], and venomous snakes such as [[Indian cobra]], [[Russell's viper]], [[Common krait]] and the endemic [[Bamboo pit viper]] and the little-known striped coral snake [[Calliophis nigrescens]] are found here. Lizards such as the [[Bengal monitor]], the [[Indian chameleon]], the flying lizard or [[Draco dussumieri]], [[Calotes calotes]], [[Ophisops minor]] and [[Cnemaspis]] geckoes are to be seen here. Special mention must be made of the only endemic reptile of the hill - the Sirumalai [[Shieldtail Snake]] [[Uropeltis dindigalensis]], that is reportedly not found anywhere else. Rare and endemic amphibians such as [[Hylarana]], [[Indirana]], [[Zakerana brevipalmata]] and the direct-developing bush frog [[Pseudophilautus wynaadensis]] occur here. A myriad forms of lesser-known [[Insect]]<nowiki/>s and [[Moth]]<nowiki/>s etc. are present.\n\n== Agathya Puram ==\nLocated in Sirumalai is Agathya Puram. Named after the prominent [[Agathya]] [[Siddhar]]. Located in Agathya Puram is Silver Hill, this is a hill in Sirumalai. A madeup story is that the peak of the Silver hill was made up of Silver but to avoid man's destruective actions during the [[Kali Yuga]] the hill was transformed via [[Alchemy]] in to stone by [[Agathya]] Siddhar, hence it got the name silver hill. But please understand the story is only told so folks will look at the beauty of the hills.\n\n== Agatthiyar SivaSakthi Sitthar Peedam ==\n\nAgatthiyar SivaSakthi Sitthar peedam is an [[ashram]] located at the silver hill in Agathya Puram. Food is served daily (Annadanam), lodging is available at the ashram. The ashram aims to promote various voluntary campaigns such as cleaning of the hills.\n[[File:SirumalaiRoad.JPG|thumb|right|Road view from Sirumalai View Point]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Sirumalai}}\n* [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Sirumalai&w=all&s=int Images of Sirumalai]\n* [http://www.traveltoonsindia.com/Sirumalai.html About Sirumalai]\n* [http://wikimapia.org/9259183/Sirumalai Sirumalai Map]\n* Ganesh, S.

The famous Sirumalai banana is slowly disappearing from disease, which scientists have been unable to prevent.<ref>{{cite web|author=J Arockiaraj |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-06/madurai/34293562_1_banana-cultivation-banana-varieties-farmers-face |title=Diseases, low prices affect production of hill bananas |publisher=Times of India |date=2012-10-06 |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref>\n\nMan-made fires on the hills have destroyed medicinal plants and threatened the fauna habitat.

The area is surrounded with medicinal herbs and plants. At the top of the hill there is historic Shiva Lingam, which dates back at least 500 years.\n\nThe famous Lord Murugan temple (Vellimalai Murugan Temple) is located in the mountain which is away from 45 minutes climbing over the valley.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nMuch of the Sirumalai is covered by deciduous forests - the lower slopes by dry deciduous and the higher slopes and riverine valleys by moist and wet deciduous forests. Trees such as [[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]] , [[Shorea]] , [[Magnolia champaca]] are dominant in these hills. Other rare plants such as [[Liana]]<nowiki/>s and [[Orchids]] also occur in the higher elevation evergreen tracts. [[Coffee]] estates form a major portion of present-day landscape. These Reserve Forests are protected under [[Tamil Nadu Forest Department]].\n\nA rich animal life including threatened animals such as [[Slender loris]], [[Gaur]], [[Sambar deer]], [[Sloth bear]], [[Asian palm civet]], [[Indian hare]], [[Jungle cat]] and [[Indian pangolin]] are to be seen in the wild. Birds such as [[Indian peafowl]], [[Asian koel]], [[Indian grey hornbill]] and even the endemic [[Blue-winged parakeet]] are found in these forests. Threatened reptiles such as the [[Python molurus]], [[Indian star tortoise]], and venomous snakes such as [[Indian cobra]], [[Russell's viper]], [[Common krait]] and the endemic [[Bamboo pit viper]] and the little-known striped coral snake [[Calliophis nigrescens]] are found here. Lizards such as the [[Bengal monitor]], the [[Indian chameleon]], the flying lizard or [[Draco dussumieri]], [[Calotes calotes]], [[Ophisops minor]] and [[Cnemaspis]] geckoes are to be seen here. Special mention must be made of the only endemic reptile of the hill - the Sirumalai [[Shieldtail Snake]] [[Uropeltis dindigalensis]], that is reportedly not found anywhere else. Rare and endemic amphibians such as [[Hylarana]], [[Indirana]], [[Zakerana brevipalmata]] and the direct-developing bush frog [[Pseudophilautus wynaadensis]] occur here. A myriad forms of lesser-known [[Insect]]<nowiki/>s and [[Moth]]<nowiki/>s etc. are present.\n\n== Agathya Puram ==\nLocated in Sirumalai is Agathya Puram. Named after the prominent [[Agathya]] [[Siddhar]]. Located in Agathya Puram is Silver Hill, this is the tallest hill in Sirumalai. It is said that the peak of the Silver hill was made up of Silver but to avoid man's destruective actions during the [[Kali Yuga]] the hill was transformed via [[Alchemy]] in to stone by [[Agathya]] Siddhar, hence it got the name silver hill. The hills silver glitter can be still seen in the sun light. In the peak of this Silver hill is a 500-year-old [[Shiva]] [[Lingam]], walk to top of the hill is about 30 \u2013 45 minutes. The view from the silver Hill is breathtaking.\n\n== Agatthiyar SivaSakthi Sitthar Peedam ==\n\nAgatthiyar SivaSakthi Sitthar peedam is an [[ashram]] located at the silver hill in Agathya Puram. Food is served daily (Annadanam), lodging is available at the ashram. The ashram aims to promote various voluntary campaigns such as cleaning of the hills.\n[[File:SirumalaiRoad.JPG|thumb|right|Road view from Sirumalai View Point]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Sirumalai}}\n* [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Sirumalai&w=all&s=int Images of Sirumalai]\n* [http://www.traveltoonsindia.com/Sirumalai.html About Sirumalai]\n* [http://wikimapia.org/9259183/Sirumalai Sirumalai Map]\n* Ganesh, S.

The investigation into his death point towards the Tiger Soup as a possible cause of death and its manufacturer, Raghuvir \"Raghu\" Mehta who surrenders himself to the authorities. \n\nOver a flashback, it is shown that Raghu has been a failed Gujarati entrepreneur who lives with his wife Rukmini and his son Chintu. He struggles to come up with a profitable business idea and have cycled through several products which have failed to take off. His uncle forces him to go on a trip to China with his cousin Devraj where he is to meet investors about a sports drink business. In China, Devraj presents his product to Tanmay, a successful Gujrati entrepreneur, who rejects it. Despondent Devraj abandons Raghu to his own devices. He strikes up a bond with Tanmay who explains that customer's needs are akin to a lock and Raghu must find the key to that lock in order to be a successful businessman. Raghu goes on a drunken binge with Devraj's contact Xiu Li and in stupor, commits to meet her boss Hao Li while posing as Devraj.\n\nDuring the meeting, Hao introduces Raghu to Tiger Penis Soup which is the Chinese equivalent of Viagra. Hao proposes that Raghu shall sell this product in India and suggests that it will be successful over there because Chinese and Indians are constantly thinking about sex. While researching the market in India, Raghu realizes that there is no genuine solution available for sexual problems faced by men. Raghu proposes a business partnership to Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi, a sexologist whose book have impressed Raghu, but Vardhi initially rejects the offer. Meanwhile, Raghu's inability to provide a steady income for his family creates tension between him and Rukmini. Raghu proceeds to recruit Vardhi with the promise of spreading sex awareness to the public and eventually Vardhi agrees. Back in the present, General Zeng's autopsy is held up in diplomatic red tape, forcing the investigators into trying to get to the truth through Raghu. \n\nRewinding to the past, Raghu puts together a team of talented young professionals to handle manufacturing and distribution of the product. After some initial struggles, Raghu meets Tanmay who suggests Vardhi as the face of their product. The team arranges a seminar but Vardhi accidentally walks into a parent-teacher conference; his impassioned plea to make sexual discourse normal in society goes viral. As a result, the Tiger Soup business is wildly successful. However, Raghu hides the product from Rukmini and his extended family who think that he is running a business related to Chinese fans. Devraj soon finds out that the Tiger Soup is behind the success of Raghu. Raghu meets with Abhay Chopra, a successful investor and motivational speaker, who is in league with Devraj. Chopra proposes a business partnership but Raghu rejects the proposal. In retaliation, Devraj reveals to the family that Raghu is running the ostensibly disreputable Tiger Soup business. \n\nChintu is expelled from his school when a bottle of Tiger Soup is found in his bag. When Rukmini finds out that Raghu lied about his business, she confronts him about it. A distressed Raghu goes to Vardhi to end their partnership but a timely call from Tanmay causes him to reconsider. Back to the present, Raghu and Vardhi appear before a preliminary commission consisting of several government agencies to explain their role in Zeng's death. Raghu reveals that there is no secret ingredient in the soup, it is just Rabdi, an Indian dessert, and implies that most sexual issues are more psychological than biological. Dr. Vardhi appeals to the commission not to consider sex as a taboo topic and encourages them to let the product continue instead of banning it. However, while bureaucratic pressures from the Chinese delegation force the commission to ban the Tiger Soup for some time, Raghu and Vardhi are acquitted and convey to the media that they are happy that the product was not banned completely. \n\nAt the end, Raghu is shown as a successful owner of a chain of sexual health-related clinics with Dr. Vardhi as the face of the business and he is invited to a premier business school to give a lecture on being an entrepreneur. Rukmini is overwhelmed at the success of her husband and the achievements he has made. Raghu ends with the catchphrase \"Customer is chutiya\" .\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Raghuvir \"Raghu\" Mehta\n* [[Mouni Roy]] as Rukmini Mehta\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi\n* [[Abhishek Banerjee (actor)|Abhishek Banerjee]] as Investigator Sharma\n* [[Amyra Dastur]] as Rupali Bansal\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as Tanmay Shah\n* [[Gajraj Rao]] as Abhay Chopra\n* [[Sumeet Vyas]] as Devraj\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as Vhinde Bhai\n* [[Amit Bimrot]] as Ravi Panchal\n* Ragi Jani as Kannudo\n* [[Chittaranjan Tripathy]] as Investigator Gupta\n* [[Bijou Thaangjam]] as Chinese Official\n* [[Shraddha Musale]] as Anchor at Award Ceremony\n* [[Sachin-Jigar|Jigar Saraiya]] in a special appearance in the opening sequence as the musician\n\n==Production ==\nThe film was announced in June 2018 with [[Mouni Roy]] and [[Rajkummar Rao]] in lead roles, to be directed by [[Mikhil Musale]].

M. Vetticad]] of ''[[Firstpost]]'' gave two-star out of five and opined that the film had 'tonal and logical inconsistency in the narrative.' She noted that the film was a drag on long stretches, and the storytelling lacked liveliness. However, praising the performance of Rao and Roy, Vetticad concluded, \"Made In China fails to hit the bull's eye because it sorely needed an evening out of pace and tone, depth of characterisation and detailing in the plotline. The best thing about it are Rao and Irani, who are a pleasure to watch even in this middling affair.\".<ref name=\"cr1:fp\">{{cite news|first=Anna |last=M. M.

The investigation into his death point towards the Tiger Soup as a possible cause of death and its manufacturer, Raghuvir \"Raghu\" Mehta who surrenders himself to the authorities. \n\nOver a flashback, it is shown that Raghu has been a failed Gujarati entrepreneur who lives with his wife Rukmini and his son Chintu. He struggles to come up with a profitable business idea and have cycled through several products which have failed to take off. His uncle forces him to go on a trip to China with his cousin Devraj where he is to meet investors about a sports drink business. In China, Devraj presents his product to Tanmay, a successful Gujrati entrepreneur, who rejects it. Despondent Devraj abandons Raghu to his own devices. He strikes up a bond with Tanmay who explains that customer's needs are akin to a lock and Raghu must find the key to that lock in order to be a successful businessman. Raghu goes on a drunken binge with Devraj's contact Xiu Li and in stupor, commits to meet her boss Hao Li while posing as Devraj.\n\nDuring the meeting, Hao introduces Raghu to Tiger Penis Soup which is the Chinese equivalent of Viagra. Hao proposes that Raghu shall sell this product in India and suggests that it will be successful over there because Chinese and Indians are constantly thinking about sex. While researching the market in India, Raghu realizes that there is no genuine solution available for sexual problems faced by men. Raghu proposes a business partnership to Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi, a sexologist whose book have impressed Raghu, but Vardhi initially rejects the offer. Meanwhile, Raghu's inability to provide a steady income for his family creates tension between him and Rukmini. Raghu proceeds to recruit Vardhi with the promise of spreading sex awareness to the public and eventually Vardhi agrees. Back in the present, General Zeng's autopsy is held up in diplomatic red tape, forcing the investigators into trying to get to the truth through Raghu. \n\nRewinding to the past, Raghu puts together a team of talented young professionals to handle manufacturing and distribution of the product. After some initial struggles, Raghu meets Tanmay who suggests Vardhi as the face of their product. The team arranges a seminar but Vardhi accidentally walks into a parent-teacher conference; his impassioned plea to make sexual discourse normal in society goes viral. As a result, the Tiger Soup business is wildly successful. However, Raghu hides the product from Rukmini and his extended family who think that he is running a business related to Chinese fans. Devraj soon finds out that the Tiger Soup is behind the success of Raghu. Raghu meets with Abhay Chopra, a successful investor and motivational speaker, who is in league with Devraj. Chopra proposes a business partnership but Raghu rejects the proposal. In retaliation, Devraj reveals to the family that Raghu is running the ostensibly disreputable Tiger Soup business. \n\nChintu is expelled from his school when a bottle of Tiger Soup is found in his bag. When Rukmini finds out that Raghu lied about his business, she confronts him about it. A distressed Raghu goes to Vardhi to end their partnership but a timely call from Tanmay causes him to reconsider. Back to the present, Raghu and Vardhi appear before a preliminary commission consisting of several government agencies to explain their role in Zeng's death. Raghu reveals that there is no secret ingredient in the soup, it is just Rabdi, an Indian dessert, and implies that most sexual issues are more psychological than biological. Dr. Vardhi appeals to the commission not to consider sex as a taboo topic and encourages them to let the product continue instead of banning it. However, while bureaucratic pressures from the Chinese delegation force the commission to ban the Tiger Soup for some time, Raghu and Vardhi are acquitted and convey to the media that they are happy that the product was not banned completely. \n\nAt the end, Raghu is shown as a successful owner of a chain of sexual health-related clinics with Dr. Vardhi as the face of the business and he is invited to a premier business school to give a lecture on being an entrepreneur. Rukmini is overwhelmed at the success of her husband and the achievements he has made. Raghu ends with the catchphrase \"Customer .....\" .\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Raghuvir \"Raghu\" Mehta\n* [[Mouni Roy]] as Rukmini Mehta\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Dr. Tribhuvan Vardhi\n* [[Abhishek Banerjee (actor)|Abhishek Banerjee]] as Investigator Sharma\n* [[Amyra Dastur]] as Rupali Bansal\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as Tanmay Shah\n* [[Gajraj Rao]] as Abhay Chopra\n* [[Sumeet Vyas]] as Devraj\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as Vhinde Bhai\n* [[Amit Bimrot]] as Ravi Panchal\n* Ragi Jani as Kannudo\n* [[Chittaranjan Tripathy]] as Investigator Gupta\n* [[Bijou Thaangjam]] as Chinese Official\n* [[Shraddha Musale]] as Anchor at Award Ceremony\n* [[Sachin-Jigar|Jigar Saraiya]] in a special appearance in the opening sequence as the musician\n\n==Production ==\nThe film was announced in June 2018 with [[Mouni Roy]] and [[Rajkummar Rao]] in lead roles, to be directed by [[Mikhil Musale]].

M. Vetticad]] of ''[[Firstpost]]'' gave two-star out of five and opined that the film had 'tonal and logical inconsistency in the narrative.' She noted that the film was a drag on long stretches, and the storytelling lacked liveliness. However, praising the performance of Rao and Roy, Vetticad concluded, \"Made In China fails to hit the bull's eye because it sorely needed an evening out of pace and tone, depth of characterisation and detailing in the plotline. The best thing about it are Rao and Irani, who are a pleasure to watch even in this middling affair.\".<ref name=\"cr1:fp\">{{cite news|first=Anna |last=M. M.
