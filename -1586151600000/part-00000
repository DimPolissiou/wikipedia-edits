Nicknamed \"The Grinder\" because of his slow, determined style of play, he won the [[World Snooker Championship]] in [[1980 World Snooker Championship|1980]], defeating [[Alex Higgins]] 18\u201316 in the final to become the first world champion in the sport's modern era from outside the [[United Kingdom]]. He remains the only world champion from the [[Americas]].\n\nThorburn was runner-up in two other World Championships, losing 21\u201325 to [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] in the [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] final (the first ever played at Sheffield's [[Crucible Theatre]]) and 6\u201318 to [[Steve Davis]] in the [[1983 World Snooker Championship|1983]] final. One of his most celebrated moments came during his second-round encounter with [[Terry Griffiths]] in 1983, when he became the first player to compile a [[maximum break]] in a World Championship match. He was the second player (after Davis) to make a 147 break in professional competition.\n\nThorburn's other notable achievements include holding the [[List of world number one snooker players|number one ranking]] during the [[Snooker season 1981/1982|1981/82 season]] and winning the prestigious invitational [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] three times, in [[1983 Masters (snooker)|1983]], [[1985 Masters (snooker)|1985]], and [[1986 Masters (snooker)|1986]]. This made him the first player to win the Masters more than once and the first to retain the title.\n\nHe retired from the professional tour in 1996 and was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2001.<ref name=\"ca\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/five-enter-canada-s-sports-hall-1.258115|title=Five enter Canada's Sports Hall|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=February 18, 2019}}</ref> At the age of 70, he won the [[2018 Seniors Masters]] at the Crucible Theatre, becoming the oldest player to win a world seniors title.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nThorburn first went to [[England]] to play snooker professionally in the early 70s. He had met [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] in [[Canada]], who had advised him to go to the UK to improve his game. He was soon considered a contender for tournaments, and finished runner-up in the world championship in 1977.\n\n===1980s===\nCliff Thorburn met [[Alex Higgins]] in the final of the [[1980 World Snooker Championship|1980 World Championship]]. He won the match 18\u201316 to take the championship,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/23112009/58/cliff-thorburn.html |title=Then and Now: Cliff Thorburn |date=17 November 2009 |publisher=[[Eurosport]] |website=Yahoo!

The [[BBC]]'s coverage of the final had been interrupted by the broadcast of live footage of the [[Iranian Embassy Siege|SAS storming the Iranian Embassy]]. The following season, Thorburn reached number one in the [[Snooker world rankings 1981/1982|world rankings]].\n\nIn 1983, Thorburn was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]]. That same year, he became the first player to make a [[maximum break]] at the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. He compiled the break in the fourth frame of his second round match against [[Terry Griffiths]] (a match he went on to win 13\u201312). While he was completing the break, play stopped on the tournament's second table because his friend and fellow Canadian [[Bill Werbeniuk]] wanted to watch. He subsequently went on to reach the final, but lost to then world number 1 [[Steve Davis]]. His wife had a miscarriage during his semi-final, but Thorburn refused to blame this for his loss, instead saying that he was fatigued after his three back-to-back final-frame victories: a 13\u201312 win over Terry Griffiths in the second round; another 13\u201312 win over [[Kirk Stevens]] in the quarter finals; and a gruelling 16\u201315 victory (from 13\u201315 behind) in his semi-final against [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]], which finished at 2:30am and left him physically exhausted before the final which commenced later that same day. He stated that, after finishing the semi-final in the early hours of the morning, he simply had nothing left for the final less than thirteen hours later against the in-form Steve Davis, who eventually defeated him 18\u20136, with a session to spare.\n\nThorburn was a three-time champion of [[Masters (snooker)|The Masters]], the most prestigious non-ranking event on the snooker calendar for many years, during its tenure at the Wembley Conference Centre near London, England. He defeated [[Ray Reardon]] 9\u20137 in the [[1983 Masters (snooker)|1983]] final, [[Doug Mountjoy]] 9\u20136 in [[1985 Masters (snooker)|1985]], and [[Jimmy White]] 9\u20135 in [[1986 Masters (snooker)|1986]]. He became the first player ever to retain the Masters title.\n\nHe enjoyed a resurgence in form during the [[Snooker season 1984/1985|1984/1985 season]]. He made the final of the [[1984 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], where he lost to [[Dennis Taylor]] 2\u201310. In the semi-final, Thorburn had unexpectedly beaten tournament favourite Steve Davis 9\u20137. He also made the final of the [[1985 Classic (snooker)|Classic]] in January 1985, where he met [[Willie Thorne]] in the final, with Thorne winning 13\u20138. Thorburn was again runner-up in the [[1986 Classic (snooker)|1986 Classic]], this time losing to Jimmy White in the final 12\u201313. Thorburn looked certain to win the title but White got a snooker in the deciding frame on the final pink and potted pink and black to win the title.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThorburn enjoyed success in the [[1985 Scottish Masters|1985]] and [[1986 Scottish Masters|1986]] Scottish Masters, an invitational event which opened the snooker season. He defeated Willie Thorne 9\u20137 in the 1985 final, and Alex Higgins 9\u20138 the following year. He won the opening ranking event in the [[Snooker season 1985/1986|1985/1986 snooker calendar]], the [[1985 Matchroom Trophy|Matchroom Trophy]], where he beat Jimmy White in the final 12\u201310, having trailed 0\u20137 and 4\u20138. He was then runner-up in the same event the following two seasons.\n\n===Later years===\n\nThorburn last qualified for the World Championship in [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994]], where he faced [[Nigel Bond]] in the first round. Thorburn led by 9\u20132 but eventually lost 9\u201310. In 2001, he was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"ca\" /> The same year he won the pro-am [[Canadian Amateur Championship (snooker)]]; he had previously won the tournament in 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977.<ref name=\"cbsa.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsa.ca/cbsa-champions-list.php |title=CBSA Champions & Runner-Ups |date=2009 |publisher=Canadian Billiards & Snooker Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715130006/https://www.cbsa.ca/cbsa-champions-list.php |archive-date=15 July 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006 World Championship]], Thorburn flew to Sheffield to unveil a life-size painting of the first televised maximum break that he made at the tournament in 1983.

Nicknamed \"The Grinder\" because of his slow, determined style of play, he won the [[World Snooker Championship]] in [[1980 World Snooker Championship|1980]], defeating [[Alex Higgins]] 18\u201316 in the final to become the first world champion in the sport's modern era from outside the [[United Kingdom]]. He remains the only world champion from the [[Americas]]. \n\nThorburn was runner-up in two other World Championships, losing 21\u201325 to [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] in the [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] final (the first ever played at Sheffield's [[Crucible Theatre]]) and 6\u201318 to [[Steve Davis]] in the [[1983 World Snooker Championship|1983]] final. One of his most celebrated moments came during his second-round encounter with [[Terry Griffiths]] in 1983, when he became the first player to compile a [[maximum break]] in a World Championship match. He was the second player (after Davis) to make a 147 break in professional competition.\n\nThorburn's other notable achievements include holding the [[List of world number one snooker players|number one ranking]] during the [[Snooker season 1981/1982|1981/82 season]] and winning the prestigious invitational [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] three times, in [[1983 Masters (snooker)|1983]], [[1985 Masters (snooker)|1985]], and [[1986 Masters (snooker)|1986]]. This made him the first player to win the Masters more than once and the first to retain the title. \n\nHe retired from the professional tour in 1996 and was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2001.<ref name=\"ca\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/five-enter-canada-s-sports-hall-1.258115|title=Five enter Canada's Sports Hall|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=February 18, 2019}}</ref> At the age of 70, he won the [[2018 Seniors Masters]] at the Crucible Theatre, becoming the oldest player to win a world seniors title.\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nThorburn first went to [[England]] to play snooker professionally in the early 70s. He had met [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] in [[Canada]], who had advised him to go to the UK to improve his game. He was soon considered a contender for tournaments, and finished runner-up in the world championship in 1977.\n\n===1980s===\nCliff Thorburn met [[Alex Higgins]] in the final of the [[1980 World Snooker Championship|1980 World Championship]]. He won the match 18\u201316 to take the championship,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/23112009/58/cliff-thorburn.html |title=Then and Now: Cliff Thorburn |date=17 November 2009 |publisher=[[Eurosport]] |website=Yahoo!

The [[BBC]]'s coverage of the final had been interrupted by the broadcast of live footage of the [[Iranian Embassy Siege|SAS storming the Iranian Embassy]]. The following season, Thorburn reached number one in the [[Snooker world rankings 1981/1982|world rankings]].\n\nIn 1983, Thorburn was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]]. That same year, he became the first player to make a [[maximum break]] at the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. He compiled the break in the fourth frame of his second round match against [[Terry Griffiths]] (a match he went on to win 13\u201312). While he was completing the break, play stopped on the tournament's second table because his friend and fellow Canadian [[Bill Werbeniuk]] wanted to watch. He subsequently went on to reach the final, but lost to then world number 1 [[Steve Davis]]. His wife had a miscarriage during his semi-final, but Thorburn refused to blame this for his loss, instead saying that he was fatigued after his three back-to-back final-frame victories: a 13\u201312 win over Terry Griffiths in the second round; another 13\u201312 win over [[Kirk Stevens]] in the quarter finals; and a gruelling 16\u201315 victory (from 13\u201315 behind) in his semi-final against [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]], which finished at 2:30am and left him physically exhausted before the final which commenced later that same day. He stated that, after finishing the semi-final in the early hours of the morning, he simply had nothing left for the final less than thirteen hours later against the in-form Steve Davis, who eventually defeated him 18\u20136, with a session to spare.\n\nThorburn was a three-time champion of [[Masters (snooker)|The Masters]], the most prestigious non-ranking event on the snooker calendar for many years, during its tenure at the Wembley Conference Centre near London, England. He defeated [[Ray Reardon]] 9\u20137 in the [[1983 Masters (snooker)|1983]] final, [[Doug Mountjoy]] 9\u20136 in [[1985 Masters (snooker)|1985]], and [[Jimmy White]] 9\u20135 in [[1986 Masters (snooker)|1986]]. He became the first player ever to retain the Masters title.\n\nHe enjoyed a resurgence in form during the [[Snooker season 1984/1985|1984/1985 season]]. He made the final of the [[1984 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], where he lost to [[Dennis Taylor]] 2\u201310. In the semi-final, Thorburn had unexpectedly beaten tournament favourite Steve Davis 9\u20137. He also made the final of the [[1985 Classic (snooker)|Classic]] in January 1985, where he met [[Willie Thorne]] in the final, with Thorne winning 13\u20138. Thorburn was again runner-up in the [[1986 Classic (snooker)|1986 Classic]], this time losing to Jimmy White in the final 12\u201313. Thorburn looked certain to win the title but White got a snooker in the deciding frame on the final pink and potted pink and black to win the title.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\nThorburn enjoyed success in the [[1985 Scottish Masters|1985]] and [[1986 Scottish Masters|1986]] Scottish Masters, an invitational event which opened the snooker season. He defeated Willie Thorne 9\u20137 in the 1985 final, and Alex Higgins 9\u20138 the following year. He won the opening ranking event in the [[Snooker season 1985/1986|1985/1986 snooker calendar]], the [[1985 Matchroom Trophy|Matchroom Trophy]], where he beat Jimmy White in the final 12\u201310, having trailed 0\u20137 and 4\u20138. He was then runner-up in the same event the following two seasons.\n\n===Later years===\n\nThorburn last qualified for the World Championship in [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994]], where he faced [[Nigel Bond]] in the first round. Thorburn led by 9\u20132 but eventually lost 9\u201310. In 2001, he was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"ca\" /> The same year he won the pro-am [[Canadian Amateur Championship (snooker)]]; he had previously won the tournament in 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977.<ref name=\"cbsa.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsa.ca/cbsa-champions-list.php |title=CBSA Champions & Runner-Ups |date=2009 |publisher=Canadian Billiards & Snooker Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715130006/https://www.cbsa.ca/cbsa-champions-list.php |archive-date=15 July 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006 World Championship]], Thorburn flew to Sheffield to unveil a life-size painting of the first televised maximum break that he made at the tournament in 1983.

The literary works of the [[Sangam period]], namely Akamkrithikal, Pathittipattu and Chilppathikaram, depict the ancient policing system. The feudal system which existed in ancient Kerala gave way to a new structure under the Cheras, comprising Thara, Desomand Nadu ruled by Madampi, Desavazhi and Naduvazhi respectively. The semblance of a modern police force was created in the late 19th century in [[Travancore]] under the British rule. There was no unified geographical entity as 'Kerala' before 1956. The present Kerala Police Department was formed in the same year by re-organizing and merging of police forces in Travancore-Cochin States and the British [[Malabar region|Malabar]] State.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police in ancient Kerala|url=http://keralapolice.gov.in/kerala-police/history/police-in-ancient-kerala|website=keralapolice.gov.in|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Modern Police|url=http://keralapolice.gov.in/kerala-police/history/modern-police|website=keralapolice.gov.in|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nState police Chief is an IPS official with the rank of [[Director general of police]].

Arcadia has a dense history from generations of human settlements.<ref name=\":6\" /> MacKay-Lyons was strongly influenced by the region's history, Maritime landscape, architecture and functionalist design. He studied architecture at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (graduating 1978). During his first year of his undergraduate education, he was compelled to quit, though eventually decided to stay after being convinced by his professor, Larry Richards. Following the completion of his degree, he partnered with Larry Richards and Eric Fiss to form a practice called 'Networks'. He later pursued his Master's in Architecture and Urban Design from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he worked closely on Urban Design projects with [[Barton Myers]] and [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]]. During his graduate education he became a teachers assistant, which inspired him to eventually become a professor.

The vernacular has also shaped his view on sustainability, which he considers to be largely cultural.

He is dedicated to building at least one project a year under $100,000 to stay connected to his democratic ideals and vernacular methods. MacKay-Lyons believes that architecture can only be successful when it is both accessible and affordable.<ref name=\":03\" /> He desires to make buildings that are ''more silent but have more to say.''<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n<br />\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Local Architecture'' (2015), [[Princeton Architectural Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-616-89128-2}}\n* ''Ghost: Building an Architectural Vision'' (2008), [[Princeton Architectural Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-568-98736-1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mackay-Lyons, Brian}}\n[[Category:Canadian architects]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Acadian descent]]\n[[Category:People from Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox architect\n|name= Brian MacKay-Lyons\n|image= \n|caption= \n|nationality= [[Canadians|Canadian]] \n|birth_date= {{birth date and age|1954|8|26|df=y}}\n|birth_place= [[Arcadia, Nova Scotia|Arcadia]], Nova Scotia, Canada\n|death_date=\n|death_place= \n|alma_mater= Technical University of Nova Scotia , [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. \n|practice= \n|significant_buildings= [[Dalhousie Faculty of Computer Science]] (1999), [[Ship's Company Theatre]], [[Parrsboro, Nova Scotia]] (2004) and the Canadian High Commission in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (2005)\n|significant_projects=\n|significant_design=\n|awards= [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Medal]] for architecture, [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada|RAIC Gold Medal]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian MacKay-Lyons wins 2015 RAIC Gold Medal|url=http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/brian-mackay-lyons-wins-2015-raic-gold-medal/1003472395/?&er=NA|accessdate=6 March 2015|work=Canadian Architect|date=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n'''Brian Mackay-Lyons''' (born 26 August 1954<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/brian-mackay-lyons/ | title=Brian Mackay-Lyons | work=The Canadian Encyclopedia | first1=David | last1=Monteyne | first2=Marc | last2=Boutin | date=17 April 2011 | accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref>) is a Canadian architect best known for his designs for houses on the coast of his native [[Nova Scotia]], and his use of Atlantic Canadian [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] materials and construction techniques.
