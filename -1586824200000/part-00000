Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).  In addition to the classic and Best-Picture-Academy-Award winning ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]], her notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), with [[Gregory Peck]], and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), opposite [[Cary Grant]].\n\nIn 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed.  She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), the debut film for Yul Brynner, winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1958, she starred for a second time with Cary Grant, this time in the popular romantic comedy ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]''.\n\nIn her later years, she won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation) in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late-Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. She died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.<ref name=James>{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}</ref> In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O.

He wanted Ingrid to become an opera star and, during his lifetime, had her take voice lessons for three years. But she said she always \"knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress,\" sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|upright|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934), at age 19]]\nAfter her father's death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who died of heart disease only six months later. Ingrid then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. She would also visit with another aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called \"Mutti,\" according to family legend.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}\n\nLater, Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1935), although she reportedly had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[Intermezzo]]'' (1936) which is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her, and ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]]'', which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).\n\n==Hollywood period: 1939\u20131949==\n===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===\nBergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), an English language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Ingrid: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick.\"\n\nBergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\".<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind'', our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick\", Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135\u2013136}}}}\n\n''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said \"She is sensational\", as an actress. This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", writes ''Life'', adding that workmen go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n===''Casablanca'' (1942)===\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]\nAfter the onset of World War II, Bergman \"felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds, \"Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi extermination camps]]\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293\u2013295}} In 1945, she and her first husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, who wed on 10 July 1937 in [[St\u00f6de]],<ref name=\"auto2\"/> became United States citizens.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAfter completing a final film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (''[[Adam Had Four Sons]]'', ''[[Rage in Heaven]]'', and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', all 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by [[Paul Henreid]], an \"anti-Nazi underground hero\" who is in [[Casablanca]], a haven from the Nazis.<ref name=Chandler/> Bergman did not consider ''Casablanca'' to be one of her favorite performances. \"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ingridbergman.com/|title=Ingrid Bergman - The Official Licensing Website of Ingrid Bergman|website=Ingrid Bergman|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> In later years, she stated, \"I feel about ''Casablanca'' that it has a life of its own.

For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film was taken from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|same title]] and co-starred [[Gary Cooper]]. When the book was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]], Hemingway stated that, \"Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part\". His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, ''Intermezzo'', although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her, he said, \"You ''are'' Maria!\".<ref name=LifeMag>Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean.

Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on [[DVD]].\n\nBetween motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to [[Europe]] for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Italian period with Rossellini: 1949\u20131957==\n[[File:Ingrid Bergman - 1954.JPG|thumb|left|In ''Fear'' (1954)]]\nBergman strongly admired two films by Italian [[Film director|director]] [[Roberto Rossellini]] that she had seen in the United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (\"Robin\") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).<ref name=Bondanella>Bondanella, Peter E.

She had played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and a virgin saint in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948).

Director [[Sidney Lumet]] offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role:\n{{quote|She had chosen a very small part, and I couldn't persuade her to change her mind. She was sweetly stubborn. But stubborn she was ... Since her part was so small, I decided to film her one big scene, where she talks for almost five minutes, straight, all in one long take. A lot of actresses would have hesitated over that.

She acted in each of these languages at various times. Fellow actor Sir [[John Gielgud]], who had acted with her in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'', and who had directed her in the play ''[[The Constant Wife]]'', playfully commented: \"She speaks five languages, and can't act in any of them.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Aug-26-Mon-2002/news/19489130.html|title=The Punch Line|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=26 August 2002|accessdate=22 October 2006}}</ref> (This is from a [[Dorothy Parker]] quote which became a [[snowclone]], \"That woman speaks eighteen languages, and can't say 'No' in any of them.\")\n\nAlthough known chiefly as a film star, Bergman strongly admired the great English stage actors and their craft. She had the opportunity to appear in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], working with such stage stars as Sir [[Michael Redgrave]] in ''A Month in the Country'' (1965), Gielgud in ''The Constant Wife'' (1973) and Dame [[Wendy Hiller]] in ''Waters of the Moon'' (1977\u20131978).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Films of Ingrid Bergman|last=Quirk|first=Lawrence|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York|pages=213, 221, 223}}</ref>\n\n===''Autumn Sonata'' (1978)===\nIn 1978, Bergman played in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (''H\u00f6stsonaten''), by [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation), for which she received her 7th\u2014and final\u2014Academy Award nomination. This was her final performance on the big screen. In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist who travels to [[Norway]] to visit her neglected daughter, played by [[Liv Ullmann]]. The film was shot in Norway. In 1979, Bergman hosted the AFI's Life Achievement Award Ceremony for [[Alfred Hitchcock]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== ''A Woman Called Golda'' (1982) ===\n[[File:MONI 051.jpg|thumb|Bergman in ''A Woman Called Golda'']]\nShe was offered the starring role in a television mini-series, ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982), about the late [[Israel]]i [[prime minister]] [[Golda Meir]]. It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. Her daughter Isabella described Bergman's surprise at being offered the part and the producer trying to explain to her, \"People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people.\" Isabella adds, \"Now, ''that'' was interesting to Mother.\" She was also persuaded that Golda was a \"grand-scale person\", one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was.

Insurance for Bergman was impossible. Not only did she have cancer, but it was spreading, and if anyone had known how bad it was, no one would have gone on with the project.\" After viewing the series on TV, Isabella commented,\n\n{{quote|She never showed herself like that in life.

The couple had one child, a daughter, [[Pia Lindstr\u00f6m|Friedel Pia Lindstr\u00f6m]] (born 20 September 1938). After returning to the United States in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with Pia. Lindstr\u00f6m stayed in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied medicine and surgery at the [[University of Rochester]]. Bergman traveled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in ''Life'' magazine, the \"doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully\". He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a \"professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood\". Lindstr\u00f6m later moved to [[San Francisco]], California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filming.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n\nOn 27 August 1945, two days before her 30th birthday, as Ingrid Lindstrom, she and her husband both filed \"[[Declaration of Intention]]\" forms with the United States District Court, Southern District of California. <ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://ancestrylibrary.proquest.com/aleweb/ale/do/login|title=Ancestry Library Edition|website=Ancestrylibrary.proquest.com|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring her marriage with Lindstr\u00f6m, Bergman had a brief affair with ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' co-star [[Gregory Peck]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Haney|first=Lynn|title=''Gregory Peck: A Charmed Life''|url={{Google books|YGqLGiJl69oC|page=PT31|keywords=ingrid%20bergman%20gregory%20peck|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=2009|isbn=9780786737819|publisher=De Capo Press}}</ref> Unlike her later affair with Rossellini, the affair with Peck was kept private until he confessed it to Brad Darrach of ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' in an interview five years after Bergman's death.

A week after her son was born, she divorced Lindstr\u00f6m and married Rossellini in Mexico. On 18 June 1952, she gave birth to the twin daughters Isotta Ingrid Rossellini and [[Isabella Rossellini]].

The rest were placed next to her parents' ashes in [[Norra Begravningsplatsen]] (Northern Cemetery), [[Stockholm]], Sweden.\n\nAccording to biographer [[Donald Spoto]], she was \"arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment\". After her American film debut in the film ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), co-starring [[Leslie Howard]], Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of make-up. Film critic [[James Agee]] wrote that she \"not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism\".<ref name=James/>\n\nAccording to film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], she \"always strove to be a 'true' woman\", and many filmgoers identified with her:{{quote|There was a time in the early and mid-1940s when Bergman commanded a kind of love in America that has been hardly ever matched.

Her roles have demanded an adaptability and sensitiveness of characterization to which few actresses could rise\".<ref name=LifeMag/>\n\nShe continued her acting career while suffering from cancer for eight years, and won international honors for her final roles. \"Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage\", adds Spoto.<ref name=Spoto/> Director [[George Cukor]] once summed up her contributions to the film media when he said to her, \"Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear?

Swedish actress who starred in a variety of European and American films, television movies, and plays.<ref name=\"WVobit\">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 1 September 1982.</ref> She won [[List of awards and nominations received by Ingrid Bergman|many accolades]], including three [[Academy Awards]], two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Tony Award]], four [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and a [[BAFTA Award]].\n\nBergman was born in [[Stockholm]] to a Swedish father and a German mother, and started her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939).  In addition to the classic and Best-Picture-Academy-Award winning ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]], her notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]; she won the award for ''Gaslight''. She made three films with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] including'' [[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), with [[Gregory Peck]], and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), opposite [[Cary Grant]].\n\nIn 1950, she starred in [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' (1954), now critically acclaimed.  She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), the debut film for Yul Brynner, winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1958, she starred for a second time with Cary Grant, this time in the popular romantic comedy ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]''.\n\nIn her later years, she won her third Academy Award, this one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], for her small performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). In 1978, she worked with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] (no relation) in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late-Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] in the television mini-series ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) for which she posthumously won her second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress. She died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress.<ref name=James>{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Pendergast|first2=Sara|last2=Pendergast|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|publisher=[[Gale Publishing]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|date=2000|isbn=1-55862-405-8|title-link=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture}}</ref> In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; [[David O. Selznick]] once called her \"the most completely conscientious actress\" he had ever worked with.

Her father, who was an artist and photographer, died when she was 13. He wanted Ingrid to become an opera star and had her take voice lessons for three years. But she always \"knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress\", sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>\n[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|upright|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934), at age 19]]\nAfter her father's death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who died of heart disease only six months later. She then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. Ingrid would also visit with another aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called \"Mutti,\" according to family legend.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}\n\nLater, Bergman received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}} During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in ''[[Munkbrogreven]]'' (1935), although she reportedly had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[Intermezzo]]'' (1936) which is graced by a leading performance by Ingrid Bergman (her first), in a role created especially for her, and ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]]'', which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).\n\n==Hollywood period: 1939\u20131949==\n===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===\nBergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'' (1939), an English language remake of her earlier Swedish film ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Ingrid: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick.\"\n\nBergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\".<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind'', our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick\", Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135\u2013136}}}}\n\n''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said \"She is sensational\", as an actress. This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", writes ''Life'', adding that workmen go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to ''Life'', the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\".<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}\n\n===''Casablanca'' (1942)===\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]\nAfter the onset of World War II, Bergman \"felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds, \"Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the [[Nazi concentration camp|Nazi extermination camps]]\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293\u2013295}} In 1945, she and her first husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, who wed on 10 July 1937 in [[St\u00f6de]],<ref name=\"auto2\"/> became United States citizens.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAfter completing a final film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (''[[Adam Had Four Sons]]'', ''[[Rage in Heaven]]'', and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', all 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by [[Paul Henreid]], an \"anti-Nazi underground hero\" who is in [[Casablanca]], a haven from the Nazis.<ref name=Chandler/> Bergman did not consider ''Casablanca'' to be one of her favorite performances. \"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ingridbergman.com/|title=Ingrid Bergman - The Official Licensing Website of Ingrid Bergman|website=Ingrid Bergman|accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> In later years, she stated, \"I feel about ''Casablanca'' that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled\".<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|88}}\n\n===''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943)===\nAfter ''Casablanca'', with \"Selznick's steady boosting\", she played the part of Maria in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), which was also her first color film. For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film was taken from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|same title]] and co-starred [[Gary Cooper]]. When the book was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]], Hemingway stated that, \"Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part\". His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, ''Intermezzo'', although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her, he said, \"You ''are'' Maria!\".<ref name=LifeMag>Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean.

The film, according to Thomson, \"was the peak of her Hollywood glory\".<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|77}} Bergman next played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), opposite [[Bing Crosby]], for which she received her third consecutive nomination for Best Actress.\n\n===''Saratoga Trunk'' (1945)===\nBergman also starred in ''[[Saratoga Trunk]]'' (1945), though the film was originally shot in 1943 but not released until 1945.<ref name=\"Bogle\">{{citation|last=Bogle|first=Donald|title=Heat Wave: The Life and Career of Ethel Waters|authorlink=Donald Bogle|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-124173-4|publisher=Harper-Collins|page=[https://archive.org/details/heatwavelifecare2011bogl/page/369 369]|url=https://archive.org/details/heatwavelifecare2011bogl/page/369}}</ref>\n\n===Hitchcock films===\nBergman starred in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949).

Ledger|accessdate=6 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Joan of Arc'' (1948)===\nBergman received another Best Actress nomination for ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), an independent film based on the Maxwell Anderson play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'', produced by [[Walter Wanger]], and initially released through [[RKO]]. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on [[DVD]].\n\nBetween motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to [[Europe]] for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Italian period with Rossellini: 1949\u20131957==\n[[File:Ingrid Bergman - 1954.JPG|thumb|left|In ''Fear'' (1954)]]\nBergman strongly admired two films by Italian [[Film director|director]] [[Roberto Rossellini]] that she had seen in the United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (\"Robin\") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).<ref name=Bondanella>Bondanella, Peter E. ''The Films of Robert Rossellini\", Cambridge University Press (1993)</ref>{{rp|18}}\n\nThis affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the [[United States Senate]].

She had played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), and a virgin saint in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948). Bergman later said, \"People saw me in ''Joan of Arc'', and declared me a saint. I'm not. I'm just a woman, another human being.\"<ref name=Spoto>Spoto, Donald. ''Notorious: The Life of Ingrid Bergman'', HarperCollins (1997), p. 300</ref>\n\nAs a result of the scandal, Bergman returned to Italy, leaving her husband and daughter Pia.

Director [[Sidney Lumet]] offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role:\n{{quote|She had chosen a very small part, and I couldn't persuade her to change her mind. She was sweetly stubborn. But stubborn she was ...

The couple had one child, a daughter, [[Pia Lindstr\u00f6m|Friedel Pia Lindstr\u00f6m]] (born 20 September 1938). After returning to the United States in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with Pia. Lindstr\u00f6m stayed in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied medicine and surgery at the [[University of Rochester]]. Bergman traveled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in ''Life'' magazine, the \"doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully\". He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a \"professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood\".

His mother rejected his male identity and continued referring to him as her daughter. On several occasions, Teena claimed to be [[intersex]].<ref name=\"trutv\" />\n\nTeena and his sister attended St. Mary's Elementary School and [[Pius X High School (Nebraska)|Pius X High School]] in Lincoln, where Teena was remembered by some as being socially awkward.<ref name=\"deceiver\"/> During his second year, Teena rejected Christianity after he protested to a priest at Pius X regarding Christian views on [[abstinence]] and [[Christianity and homosexuality|homosexuality]].<ref name=\"deceiver\"/> He also began rebelling at school by violating the school dress-code policy to dress in a more masculine fashion. During the first semester of his senior year, a U.S. Army recruiter visited the high school, encouraging students to enlist in the armed forces. Teena enlisted in the [[United States Army]] shortly after his eighteenth birthday, and hoped to serve a [[tour of duty]] in [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. However, he failed the written entrance exam by listing his sex as male.<ref name=\"deceiver\"/>\n\nIn December 1990, Teena went to Holiday Skate Park with his friends, [[breast binding|binding his breasts]] to [[passing (gender)|pass]] as a boy. The 18-year-old Teena went on a date with a 13-year-old girl. He also met the girl's 14-year-old friend, Heather,<ref name=\"deceiver\"/> and began regularly dressing as a male. In the months nearing his high school graduation, Teena became unusually outgoing and was remembered by classmates as a \"class clown\".<ref name=\"deceiver\"/> Teena also began skipping school and receiving failing grades, and was expelled from Pius X High School in June 1991, three days before high school graduation.<ref name=\"deceiver\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1991, Teena began his first major relationship, with Heather. Shortly after, Teena was first employed as a gas station attendant in an attempt to purchase a trailer home for himself and his girlfriend. His mother, however, did not approve of the relationship, and convinced her daughter to follow Teena in order to find out whether Teena's relationship with Heather was platonic or sexual.<ref name=\"deceiver\"/>\n\nIn January 1992, Teena underwent a [[psychiatric evaluation]], which concluded that Teena was suffering from a severe \"[[sexual identity]] crisis\".<ref name=\"deceiver\"/> He was later taken to the Lancaster County Crisis Center to ensure that he was not suicidal. He was released from the center three days later and began attending therapy sessions, sometimes accompanied by his mother or sister. He was reluctant to discuss his sexuality during these sessions but eventually revealed that he had been raped. The counseling sessions ended two weeks later.<ref name=\"deceiver\"/>\n\nIn 1993, after some legal trouble, Teena moved to the [[Falls City, Nebraska|Falls City]] region of [[Richardson County, Nebraska]], where he identified solely as a man. He became friends with several local residents. After moving into the home of Lisa Lambert, Teena began dating Lambert's friend, 18-year-old [[Lana Tisdel]] and began associating with ex-convicts John L.

Tisdel looked only when forced to and said nothing. Lotter and Nissen later assaulted Teena and forced her into a car. They drove to an area by a meat-packing plant in Richardson County, where they assaulted and gang-raped her. They then returned to Nissen's home where Teena was ordered to take a shower. Teena escaped from Nissen's bathroom by climbing out the window and went to Tisdel's house. He was convinced by Tisdel to file a police report, though Nissen and Lotter had warned Teena not to tell the police about the gang rape or they would \"silence her permanently\". Teena also went to the emergency room where a standard [[rape kit]] was assembled, but later lost. Sheriff Charles B. Laux questioned Teena about the rape; reportedly, he seemed especially interested in Teena's [[transsexual]]ity, to the point that Teena found his questions rude and unnecessary, and refused to answer. Nissen and Lotter learned of the report, and they began to search for Teena. They did not find her, and three days later, the police questioned them. The sheriff declined to have them arrested due to lack of evidence.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on December 31, 1993, Nissen and Lotter drove to Lambert's house and broke in. They found Lambert in bed and demanded to know where Teena was. Lambert refused to tell them. Nissen searched and found Teena under the bed.

Teena escaped from Nissen's bathroom by climbing out the window and went to Tisdel's house. He was convinced by Tisdel to file a police report, though Nissen and Lotter had warned Teena not to tell the police about the gang rape or they would \"silence him permanently\". Teena also went to the emergency room where a standard [[rape kit]] was assembled, but later lost. Sheriff Charles B.

Serbia offered material support to the [[Ilinden Uprising]] (1903),{{sfn|Biliarsky|2007|pp=316\u2013317}} and after its suppression, authorities in Belgrade sought but failed to negotiate with Bulgarian leaders on sending Serbian bands (''cheta'') into Macedonia for combined Serbian-Bulgarian action.

Hundreds of [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]] activists were murdered and thousands arrested in the period immediately following the war, and around 50,000 troops were stationed in Macedonia. Bands of Serbian Chetniks, including one led by Babunski, were organised to terrorise the population, kill pro-Bulgarian resistance leaders and recruit the local population into [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] for the army. Resistance by IMRO was met with further terror, which included the formation in 1922 of the [[Association against Bulgarian Bandits]] led by Pe\u0107anac and Ilija Trifunovi\u0107-Lune, based out of [[\u0160tip]] in eastern Macedonia.

This document continued additional formulations of strategy, including collaboration with Italian forces as a ''modus vivendi'', formation of Croatian Chetnik units as part of a continuing struggle against the Partisans, Domobrans and Usta\u0161e.

Uprisings in the areas of [[Battle of Loznica (1941)|Loznica]], [[Siege of Rogatica|Rogatica]], [[Capture of Banja Kovilja\u010da|Banja Kovilja\u010da]] and [[Capture of Olovo|Olovo]] lead to early victories. On 19 September 1941, Tito and Mihailovi\u0107 met for the first time in [[Struganik]] where Tito offered Mihailovi\u0107 the chief-of-staff post in return for the merger of their units. Mihailovi\u0107 refused to attack the Germans, fearing reprisals, but promised to not attack the Partisans.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=143}} According to Mihailovi\u0107 the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs at the published rate of 100 civilians for every German soldier killed, 50 civilians for every soldier wounded.{{sfn|Bailey|1998|p=80}} On 20 October, Tito proposed a 12-point program to Mihailovi\u0107 as the basis of cooperation. Six days later, Tito and Mihailovi\u0107 met at Mihailovi\u0107's headquarters where Mihailovi\u0107 rejected principal points of Tito's proposal including the establishment of common headquarters, joint military actions against the Germans and quisling formations, establishment of a combined staff for the supply of troops, and the formation of national liberation committees.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=143}} These disagreements lead to uprisings being quashed in [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|Montenegro]] and [[Battle for Novi Pazar|Novi Pazar]] due to poor coordination between the resistance forces. Mihailovi\u0107's fears for ongoing reprisals became a reality with two mass murder campaigns conducted against Serb civilians in [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]], reaching a combined death toll of over 4,500 civilians. Reprisals in the [[NDH]] were also in full swing with thousands of Serb civilians being killed by the [[Ustashe]].{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=17}} In late October, Mihailovi\u0107 concluded the Partisans, rather than Axis forces, were the primary enemies of the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=142}}\n\nReprisals against Serb civilians forced Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks to fight as a guerrilla territorial force, rather than a regular army.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=174}} While the Partisans opted for overt acts of sabotage that led to reprisals against civilians by Axis forces, the Chetniks opted for a more subtle form of resistance. Instead of detonating TNT to destroy railway tracks and disrupt Axis railway lines, Chetniks contaminated railway fuel sources and tampered with mechanical components, ensuring trains would either derail or breakdown at random times.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=178}} Martin suggests that these acts of sabotage significantly crippled supplies lines for the [[Afrika Korps]] fighting in North Africa.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=180}}\n\nOn 2 November, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks attacked [[Republic of U\u017eice|Partisan headquarters in U\u017eice]].

On 18 November, Mihailovi\u0107 accepted a truce offer from Tito though attempts to establish a common front failed.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=144}} That month, the British government, upon the request of the [[Yugoslav government-in-exile]], insisted Tito make Mihailovi\u0107 the commander-in-chief of resistance forces in Yugoslavia, a demand he refused.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=152}} [[File:DMihailovic poternica.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|German warrant for Mihailovi\u0107 offering a reward of 100,000 gold marks for his capture, dead or alive, 1943]]Partisan-Chetnik truces were repeatedly violated by the Chetniks, first with the killing of a local Partisan commander in October and then later, under orders of Mihailovi\u0107's staff, massacring 30 Partisan supporters, mostly girls and wounded individuals, in November. Despite this, Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia continued to cooperate for some time.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=152}}\n\nIn December 1941 the Yugoslav government-in-exile in [[London]] under [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] promoted Mihailovi\u0107 to Brigadier-General and named him commander of the Yugoslav Home Army.

According to new archival evidence, published in 1980 for the first time, some actions against Axis carried by Mihailovi\u0107 and his Chetniks, with British liaison officer Brigadier [[Charles Douglas Armstrong|Armstrong]], were mistakenly credited to [[TITO Josip Broz|Tito]] and his Communist forces.{{sfn|Tillotson|2011|p=155}} In the meantime, the Germans, also aware of the growing importance of Yugoslavia, decided to wipe out the Partisans with determined offensives. The Chetniks, by this time, had agreed to provide support for the German operations, and were in turn granted supplies and munitions to increase their effectiveness.\n\nThe first of these large anti-Partisan offensives was ''Fall Weiss'', also known as the [[Battle of Neretva]]. The Chetniks participated with a significant, 20,000-strong, force providing assistance to the German and Italian encirclement from the east (the far bank of the river [[Neretva]]). However, Tito's Partisans managed to break through the encirclement, cross the river, and engage the Chetniks. The conflict resulted in a near-total Partisan victory, after which the Chetniks were almost entirely incapacitated in the area west of the [[Drina]] river. The Partisans continued on, and later again escaped the Germans in the [[Battle of Sutjeska]]. In the meantime, the Allies stopped planning an invasion of the Balkans and finally rescinded their support for the Chetniks and instead supplied the Partisans.

This changed when the talks broke down, and they proceeded to attack the latter (who were actively fighting the Germans), while continuing to engage the Axis only in minor skirmishes. Attacking the Germans provoked strong retaliation and the Chetniks increasingly started to negotiate with them to stop further bloodshed. Negotiations with the occupiers were aided by the two sides' mutual goal of destroying the Partisans.

In 1942, Partisans forces were on the rise, having established large liberated territories within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Chetnik forces, partially because of their collaboration with the Italian occupation, were also gaining in strength, however, but were no match to the Partisans and required Axis logistical support to attack the liberated territories. In light of the changing strategic situation, Hitler and the German high command decided to disarm the Chetniks and destroy the Partisans for good. In spite of Hitler's insistence, Italian forces in the end refused to disarm the Chetniks (thus rendering that course of action impossible), under the justification that the Italian occupation forces could not afford to lose the Chetniks as allies in their maintenance of the occupation.\n\n====Collaboration with the Germans====\n[[File:Chetniks pose with German soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A group of Chetniks of [[Kosta Pe\u0107anac]] pose with German soldiers in an unidentified village in Serbia]]\nWhen Germans invaded Yugoslavia they met in the Chetniks an organization trained and adapted for guerilla warfare.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=20}} Although there were some clashes between the Germans and the Chetniks as early as May 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 thought of resistance in terms of setting up an organisation which, when the time was ripe, would rise against the occupying forces.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=26}} British policy with regard to European resistance movements was to restrain them from activities which would lead to their premature destruction, and this policy coincided initially with the concepts on the basis of which Mihailovi\u0107's movement was being operated.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=27}} In order to dissociate himself from the Chetniks who collaborated with the Germans, Mihailovi\u0107 at first called its movement the \"Ravna Gora Movement\".{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=21}}\n\nAs early as spring 1942, the Germans favored the collaboration agreement the Usta\u0161e and the Chetniks had established in a large part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the Usta\u0161e military was supplied by, and immediately subordinate to, the German military occupation, collaboration between the two constituted indirect German-Chetnik collaboration. This was all favorable to the Germans primarily because the agreement was directed against the Partisans, contributed to the pacification of areas significant for German war supplies, and reduced the need for additional German occupation troops (as Chetniks were assisting the occupation). After the Italian capitulation on 8 September 1943, the German [[114th J\u00e4ger Division]] even incorporated a Chetnik detachment in its advance to retake the Adriatic coast from the Partisans who had temporarily liberated it.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=308}} The report on German-Chetnik collaboration of the XV Army Corps on 19 November 1943 to the [[2nd Panzer Army]] states that the Chetniks were \"leaning on the German forces\" for close to a year.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}\n\n[[File:\u010cetnici i Nemci u okupiranoj Jugoslaviji.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A group of Chetniks pose with German officers]]\nGerman-Chetnik collaboration entered a new phase after the Italian surrender, because the Germans now had to police a much larger area than before and fight the Partisans in the whole of Yugoslavia. Consequently, they significantly liberalized their policy towards the Chetniks and mobilized all Serb nationalist forces against the Partisans. The 2nd Panzer Army oversaw these developments: the XV Army Corps was now officially allowed to utilize Chetniks troops and forge a \"local alliance\". The first formal and direct agreement between the German occupation forces and the Chetniks took place in early October 1943 between the German-led [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division]] and a detachment of Chetniks under Mane Rokvi\u0107 operating in western Bosnia and Lika.

The document called on all Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs to join the Partisans. Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks refused to follow the order and abide by the agreement and continued to engage the Partisans (by now the official Yugoslav Allied force). Consequently, on 29 August 1944, King Peter II dismissed Mihailovi\u0107 as Chief-of-Staff of the Yugoslav Army and on 12 September appointed Marshal Tito in his place.

A report prepared in April 1944 by the U.S. [[Office of Strategic Services]] commented that:{{Quote|[Mihailovi\u0107] should be viewed in the same light as Nedi\u0107, Ljoti\u0107, and the Bulgarian occupation forces.|<small>Office of Strategic Services report, April 1944</small>{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=133\u201335}}}}\n\nIn mid-August 1944, Mihailovi\u0107, Nedi\u0107, and [[Dragomir Jovanovi\u0107]] met in the village of [[Ra\u017eani]] secretly where Nedi\u0107 agreed to give one hundred million dinars for wages and to request from the Germans arms and ammunition for Mihailovi\u0107. On 6 September 1944, under the authority of the Germans and formalization by Nedi\u0107, Mihailovi\u0107 took command over the entire military force of the Nedi\u0107 administration, including the [[Serbian State Guard]], [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], and the Serbian Border Guard.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=57}}\n\n====Contacts with Hungary====\nIn mid-1943, the Hungarian General Staff arranged a meeting between a Serbian officer in the Nedi\u0107 regime and Mihailovi\u0107. The officer was instructed to express to Mihailovi\u0107 Hungary's regret for the massacre at [[Novi Sad]] and to promise that those responsible would be punished. Hungary recognised Mihailovi\u0107 as the representative of the Yugoslav government-in-exile and asked him, in the event of an Allied landing in the Balkans, not to enter Hungary with his troops, but to leave the border question to the peace conference. After contact was established, food, medicine, munitions and horses were sent to Mihailovi\u0107. During his visit to [[Rome]] in April 1943, Prime Minister [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]] talked about Italo-Hungarian cooperation with the Chetniks, but Mussolini said he favoured Tito.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|pp=145-47}}\n\nHungary also tried to contact Mihailovi\u0107 through the royal Yugoslav government's representative in Istanbul in order to cooperate against the Partisans. The Yugoslav Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Mom\u010dilo Nin\u010di\u0107]], reportedly sent a message to Istanbul asking the Hungarians to send an envoy and a Serb politician from the [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|Hungarian-occupied territories]] to negotiate. Nothing came of these contacts, but Mihailovi\u0107 sent a representative, \u010cedomir Bo\u0161njakovi\u0107, to [[Budapest]]. For their part the Hungarians sent arms, medicine and released Serbian POWs willing to serve with the Chetniks down the Danube.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=180}}\n\nAfter the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation of Hungary]] in March 1944, the Chetnik relationship was one of the few foreign contacts independent of German influence that Hungary had. A Hungarian diplomat, L. Hory, formerly posted in Belgrade, twice visited Mihailovi\u0107 in Bosnia, and the Hungarians continued to send him munitions, even across Croatian territory.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=265}} The last contact between Mihailovi\u0107 and Hungary occurred on 13 October 1944, shortly before the [[Operation Panzerfaust|German-sponsored coup]] of 15 October.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=355}}\n\n===Terror tactics and cleansing actions===\n {{see also|Chetnik war crimes in World War II}}\nChetnik ideology revolved around the notion of a [[Greater Serbia]] within the borders of Yugoslavia, to be created out of all territories in which Serbs were found, even if the numbers were small. This goal had long been the foundation of the movement for a Greater Serbia. During Axis occupation the notion of clearing or \"[[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansing]]\" these territories was introduced largely in response to the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|massacres of Serbs by the Ustashe]] in the Independent State of Croatia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=173}} However, the largest Chetnik massacres took place in eastern Bosnia where they preceded any significant Ustashe operations.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=143}} According to Pavlowitch, terror tactics were committed by local commanders of the Chetnik organisation. Mihailovi\u0107 disapproved these acts of ethnic cleansing against civilians, however he failed to take action in stopping these acts of terror, given the lack of command he had over local commanders and the rudimentary methods of communication that existed in the Chetnik command structure.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=127-128}}\n\nPrior to the outbreak of World War II, use of terror tactics had a long tradition in the area as various oppressed groups sought their freedom and atrocities were committed by all parties engaged in conflict in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256\u201357}} During the early stages of the occupation, the Usta\u0161e had also recruited a number of Muslims to aid in the persecutions of the Serbs, and even though only a relatively small number of Croats and Muslims engaged in these activities, and many opposed them, those actions initiated a cycle of violence and retribution between the Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims, as each sought to rid the others from the territories they controlled.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=47\u201349}}\n\nIn particular, Usta\u0161e ideologues were concerned with the large Serb minority in the NDH, and initiated acts of terror on a wide scale in May 1941. Two months later, in July, the Germans protested the brutality of these actions. Reprisals followed, as in the case of [[Nevesinje]], where Serb peasants staged an uprising in response to the persecution, drove out the [[Usta\u0161e militia]], but then engaged in reprisals, killing hundreds of Muslims and some Croats, whom they associated with the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=175}}\n [[File:Drazas Instrukcije.JPG|thumb|The \"Instructions\" (''\"Instrukcije\"'') of 1941, ordering [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], and others.]]\nA directive dated 20 December 1941, addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro, Major \u0110or\u0111ije La\u0161i\u0107 and Captain Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, outlined, among other things, the cleansing of non-Serb populations in order to create a Greater Serbia:{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}\n\n{{quote|text=\n#The struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II;\n#the creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a [[Great Serbia]] which is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia, [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Srijem]], the [[Banat]], and [[Ba\u010dka]];\n#the struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated Slovene territories under the Italians and Germans ([[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]], [[Istria]], and [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]) as well as [[Bulgaria]], and northern [[Albania]] with [[Skadar]];\n#the cleansing of the state territory of all national minorities and a-national elements;\n#the creation of contiguous frontiers between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and [[Slovenia]] by cleansing the Muslim population from [[Sand\u017eak]] and the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina.|sign=Directive of 20 December 1941{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}}}\n\nThe authenticity of the directive is disputed.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=120}} Some have attributed the directive as having come from Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=171, 210, 256}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=64}}{{sfn|Cigar|1995|p=18}} Others have claimed that there is no original and that it may have been a forgery made by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 to suit his purposes.{{sfn|Karchmar|1987|p=397}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=80}} Mihailovi\u0107's headquarters sent further instructions to the commander of the Second Sarajevo Chetnik Brigade clarifying the goal: \"It should be made clear to everyone that, after the war or when the time becomes appropriate, we will complete our task and that no one except the Serbs will be left in Serbian lands.

In late autumn of 1941 the Italians handed over the towns of Vi\u0161egrad, Gora\u017ede, Fo\u010da and the surrounding areas, in south-east Bosnia to the Chetniks to run as a puppet administration and NDH forces were compelled by the Italians to withdraw from there.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=143-45}} After the Chetniks gained control of [[Gora\u017ede]] on 29 November 1941, they began a massacre of Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials that became a systematic massacre of the local Muslim civilian population, with several hundred murdered and their bodies left hanging in the town or thrown into the Drina river. On 5 December 1941, the Chetniks received the town of [[Fo\u010da]] from the Italians and proceeded to massacre around five hundred Muslims.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}} Additional massacres against the Muslims in the area of Fo\u010da took place in August 1942.

Over time British support moved away from the Chetniks, who refused to stop collaborating with the Italians and Germans instead of fighting them, towards the Partisans, who were eager to increase their anti-Axis activity.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAfter the [[Tehran Conference]], the Partisans received official recognition as the legitimate national liberation force by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who subsequently set up the [[Balkan Air Force]] (under the influence and suggestion of Brigadier [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]]) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=228}} In February 1944, Mihailovic's Chetniks failed to fulfill British demands to demolish key bridges over the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] and [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]] rivers, causing the British to withdraw their liaisons and halt supplying the Chetniks.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=158}} Although British support for the Chetniks ceased, the Americans were less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Chetniks.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|pp=245-257}} As support shifted towards the Partisans, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks attempted to recommence Allied support for the Chetniks by displaying their eagerness to help the Allies.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=48}} This eagerness to help was put into practice when the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) approached Mihailovic's Chetniks in mid 1944 to organise the airlift of downed US airmen.

The document called on all Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs to join the Partisans. Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks refused to accept the Royal Government's agreement and continued to engage the Partisans, by now the official Yugoslav Allied force. Consequently, on 29 August 1944, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] dismissed Mihailovi\u0107 as Chief-of-Staff of the Yugoslav Army and on 12 September appointed Marshal Josip Broz Tito in his place. On 6 October 1944, the Nedi\u0107 government transferred the [[Serbian State Guard]] to Mihailovi\u0107's command, although cooperation proved impossible and they separated in January 1945 while in Bosnia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=228}}\n\n===Cooperation with the Soviets===\nIn September 1944, the Soviets invaded and occupied Romania and Bulgaria, removing them from the war and putting Soviet forces on the borders of Yugoslavia. The Chetniks were not unprepared for this, and throughout the war their propaganda strove to harness the pro-Russian and pan-Slavic sympathies of the majority of the Serb population. The distinction between the Russian people and their communist government was belaboured, as was the supposed difference between Yugoslav Partisans, who were allegedly [[Trotskyists]], and the Soviets, who were [[Stalinists]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=391}}\n\nOn 10 September 1944, a Chetnik mission of approximately 150 men, led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Velimir Pileti\u0107]], commander of northeastern Serbia, crossed the Danube into Romania and established contact with Soviet forces at [[Craiova]].{{sfn|Timofejev|2010|p=87}} Their main purpose, according to the memoirs of one of them, Lt. Col. Miodrag Ratkovi\u0107, was to establish Soviet agreement to certain political goals: a cessation of the civil war through Soviet mediation, free elections supervised by the Allied powers and the postponement of any war-related trials until after elections. Before the mission could go on to [[Bucharest]], where the American and British military missions were, they were denounced by one of Pileti\u0107's aides as British spies and arrested by the Soviets on 1 October.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=392}}\n\nAlthough the Chetniks believed they could fight as allies of the Soviets at the same time as they fought the Partisans, they did manage some local cooperation with the former while antagonising the Germans. In a circular of 5 October, Mihailovi\u0107 wrote: \"We consider the Russians as our allies. The struggle against Tito's forces in Serbia will be continued.\" The Germans were aware of the Chetniks' disposition through radio intercepts, and their intelligence reported on 19 October that \"the Chetniks have never been prepared by Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 through appropriate propaganda for a fighting encounter with the Russians. Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 has on the contrary upheld the fiction that the Russians as allies of the Americans and the British will never act against the interests of the Serbian nationalists.\"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=392}}\n\nThe commander of a group of the Shock Corps, Lt. Col. Keserovi\u0107, was the first Chetnik officer to cooperate with the Soviets. In mid-October his troops met Soviet forces advancing into central eastern Serbia from Bulgaria and together they captured the town of [[Kru\u0161evac]], the Soviets leaving Keserovi\u0107 in charge of the town. Within three days, Keserovi\u0107 was warning his fellow commanders that the Russians were only talking with the Partisans and disarming the Chetniks. Keserovi\u0107 reported to Supreme Command on 19 October that his delegate to the Soviet division had returned with a message ordering his men to be disarmed and incorporated in the Partisan armed forces by 18 October.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=393}}\n\nAnother Chetnik commander to cooperate with the Soviets was Captain Predrag Rakovi\u0107 of the Second Ravna Gora Corps, whose men participated in the capture of [[\u010ca\u010dak]], where they captured 339 soldiers of the ''[[Russian Corps|Russisches Schutzkorps Serbien]]'' (whom they turned over to the Soviets). Rakovi\u0107 apparently had a written agreement with the local Soviet commander, placing himself and his men under Soviet command in return for recognition that they were Mihailovi\u0107's men. After a protest from Tito to Marshal [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]], commander of the front, Keserovi\u0107's and Rakovi\u0107's cooperation came to an end. By 11 November the latter had gone into hiding and his forces had fled west to avoid being disarmed and placed under Partisan control.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=394}} After the fall of Belgrade to Soviet and Partisan troops there was little hope of the Chetniks surviving as a legitimate fighting force in Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Retreat and dissolution===\nFinally, in April and May 1945, as the victorious Partisans took possession of the country's territory, many Chetniks retreated toward Italy and a smaller group toward Austria. Many were captured by the Partisans or returned to Yugoslavia by British forces while a number were [[Bleiburg repatriations|killed following repatriation from Bleiburg]]. Some were tried for treason and were sentenced to prison terms or death. Many were summarily executed, especially in the first months after the end of the war.

In October 1941, German soldiers conducted two mass murder campaigns against Serbian civilians in [[Kraljevo massacre|Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac massacre|Kragujevac]], with a combined death toll reaching over 4,500 civilians, convincing Chetnik leader [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] that killing German troops would only result in further unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of [[Serbs]].

They used terror tactics against [[Croats]] in areas where Serbs and Croats were intermixed, against the [[Bosniaks|Muslim]] population in [[Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]] and [[Sand\u017eak]], and against the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist]]-led [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and their supporters in all areas. These tactics included the killing of civilians, burning of villages, assassinations and destruction of property and exacerbating existing ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs.<ref>Djokic, Dejan. \"Coming To Terms With The Past: Former Yugoslavia.\" History Today 54.6 (2004): 17-19.

This document continued additional formulations of strategy, including collaboration with Italian forces as a ''modus vivendi'', formation of Croatian Chetnik units as part of a continuing struggle against the Partisans, Domobrans and Usta\u0161e.

However, Tito's Partisans managed to break through the encirclement, cross the river, and engage the Chetniks. The conflict resulted in a near-total Partisan victory, after which the Chetniks were almost entirely incapacitated in the area west of the [[Drina]] river. The Partisans continued on, and later again escaped the Germans in the [[Battle of Sutjeska]]. In the meantime, the Allies stopped planning an invasion of the Balkans and finally rescinded their support for the Chetniks and instead supplied the Partisans. At the [[Teheran Conference]] of 1943 and the [[Yalta Conference]] of 1945, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] decided to split their influence in Yugoslavia in half.\n\n===Composition===\n[[File:Aleksandar Simi\u0107, fotografije Ravnogorskog pokreta (21).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chetnik with [[light machine gun]] [[ZB vz. 26|M37]].]]\nThe Chetniks were almost exclusively made up of Serbs{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=173\u201374}} and consisted of \"local defence units, marauding bands of Serb villagers, anti-partisan auxiliaries, forcibly mobilised peasants, and armed refugees\".{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=186}} The vast majority of Orthodox priests supported the Chetniks with some, notably [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] and [[Savo Bo\u017ei\u0107]], becoming commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=177}} A few Croats in central [[Dalmatia]] and Primorje supported Mihailovi\u0107, but the group was too small to have any political or military significance.

In 1942, Partisans forces were on the rise, having established large liberated territories within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Chetnik forces, partially because of their collaboration with the Italian occupation, were also gaining in strength, however, but were no match to the Partisans and required Axis logistical support to attack the liberated territories. In light of the changing strategic situation, Hitler and the German high command decided to disarm the Chetniks and destroy the Partisans for good. In spite of Hitler's insistence, Italian forces in the end refused to disarm the Chetniks (thus rendering that course of action impossible), under the justification that the Italian occupation forces could not afford to lose the Chetniks as allies in their maintenance of the occupation.\n\n====Collaboration with the Germans====\n[[File:Chetniks pose with German soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A group of Chetniks of [[Kosta Pe\u0107anac]] pose with German soldiers in an unidentified village in Serbia]]\nWhen Germans invaded Yugoslavia they met in the Chetniks an organization trained and adapted for guerilla warfare.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=20}} Although there were some clashes between the Germans and the Chetniks as early as May 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 thought of resistance in terms of setting up an organisation which, when the time was ripe, would rise against the occupying forces.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=26}} British policy with regard to European resistance movements was to restrain them from activities which would lead to their premature destruction, and this policy coincided initially with the concepts on the basis of which Mihailovi\u0107's movement was being operated.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=27}} In order to dissociate himself from the Chetniks who collaborated with the Germans, Mihailovi\u0107 at first called its movement the \"Ravna Gora Movement\".{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=21}}\n\nAs early as spring 1942, the Germans favored the collaboration agreement the Usta\u0161e and the Chetniks had established in a large part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the Usta\u0161e military was supplied by, and immediately subordinate to, the German military occupation, collaboration between the two constituted indirect German-Chetnik collaboration. This was all favorable to the Germans primarily because the agreement was directed against the Partisans, contributed to the pacification of areas significant for German war supplies, and reduced the need for additional German occupation troops (as Chetniks were assisting the occupation). After the Italian capitulation on 8 September 1943, the German [[114th J\u00e4ger Division]] even incorporated a Chetnik detachment in its advance to retake the Adriatic coast from the Partisans who had temporarily liberated it.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=308}} The report on German-Chetnik collaboration of the XV Army Corps on 19 November 1943 to the [[2nd Panzer Army]] states that the Chetniks were \"leaning on the German forces\" for close to a year.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}\n\n[[File:\u010cetnici i Nemci u okupiranoj Jugoslaviji.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A group of Chetniks pose with German officers]]\nGerman-Chetnik collaboration entered a new phase after the Italian surrender, because the Germans now had to police a much larger area than before and fight the Partisans in the whole of Yugoslavia. Consequently, they significantly liberalized their policy towards the Chetniks and mobilized all Serb nationalist forces against the Partisans. The 2nd Panzer Army oversaw these developments: the XV Army Corps was now officially allowed to utilize Chetniks troops and forge a \"local alliance\". The first formal and direct agreement between the German occupation forces and the Chetniks took place in early October 1943 between the German-led [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division]] and a detachment of Chetniks under Mane Rokvi\u0107 operating in western Bosnia and Lika.

From this point on, the German occupation actually started to \"openly favor\" Chetnik ([[Serbs|Serb]]) troops over the [[Croats|Croat]] formations of the NDH, due to the pro-Partisan dispositions of the Croatian rank-and-file.

In addition, the Chief of Staff of the 2nd Panzer Army observed in a letter to the Usta\u0161e liaison officer that the Chetniks fighting the Partisans in Eastern Bosnia were \"making a worthwhile contribution to the Croatian state\", and that the 2nd Army \"refused in principle\" to accept Croatian complaints against the usage of these units. German-Chetnik collaboration continued to take place until the very end of the war, with the tacit approval of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetnik Supreme Command in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia.

On 14 August 1944, the Tito-\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement between the Partisans and the Yugoslav King and government-in-exile was signed on the island of Vis. The document called on all Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs to join the Partisans. Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks refused to follow the order and abide by the agreement and continued to engage the Partisans (by now the official Yugoslav Allied force). Consequently, on 29 August 1944, King Peter II dismissed Mihailovi\u0107 as Chief-of-Staff of the Yugoslav Army and on 12 September appointed Marshal Tito in his place. Tito at this point became the Prime Minister of the Yugoslav state and the joint government.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Collaboration with the Government of National Salvation====\nIn the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, the Germans initially installed [[Milan A\u0107imovi\u0107]], as leader, but later replaced him with General [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], former minister of war, who governed until 1944. A\u0107imovi\u0107 instead later served as the key liaison between the Germans and the Chetniks.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=133\u2013135}} In the second half of August 1941, prior to Nedi\u0107 assuming power, the Germans arranged with Kosta Pe\u0107anac for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to serve as auxiliaries for the gendarmerie.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=183}} Collaboration between the Government of National Salvation and Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks began in fall of 1941 and lasted until the end of German occupation.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=214\u201316}}\n\nNedi\u0107 was initially firmly opposed to Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks. On 4 September 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 sent Major Aleksandar Mi\u0161i\u0107 and Miodrag Pavlovi\u0107 to enter a meeting with Nedi\u0107 and nothing was accomplished. After Mihailovi\u0107 shifted his policy of mild cooperation with the Partisans to becoming hostile to them and ceasing anti-German activity in late October 1941, Nedi\u0107 relaxed his opposition. On 15 October, Colonel [[Milorad Popovi\u0107 (Yugoslav colonel)|Milorad Popovi\u0107]], acting on behalf of Nedi\u0107, gave Mihailovi\u0107 about 500,000 dinars (in addition to an equal amount given on 4 October) to persuade the Chetniks to collaborate. On 26 October 1941, Popovi\u0107 gave an additional 2,500,000 dinars.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=133\u201335}}\n\nBy mid-November 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 put 2,000 of his men under Nedi\u0107's direct command and shortly later these men joined the Germans in an anti-Partisan operation.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=133\u201335}} When the Germans launched [[Operation Mihailovi\u0107]] on 6\u20137 December 1941, with the intent of capturing Mihailovi\u0107 and removing his headquarters in Ravna Gora, he escaped, probably because he was warned of the attack by A\u0107imovi\u0107 on 5 December.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn June 1942, Mihailovi\u0107 left the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia for Montenegro and was out of contact with the Nedi\u0107 authorities until he returned. In September 1942, Mihailovi\u0107 orchestrated civil disobedience against the Nedi\u0107 government via the use of leaflets and clandestine radio transmitter messages.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=67}} This civil obedience may have been orchestrated in order to use as a cover to conduct sabotage operations on railway lines used to supply Axis forces in [[North Africa]], however it has been disputed.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=98-100}} In the fall of 1942 the Chetniks of Mihailovi\u0107 (and Pe\u0107anac) who had been legalized by the Nedi\u0107 administration were dissolved. By 1943, Nedi\u0107 feared that the Chetniks would become the primary collaborator with the Germans and after the Chetniks murdered Ceka \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, deputy minister of internal affairs, in March 1944 he opted to replace him with a prominent Chetnik in the hopes of quelling the rivalry. A report prepared in April 1944 by the U.S. [[Office of Strategic Services]] commented that:{{Quote|[Mihailovi\u0107] should be viewed in the same light as Nedi\u0107, Ljoti\u0107, and the Bulgarian occupation forces.|<small>Office of Strategic Services report, April 1944</small>{{sfn|Ramet|2006|pp=133\u201335}}}}\n\nIn mid-August 1944, Mihailovi\u0107, Nedi\u0107, and [[Dragomir Jovanovi\u0107]] met in the village of [[Ra\u017eani]] secretly where Nedi\u0107 agreed to give one hundred million dinars for wages and to request from the Germans arms and ammunition for Mihailovi\u0107. On 6 September 1944, under the authority of the Germans and formalization by Nedi\u0107, Mihailovi\u0107 took command over the entire military force of the Nedi\u0107 administration, including the [[Serbian State Guard]], [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], and the Serbian Border Guard.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=57}}\n\n====Contacts with Hungary====\nIn mid-1943, the Hungarian General Staff arranged a meeting between a Serbian officer in the Nedi\u0107 regime and Mihailovi\u0107. The officer was instructed to express to Mihailovi\u0107 Hungary's regret for the massacre at [[Novi Sad]] and to promise that those responsible would be punished. Hungary recognised Mihailovi\u0107 as the representative of the Yugoslav government-in-exile and asked him, in the event of an Allied landing in the Balkans, not to enter Hungary with his troops, but to leave the border question to the peace conference. After contact was established, food, medicine, munitions and horses were sent to Mihailovi\u0107. During his visit to [[Rome]] in April 1943, Prime Minister [[Mikl\u00f3s K\u00e1llay]] talked about Italo-Hungarian cooperation with the Chetniks, but Mussolini said he favoured Tito.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|pp=145-47}}\n\nHungary also tried to contact Mihailovi\u0107 through the royal Yugoslav government's representative in Istanbul in order to cooperate against the Partisans. The Yugoslav Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Mom\u010dilo Nin\u010di\u0107]], reportedly sent a message to Istanbul asking the Hungarians to send an envoy and a Serb politician from the [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|Hungarian-occupied territories]] to negotiate. Nothing came of these contacts, but Mihailovi\u0107 sent a representative, \u010cedomir Bo\u0161njakovi\u0107, to [[Budapest]]. For their part the Hungarians sent arms, medicine and released Serbian POWs willing to serve with the Chetniks down the Danube.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=180}}\n\nAfter the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation of Hungary]] in March 1944, the Chetnik relationship was one of the few foreign contacts independent of German influence that Hungary had. A Hungarian diplomat, L. Hory, formerly posted in Belgrade, twice visited Mihailovi\u0107 in Bosnia, and the Hungarians continued to send him munitions, even across Croatian territory.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=265}} The last contact between Mihailovi\u0107 and Hungary occurred on 13 October 1944, shortly before the [[Operation Panzerfaust|German-sponsored coup]] of 15 October.{{sfn|Macartney|1957|p=355}}\n\n===Terror tactics and cleansing actions===\n {{see also|Chetnik war crimes in World War II}}\nChetnik ideology revolved around the notion of a [[Greater Serbia]] within the borders of Yugoslavia, to be created out of all territories in which Serbs were found, even if the numbers were small. This goal had long been the foundation of the movement for a Greater Serbia. During Axis occupation the notion of clearing or \"[[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansing]]\" these territories was introduced largely in response to the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|massacres of Serbs by the Ustashe]] in the Independent State of Croatia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=173}} However, the largest Chetnik massacres took place in eastern Bosnia where they preceded any significant Ustashe operations.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=143}} According to Pavlowitch, terror tactics were committed by local commanders of the Chetnik organisation. Mihailovi\u0107 disapproved these acts of ethnic cleansing against civilians, however he failed to take action in stopping these acts of terror, given the lack of command he had over local commanders and the rudimentary methods of communication that existed in the Chetnik command structure.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=127-128}}\n\nPrior to the outbreak of World War II, use of terror tactics had a long tradition in the area as various oppressed groups sought their freedom and atrocities were committed by all parties engaged in conflict in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256\u201357}} During the early stages of the occupation, the Usta\u0161e had also recruited a number of Muslims to aid in the persecutions of the Serbs, and even though only a relatively small number of Croats and Muslims engaged in these activities, and many opposed them, those actions initiated a cycle of violence and retribution between the Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims, as each sought to rid the others from the territories they controlled.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=47\u201349}}\n\nIn particular, Usta\u0161e ideologues were concerned with the large Serb minority in the NDH, and initiated acts of terror on a wide scale in May 1941. Two months later, in July, the Germans protested the brutality of these actions. Reprisals followed, as in the case of [[Nevesinje]], where Serb peasants staged an uprising in response to the persecution, drove out the [[Usta\u0161e militia]], but then engaged in reprisals, killing hundreds of Muslims and some Croats, whom they associated with the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994|p=175}}\n [[File:Drazas Instrukcije.JPG|thumb|The \"Instructions\" (''\"Instrukcije\"'') of 1941, ordering [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], and others.]]\nA directive dated 20 December 1941, addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro, Major \u0110or\u0111ije La\u0161i\u0107 and Captain Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, outlined, among other things, the cleansing of non-Serb populations in order to create a Greater Serbia:{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}\n\n{{quote|text=\n#The struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II;\n#the creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a [[Great Serbia]] which is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia, [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Srijem]], the [[Banat]], and [[Ba\u010dka]];\n#the struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated Slovene territories under the Italians and Germans ([[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]], [[Istria]], and [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]) as well as [[Bulgaria]], and northern [[Albania]] with [[Skadar]];\n#the cleansing of the state territory of all national minorities and a-national elements;\n#the creation of contiguous frontiers between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and [[Slovenia]] by cleansing the Muslim population from [[Sand\u017eak]] and the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina.|sign=Directive of 20 December 1941{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}}}\n\nThe authenticity of the directive is disputed.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=120}} Some have attributed the directive as having come from Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=171, 210, 256}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=64}}{{sfn|Cigar|1995|p=18}} Others have claimed that there is no original and that it may have been a forgery made by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 to suit his purposes.{{sfn|Karchmar|1987|p=397}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=80}} Mihailovi\u0107's headquarters sent further instructions to the commander of the Second Sarajevo Chetnik Brigade clarifying the goal: \"It should be made clear to everyone that, after the war or when the time becomes appropriate, we will complete our task and that no one except the Serbs will be left in Serbian lands.

Over time British support moved away from the Chetniks, who refused to stop collaborating with the Italians and Germans instead of fighting them, towards the Partisans, who were eager to increase their anti-Axis activity.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|pp=101\u201302}}\n\nAfter the [[Tehran Conference]], the Partisans received official recognition as the legitimate national liberation force by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who subsequently set up the [[Balkan Air Force]] (under the influence and suggestion of Brigadier [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]]) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=228}} In February 1944, Mihailovic's Chetniks failed to fulfill British demands to demolish key bridges over the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] and [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]] rivers, causing the British to withdraw their liaisons and halt supplying the Chetniks.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=158}} Although British support for the Chetniks ceased, the Americans were less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Chetniks.{{sfn|Roberts|1987|pp=245-257}} As support shifted towards the Partisans, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks attempted to recommence Allied support for the Chetniks by displaying their eagerness to help the Allies.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=48}} This eagerness to help was put into practice when the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) approached Mihailovic's Chetniks in mid 1944 to organise the airlift of downed US airmen. This operation known as the [[Halyard Mission]] resulted in the rescue of 417 US airmen that were previously kept safe by Mihailovic's Chetniks. Mihailovi\u0107 later received the [[Legion of Merit]] from US President [[Harry S. Truman]] for the rescue of Allied pilots.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=470}}\n\n[[File:Pranjani Ceremony September 6 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Joint US/Chetnik military ceremony in Pranjani September 6, 1944: Capt.

Robert McDowell (OSS)]]\nOn 14 August 1944, the [[Tito-\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement]] between Partisans and the Government in exile was signed on the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. The document called on all Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs to join the Partisans. Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks refused to accept the Royal Government's agreement and continued to engage the Partisans, by now the official Yugoslav Allied force. Consequently, on 29 August 1944, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] dismissed Mihailovi\u0107 as Chief-of-Staff of the Yugoslav Army and on 12 September appointed Marshal Josip Broz Tito in his place. On 6 October 1944, the Nedi\u0107 government transferred the [[Serbian State Guard]] to Mihailovi\u0107's command, although cooperation proved impossible and they separated in January 1945 while in Bosnia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=228}}\n\n===Cooperation with the Soviets===\nIn September 1944, the Soviets invaded and occupied Romania and Bulgaria, removing them from the war and putting Soviet forces on the borders of Yugoslavia. The Chetniks were not unprepared for this, and throughout the war their propaganda strove to harness the pro-Russian and pan-Slavic sympathies of the majority of the Serb population. The distinction between the Russian people and their communist government was belaboured, as was the supposed difference between Yugoslav Partisans, who were allegedly [[Trotskyists]], and the Soviets, who were [[Stalinists]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=391}}\n\nOn 10 September 1944, a Chetnik mission of approximately 150 men, led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Velimir Pileti\u0107]], commander of northeastern Serbia, crossed the Danube into Romania and established contact with Soviet forces at [[Craiova]].{{sfn|Timofejev|2010|p=87}} Their main purpose, according to the memoirs of one of them, Lt. Col. Miodrag Ratkovi\u0107, was to establish Soviet agreement to certain political goals: a cessation of the civil war through Soviet mediation, free elections supervised by the Allied powers and the postponement of any war-related trials until after elections. Before the mission could go on to [[Bucharest]], where the American and British military missions were, they were denounced by one of Pileti\u0107's aides as British spies and arrested by the Soviets on 1 October.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=392}}\n\nAlthough the Chetniks believed they could fight as allies of the Soviets at the same time as they fought the Partisans, they did manage some local cooperation with the former while antagonising the Germans. In a circular of 5 October, Mihailovi\u0107 wrote: \"We consider the Russians as our allies. The struggle against Tito's forces in Serbia will be continued.\" The Germans were aware of the Chetniks' disposition through radio intercepts, and their intelligence reported on 19 October that \"the Chetniks have never been prepared by Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 through appropriate propaganda for a fighting encounter with the Russians. Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 has on the contrary upheld the fiction that the Russians as allies of the Americans and the British will never act against the interests of the Serbian nationalists.\"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=392}}\n\nThe commander of a group of the Shock Corps, Lt. Col. Keserovi\u0107, was the first Chetnik officer to cooperate with the Soviets. In mid-October his troops met Soviet forces advancing into central eastern Serbia from Bulgaria and together they captured the town of [[Kru\u0161evac]], the Soviets leaving Keserovi\u0107 in charge of the town. Within three days, Keserovi\u0107 was warning his fellow commanders that the Russians were only talking with the Partisans and disarming the Chetniks. Keserovi\u0107 reported to Supreme Command on 19 October that his delegate to the Soviet division had returned with a message ordering his men to be disarmed and incorporated in the Partisan armed forces by 18 October.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=393}}\n\nAnother Chetnik commander to cooperate with the Soviets was Captain Predrag Rakovi\u0107 of the Second Ravna Gora Corps, whose men participated in the capture of [[\u010ca\u010dak]], where they captured 339 soldiers of the ''[[Russian Corps|Russisches Schutzkorps Serbien]]'' (whom they turned over to the Soviets). Rakovi\u0107 apparently had a written agreement with the local Soviet commander, placing himself and his men under Soviet command in return for recognition that they were Mihailovi\u0107's men. After a protest from Tito to Marshal [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]], commander of the front, Keserovi\u0107's and Rakovi\u0107's cooperation came to an end. By 11 November the latter had gone into hiding and his forces had fled west to avoid being disarmed and placed under Partisan control.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=394}} After the fall of Belgrade to Soviet and Partisan troops there was little hope of the Chetniks surviving as a legitimate fighting force in Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Retreat and dissolution===\nFinally, in April and May 1945, as the victorious Partisans took possession of the country's territory, many Chetniks retreated toward Italy and a smaller group toward Austria. Many were captured by the Partisans or returned to Yugoslavia by British forces while a number were [[Bleiburg repatriations|killed following repatriation from Bleiburg]]. Some were tried for treason and were sentenced to prison terms or death. Many were summarily executed, especially in the first months after the end of the war. Mihailovi\u0107 and his few remaining followers tried to fight their way back to the Ravna Gora, but he was captured by Partisan forces. In March 1946, Mihailovi\u0107 was brought to Belgrade, where he was tried and executed on charges of treason in July. During the closing years of World War II, many Chetniks defected from their units, as the Partisan commander-in-chief, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, proclaimed a general amnesty to all defecting forces for a time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796967,00.html|work=Time|title=Foreign News: New Power|date=4 December 1944|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===SFR Yugoslavia===\n{{see also|Trial of Mihailovi\u0107 et al.}}\n\n [[File:Dra\u017ea pred sudom.jpg|thumb|[[Trial of Mihailovi\u0107 et al.|Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 under trial,]] 1946.]]\nAfter the end of World War II, the Chetniks were banned in the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Of the charged, 15 were sentenced to long prison sentences and one was sentenced to death. On 12 January 1952, the government reported four or five Chetnik \"brigades\" numbering around 400 men each still existed and were at the borders of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, and in Montenegrin forests, attacking meetings of the communist party and police buildings. As late as November 1952, small Chetnik groups operated in mountains and forests around [[Kalinovik]] and [[Trnovo, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Trnovo]].

France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it could [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|capture Gibraltar]] from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that would be set up an independent [[Indian barrier state]] under Spanish control.<ref>Smith, Dwight L. \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Americans realized that they could get a better deal directly from London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in charge of the British negotiations (some of which took place in his study at Lansdowne House, now a bar in the Lansdowne Club) and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref name=ritcheson>{{cite journal |last=Ritcheson |first=Charles R. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40105313?seq=1 |title=The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality |journal=[[The International History Review]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |date=August 1983 |pages=322\u2013345 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

Historians such as  Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States.  The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants,  without any military or administrative costs to Britain.<ref name=ritcheson/>  The point was the United States would become a major trading partner. As the French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] later put it, \"The English buy peace rather than make it\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Vermont was included within the boundaries because the state of New York insisted that Vermont was a part of New York, although Vermont was then under a [[Vermont Republic|government that considered Vermont not to be a part of the United States]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel Flagg |authorlink=Samuel Flagg Bemis |last=Bemis |title=The Diplomacy of the American Revolution |year=1957 |publisher=Indiana University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/diplomacyofameri00bemi|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nPrivileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status (including protection from [[Barbary corsairs#United States and the Barbary Wars|pirates]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; see: the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]) were withdrawn. Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also ignored Article 6  (e.g., by confiscating Loyalist property for \"unpaid debts\"). Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors. The British often ignored the provision of Article 7  about removal of slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=James W. |last=Ely Jr. |title=The Guardian of Every Other Right: A Constitutional History of Property Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBXuRfB4DH4C&pg=PA35 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=35 |isbn=978-0199724529}}</ref>\n\nThe actual [[geography of North America]] turned out not to match the details used in the treaty. The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain.

But in fact the Mississippi does not extend that far northward; the line going west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the river.\n\nGreat Britain violated the treaty stipulation that they should relinquish control of forts in United States territory \"with all convenient speed.\" British troops remained stationed at six forts in the [[Great Lakes region]], plus two at the north end of [[Lake Champlain]]. The British also built an additional fort in present-day Ohio in 1794, during the [[Northwest Indian War]]. They found justification for these actions in the unstable and extremely tense situation that existed in the area following the war, in the failure of the United States government to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for their losses, and in the British need for time to liquidate various assets in the region.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu0hgVoIj3UC&pg=PA17 |title=Historic Fort York, 1793\u20131993 |first=Carl |last=Benn |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-920474-79-2 |page=17}}</ref> All posts were relinquished peacefully through diplomatic means as a result of the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]].

France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it could [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|capture Gibraltar]] from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that would be set up an independent [[Indian barrier state]] under Spanish control.<ref>Smith, Dwight L. \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Americans realized that they could get a better deal directly from London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in charge of the British negotiations (some of which took place in his study at Lansdowne House, now a bar in the Lansdowne Club) and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref name=ritcheson>{{cite journal |last=Ritcheson |first=Charles R. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40105313?seq=1 |title=The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality |journal=[[The International History Review]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |date=August 1983 |pages=322\u2013345 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

Historians such as  Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States.  The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants,  without any military or administrative costs to Britain.<ref name=ritcheson/>  The point was the United States would become a major trading partner. As the French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] later put it, \"The English buy peace rather than make it\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Vermont was included within the boundaries because the state of New York insisted that Vermont was a part of New York, although Vermont was then under a [[Vermont Republic|government that considered Vermont not to be a part of the United States]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel Flagg |authorlink=Samuel Flagg Bemis |last=Bemis |title=The Diplomacy of the American Revolution |year=1957 |publisher=Indiana University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/diplomacyofameri00bemi|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nPrivileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status (including protection from [[Barbary corsairs#United States and the Barbary Wars|pirates]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; see: the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]) were withdrawn. Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also ignored Article 6  (e.g., by confiscating Loyalist property for \"unpaid debts\"). Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors. The British often ignored the provision of Article 7  about removal of slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=James W. |last=Ely Jr. |title=The Guardian of Every Other Right: A Constitutional History of Property Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBXuRfB4DH4C&pg=PA35 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=35 |isbn=978-0199724529}}</ref>\n\nThe actual [[geography of North America]] turned out not to match the details used in the treaty. The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain. While that [[West Florida Controversy]] continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFyLOUrdGFwC&pg=PA23 |title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913 |first=Howard |last=Jones |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8420-2916-2 |page=23}}</ref> The treaty stated that the boundary of the United States extended from the \"[[Northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods|most northwesternmost point]]\" of the [[Lake of the Woods]] (now partly in Minnesota, partly in Manitoba, and partly in Ontario) directly westward until it reached the Mississippi River.  But in fact the Mississippi does not extend that far northward; the line going west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the river.\n\nGreat Britain violated the treaty stipulation that they should relinquish control of forts in United States territory \"with all convenient speed.\" British troops remained stationed at six forts in the [[Great Lakes region]], plus two at the north end of [[Lake Champlain]]. The British also built an additional fort in present-day Ohio in 1794, during the [[Northwest Indian War]]. They found justification for these actions in the unstable and extremely tense situation that existed in the area following the war, in the failure of the United States government to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for their losses, and in the British need for time to liquidate various assets in the region.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu0hgVoIj3UC&pg=PA17 |title=Historic Fort York, 1793\u20131993 |first=Carl |last=Benn |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-920474-79-2 |page=17}}</ref> All posts were relinquished peacefully through diplomatic means as a result of the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]].

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n===Quotative inversion===\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example: while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example: two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; they demonstrate something that another person said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech.

In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

For example, English can express evidentials with optional adverbs, \"Allegedly, Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows that this is information from a secondary source.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353-370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example: while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example: two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; they demonstrate something that another person said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005. p.222. </ref> In conversation, the use of ''\"say\"'' and ''\"be like\"'' are about the same frequency <ref> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005. p.240. </ref> ; yet, in more normal situation, for instance office hours between professors and students, will more like to use ''\"say\"'' than ''\"be like\"''. <ref> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005. p.242. </ref> \n\nHere are some examples of ''\"be like\"'': <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Quotative inversion====\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguisic variations====\n=====Quotative verbs=====\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech. Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with optional adverbs, \"Allegedly, Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows that this is information from a secondary source.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353-370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
