Nicknamed by employees the \"Sun King\" for his management style, he was also praised for increasing BP's interest in [[renewable energy]] sources. He resigned from BP in May 2007 in controversial circumstances surrounding his personal life.\n\nHe is a former President of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]<ref name=\"List of Fellows\"/> (2006 to July 2011). Since 2001, he has been a [[crossbencher|crossbench]] member of the [[House of Lords]]. Lord Browne is a former Partner of Riverstone, which is co-owner of [[Cuadrilla Resources|Cuadrilla resources]]. He received his undergraduate education at the [[University of Cambridge]] and later attended [[Stanford University]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrowne was born on 20 February 1948 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. His father was a [[British Army]] officer who later worked for Anglo-Persian Oil (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) in 1935), which later became British Petroleum. His mother, Paula, was a Hungarian Jewish [[Auschwitz]] survivor.<ref name=\"jclearningfrom\">{{cite news| url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-features/109178/learning-past-and-my-survivor-mother |work=The Jewish Chronicle | title=Learning from the past - and my survivor mother | first=Simon | last=Rocker | date=2 July 2013 | accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"DT1210\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/8057523/Lord-Brownes-tuition-fees-report-published-a-profile-of-the-former-BP-chief.html|title=Lord Browne: profile of the former BP chief|publisher=The Daily Telegraph, UK|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=12 October 2010 | location=London | first=Heidi | last=Blake}}</ref> Many members of Browne's Jewish maternal family, including his grandparents, were murdered at the Birkenau concentration camp during [[The Holocaust]].<ref name=\"glasscloset22\">{{cite book |last=Browne |first=John |date=2014 |title=The Glass Closet: Why Coming Out Is Good Business |location=London, UK |publisher=WH Allen |page=22 |isbn=9780753555330}}</ref>\n\nBrowne was educated at [[the King's School, Ely]], and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he earned a [[First class degree|First Class]] [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in Physics. In addition to his degree in Physics from the [[University of Cambridge]], he holds an [[Master of Science|MS]] degree in Business from [[Stanford University|Stanford University, California]].\n\n==Career at BP==\nAt the suggestion of his father, Browne joined [[BP]] as an apprentice in 1966 while still at university. He remained with the corporation throughout his career.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1983, he held a variety of exploration and production posts in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], New York, San Francisco, London and Canada. In 1984 he became Group Treasurer and Chief Executive of BP Finance International. In April 1986, he took up the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In 1987, following the BP/Standard merger, in addition to his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BP America, he was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Standard Oil Production Company. In 1989, he became Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of [[BP]] Exploration based in London. In September 1991, he joined BP's board as a Managing Director.\n\nHe was appointed Group Chief Executive on 10 June 1995 after the British government sold its last remaining stake in the company.  Following the merger of BP and [[Amoco]], he became Group Chief Executive of the combined group on 31 December 1998 and served until 1 May 2007. He was one of the most highly paid executives in the UK, with a remuneration package of approximately \u00a35.7 million in 2004.\n\nFrom 1997, Browne sought to re-brand BP.<ref name=\"DT1210\" /> The company linked itself in its corporate communications with green issues by the overt link of its BP initials with the phrase \"Beyond Petroleum\". Browne stated that the right to self-determination was crucial for people everywhere, and that he saw his company's mission as to find ways to meet current needs without excessive harm to the environment, while developing future, more sustainable sources of energy.

Nicknamed by employees the \"Sun King\" for his management style, he was also praised for increasing BP's interest in [[renewable energy]] sources. He resigned from BP in May 2007 in controversial circumstances surrounding his personal life.\n\nHe is a former President of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]<ref name=\"List of Fellows\"/> (2006 to July 2011).

His father was a [[British Army]] officer who later worked for Anglo-Persian Oil (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) in 1935), which later became British Petroleum.

In addition to his degree in Physics from the [[University of Cambridge]], he holds an [[Master of Science|MS]] degree in Business from [[Stanford University|Stanford University, California]].\n\n==Career at BP==\nAt the suggestion of his father, Browne joined [[BP]] as an apprentice in 1966 while still at university. He remained with the corporation throughout his career.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1983, he held a variety of exploration and production posts in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], New York, San Francisco, London and Canada. In 1984 he became Group Treasurer and Chief Executive of BP Finance International. In April 1986, he took up the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In 1987, following the BP/Standard merger, in addition to his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BP America, he was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Standard Oil Production Company. In 1989, he became Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of [[BP]] Exploration based in London. In September 1991, he joined BP's board as a Managing Director.\n\nHe was appointed Group Chief Executive on 10 June 1995 after the British government sold its last remaining stake in the company.  Following the merger of BP and [[Amoco]], he became Group Chief Executive of the combined group on 31 December 1998 and served until 1 May 2007. He was one of the most highly paid executives in the UK, with a remuneration package of approximately \u00a35.7 million in 2004.\n\nFrom 1997, Browne sought to re-brand BP.<ref name=\"DT1210\" /> The company linked itself in its corporate communications with green issues by the overt link of its BP initials with the phrase \"Beyond Petroleum\". Browne stated that the right to self-determination was crucial for people everywhere, and that he saw his company's mission as to find ways to meet current needs without excessive harm to the environment, while developing future, more sustainable sources of energy. He promised that BP would cut its production of [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] by 10% by 2010; it is as yet unproved whether BP met this goal in the wake of Browne's departure (2007).\n\n===Resignation===\nIt was announced on 25 July 2006 that Browne would stand down as chief executive of BP in December 2008. There had been press speculation that he had wished to continue beyond this date, but he made it clear that he did not wish to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/25/oilandpetrol.money|title=Browne to retire from BP in 2008|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=25 July 2016|website=The Guardian|access-date=4 January 2017}}</ref> On 6 January 2007, Browne won his first interim [[injunction]] against the publication of allegations by his former partner, Jeff Chevalier.

He was raised to the peerage by [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] in 1893, and in 1905 was granted the [[Freedom of the City]] of [[Rutherglen]] (where his chemical works was based), following being honoured in the same fashion by [[Dumbarton]] two years earlier, in recognition of his philanthropic endeavours. \n\nWhite's persona as a generous and committed Scottish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] was at odds with his exploitation of the workers at his Shawfield Chemical Works, the source of his great wealth. Politician and leader of the nascent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Keir Hardie]], exposed the scandalous working conditions there in a series of pamphlets published in 1899 entitled ''White Slaves''.\n\n==Background and education==\nLord Overtoun's father, [[James White (1812-1884)|James White]] of [[Overtoun House|Overtoun]] (1812\u20131884) was originally a lawyer, who had left the legal profession to join John & James White, chemical manufacturers, a firm founded by his father and uncle at Rutherglen in 1810. He was chief administrator of the fund set up for the sufferers of the [[City of Glasgow Bank]] collapse in 1878. After his death, citizens of Glasgow erected a statue of him at [[Cathedral Square, Glasgow]].\n\nJohn White was born at [[Shawfield|Hayfield]], near [[Rutherglen]], [[Lanarkshire]], the only son of James White by Fanny Campbell, daughter of Alexander Campbell, Sheriff of [[Renfrewshire]], of Barnhill, [[Dunbartonshire]]. He had six sisters. He was educated at Stow's Academy, Glasgow, and at the [[University of Glasgow]]. He won prizes in [[logic]] and [[natural philosophy]]. He came into close contact with [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], the future Lord Kelvin, and worked in his laboratory for a year.<ref name=\"whoswho\">[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/eyrwho/eyrwho1311.htm THE LATE RIGHT HON. BARON OVERTOUN], Who's Who in Glasgow in 1909</ref>\n\n==Business life==\nWhite graduated in 1864, and worked for a year for his uncle's company, Mackenzie & Aitken, accountants, and then for a year and a half for Leisler, Bock & Co, continental merchants. He then joined his father's business, of which he became a partner in 1867. After his father's death in 1887 White and his cousin [[William James Chrystal|William Chrystal]] became sole partners in the [[Shawfield#J & J White Chemicals|Shawfield Chemical Works]], which was the largest of its kind in the world, employing about 500 men in 1909. The main product was [[potassium dichromate]], known then as bichromate of potash. His nephew H. H. Barrett was later admitted a partner.<ref name=\"whoswho\"/>\n\nLionel Alexander Ritchie, writing in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', remarks that \"He [Baron Overtoun] would be remembered solely for his peerless philanthropy and Christian zeal were it not for the fact that the source of his wealth was a chemical works where the wages and working conditions were scandalous.\"{{r|ODNB}} White led the Sunday Rest and Lord's Day Observance Society, but nevertheless insisted that his employees work seven days a week, and docked his workers' wages if they took time off to go to church. The millions he donated to various charitable causes came at least in part from paying his workers some of the lowest wages in the country.{{r|ChurchTimes}}\n\n===Public scandal===\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Keir Hardie]] took an interest in the working conditions of labourers in the chemical industry, and in 1899 exposed conditions at White's works in a series of pamphlets entitled ''White Slaves'', published in ''The Labour Leader'' and distributed in their thousands.{{r|Walker}} Safety regulations introduced in 1893 were largely ignored, and workers were forced to operate in unventilated areas without effective protective equipment. So dangerous was the toxic dust to which they were exposed that they were known locally as \"White's Dead Men\".{{r|Walker}}\n\nIn response to the various claims about working conditions [[Thomas Legge]], the first Medical Inspector of Factories, visited White's chemical works and others. His report published in 1900 concluded that 83 per cent of workers in chrome factories suffered from a perforated or ulcerated [[septum]], and 22 per cent from unhealed chrome holes, deep ulcerations of the skin, sometimes even penetrating as deep as the bone. The public scandal facing White, along with an increasingly active trade union movement, forced White in 1901 to start the construction of new buildings for baths, lavatories, dining and cloakroom facilities.{{r|Walker}}\n\n==Religious affairs==\nWhite was a supporter of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]], and donated a mission hall in [[Dunbarton]]. He was greatly involved in the union with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1900 which led to the formation of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. In 1874 he became strongly influenced by the evangelical preachings of [[D. L. Moody]]. After Moody's departure from Great Britain the Glasgow United Evangelistic Association was set up, of which White became president. He was one of the leading powers behind the construction of the Association's building in Bothwell Street, Glasgow, at a cost of more than \u00a3100,000. The building housed the Bible Training Institute, the Young Men's Christian Association and Young Men's Christian Club. He also led bible classes at [[Dunbarton]] and preached throughout Great Britain.<ref name=\"whoswho\"/>\n\n==Politics==\nWhite was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] in politics and served as Chairman of the Dunbartonshire Liberal Association and as a Vice-President of the [[Scottish Liberal Association]]. When the Liberal Party split over [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Irish Home Rule]] in 1886, he followed [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. He declined to stand as the Liberal candidate for [[Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire]] in 1889 but took an active part in supporting [[John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland|John Sinclair]]'s candidature in the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892 general election]], in which 50 years of Conservative domination in the constituency was broken. In 1893, on the recommendation of Gladstone,<ref name=\"whoswho\"/> he was raised to the peerage as Baron Overtoun, of Overtoun in the County of Dumbarton.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=26415 |date=23 June 1893 |page=3570 }}</ref> In 1906 his nephew [[James Dundas White]] was returned for Dunbartonshire.

So dangerous was the toxic dust to which they were exposed that they were known locally as \"White's Dead Men\".{{r|Walker}}\n\nIn response to the various claims about working conditions [[Thomas Legge]], the first Medical Inspector of Factories, visited White's chemical works and others. His report published in 1900 concluded that 83 per cent of workers in chrome factories suffered from a perforated or ulcerated [[septum]], and 22 per cent from unhealed chrome holes, deep ulcerations of the skin, sometimes even penetrating as deep as the bone. The public scandal facing White, along with an increasingly active trade union movement, forced White in 1901 to start the construction of new buildings for baths, lavatories, dining and cloakroom facilities.{{r|Walker}}\n\n==Religious affairs==\nWhite was a supporter of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]], and donated a mission hall in [[Dunbarton]]. He was greatly involved in the union with the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] in 1900 which led to the formation of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. In 1874 he became strongly influenced by the evangelical preachings of [[D. L. Moody]]. After Moody's departure from Great Britain the Glasgow United Evangelistic Association was set up, of which White became president. He was one of the leading powers behind the construction of the Association's building in Bothwell Street, Glasgow, at a cost of more than \u00a3100,000. The building housed the Bible Training Institute, the Young Men's Christian Association and Young Men's Christian Club. He also led bible classes at [[Dunbarton]] and preached throughout Great Britain.<ref name=\"whoswho\"/>\n\n==Politics==\nWhite was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] in politics and served as Chairman of the Dunbartonshire Liberal Association and as a Vice-President of the [[Scottish Liberal Association]]. When the Liberal Party split over [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Irish Home Rule]] in 1886, he followed [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. He declined to stand as the Liberal candidate for [[Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire]] in 1889 but took an active part in supporting [[John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland|John Sinclair]]'s candidature in the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892 general election]], in which 50 years of Conservative domination in the constituency was broken. In 1893, on the recommendation of Gladstone,<ref name=\"whoswho\"/> he was raised to the peerage as Baron Overtoun, of Overtoun in the County of Dumbarton.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=26415 |date=23 June 1893 |page=3570 }}</ref> In 1906 his nephew [[James Dundas White]] was returned for Dunbartonshire.

McClure, a [[Glasgow]] [[solicitor]], in 1867. They had no children. He died at [[Overtoun House]] after a short illness in February 1908, aged 69,<ref name=\"whoswho\"/> leaving an estate of \u00a3689,022 (equivalent to \u00a3{{format price|{{inflation|UK|689022|1908|r=-3}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}{{inflation-fn|UK|group=lower-alpha|df=y|mode=cs2}}).

This Parliament has had an unusually large number of these changes, resulting in the number of MPs sitting as independents rising to its highest level (33) since the [[Ballot Act 1872]] (which introduced [[secret ballot]]s for [[elections in the United Kingdom]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe Conservative and Labour parties lost numerous MPs through suspensions and defections to other parties. In February 2019, 8 Labour and 3 Conservative MPs formed a new grouping (later a party in its own right), [[Change UK]]. That grouping experienced a split in June, with some of its members resigning to form [[The Independents (UK)|The Independents]]. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have made a gain of 8 seats since the opening of Parliament, including some former Change UK members. The government lost its majority on 3 September 2019, when the Conservative MP [[Phillip Lee (politician)|Phillip Lee]] defected to the Liberal Democrats. Later the same day, the Conservatives expelled 21 of their MPs for voting against the government, 10 of whom were later readmitted to the party on 29 October.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Date\n!colspan=\"2\"|From\n!colspan=\"2\"|To\n!Constituency\n!width=\"40%\"|Reason\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Anne Marie Morris]]\n|{{dts|10 July 2017}}\n|{{Party name with color|Conservative Party (UK)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Newton Abbot (UK Parliament constituency)|Newton Abbot]]\n|Suspended from the Conservatives, pending investigation over using the remark \"[[nigger in the woodpile]]\".<ref>{{cite news|title=MP Anne Marie Morris suspended for racist remark |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40555639|work=[[BBC News]]|date= 10 July 2017|accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{dts|12 December 2017}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Conservative Party (UK)}}\n|Reinstated.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42322022|title=Anne Marie Morris: Tory MP has whip restored after racist remark|date=12 December 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Jared O'Mara]]\n|{{dts|25 October 2017}}\n|{{Party name with color|Labour Party (UK)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]]\n|Suspended from Labour, pending investigation over alleged sexist and homophobic remarks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41750136|title=Labour suspends MP after online comments|date=25 October 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{dts|3 July 2018}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Labour Party (UK)}}\n|Reinstated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-44698077 |title=Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O'Mara reinstated by Labour |date=3 July 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018 |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{dts|12 July 2018}}\n|{{Party name with color|Labour Party (UK)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|Resigned from Labour.<ref name=\"O'Mara open\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.jaredomara.co.uk/recentactivity/2018/7/12/an-open-letter-to-my-constituents |title=An open letter to my constituents |author= O'Mara, Jared |date=12 July 2018 |website=Jared O'Mara MP |access-date=24 July 2018|author-link=Jared O'Mara }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Kelvin Hopkins]]\n|{{dts|2 November 2017}}\n|{{Party name with color|Labour Party (UK)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|[[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]]\n|Suspended from Labour, pending investigation into sexual allegations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41853430 |title=Labour suspends Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins|work=[[BBC News]]|date= 3 November 2017|access-date= 25 July 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Charlie Elphicke]]\n|{{dts|3 November 2017}}\n|{{Party name with color|Conservative Party (UK)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Dover (UK Parliament constituency)|Dover]]\n|Suspended from the Conservatives, pending police investigation of \"serious allegations\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41866970| title=Tory MP Charlie Elphicke suspended after 'serious allegations'|work=[[BBC News]]|date= 4 November 2017|access-date= 25 July 2018 }}</ref>\n|-\n|{{dts|12 December 2018}}\n|{{Party name with color|Independent (politician)}}\n|{{Party name with color|Conservative Party (UK)}}\n|Reinstated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1072878628537552899|title=Two suspended Tory MPs get whip back for tonight's big vote \u2013 Elphicke and Griffiths.

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] consists of the [[House of Lords]] and the elected House of Commons.

This left both Parliament and the [[HM Government|Government]] in a prolonged state of deadlock and unable to move forward. Consequently there was a unusually high number of defections and suspensions, including the [[September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs|suspension of 21 Conservative MPs in September 2019]]; 10 of those suspended MPs re-joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in October 2019. The Parliament was dissolved after the Government passed the [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]], which bypassed the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] to bring the next election forward to December 2019 from its original scheduled May 2022 date.\n\n==House of Commons composition==\nBelow are graphical representations of the House of Commons showing party strengths directly after the 2017 general election, at important intermediate points, and immediately prior to dissolution. This is not an actual seating plan of the House, which has only five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons]] and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time. \n{|width=600px\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"slideshow\" caption=\"57th UK House of Commons\">\nFile:UK House of Commons 2017 2018-12-19.svg|As at dissolution (see image description page for date)\nFile:UK House of Commons 2017 2019-02-18.svg|18 February 2019 (following the initial Labour defections to the Independent Group)\nFile:UK House of Commons 2018-12-19.svg|19 December 2018\nFile:UK House of Commons 2017-06-26.svg|26 June 2017\n</gallery>\n|}\nThis table shows the number of MPs in each party:\n{|  class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" class=unsortable style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;\"| Affiliation\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|  Members<ref>{{cite web|title=Current State of the Parties|url=https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/|publisher=[[UK Parliament]]|accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! data-sort-type=number|[[2017 United Kingdom general election|At 2017 election]]\n! data-sort-type=number|At dissolution\n!

The [[Co-operative Party]] was represented in the House of Commons by Labour MPs sitting with the [[Labour and Co-operative]] designation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://party.coop/about/|title=About the Party|publisher=[[Co-operative Party]]|language=en-GB|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref>\n*\"Members elected\" refers to the composition resulting from the election on 8 June 2017, but note that the [[confidence and supply]] arrangement (C&S) was [[2017 United Kingdom general election|only reached on 26 June]].\n*The \"voting total\" is the effective size of the House excluding vacancies, suspensions, and certain members (ten at dissolution): the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], two (usually three) [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)#Deputies|Deputy Speakers]] (one Labour and one Conservative) who had only a tie-breaking vote constrained by conventions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ties.html|title=House of Commons: Tied Divisions|website=United Kingdom Election Results|author= Boothroyd, David|access-date=25 July 2018}}</ref> and seven [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] members (Sinn F\u00e9in). This left relevant party voting totals as follows: Con 297, Lab 241, SF 0, Speaker 0.\n*The \"safe majority\" (the number of seats needed to have a majority of one or two), \"Gov short by\" (the margin by which the governing Conservatives are short of that majority), and \"Gov + C&S total\" are based on the voting totals. The government entered into a confidence and supply agreement to secure a small majority, which shrank due to defections, finally disappearing on 3 September 2019. Hence, the \"Gov + C&S majority\", calculated as the sum of voting Conservative and Democratic Unionist Party members, less the sum of all other voting members, was negative at dissolution.\n\n==List of MPs elected in the general election==\nThe following table is a list of MPs elected, ordered by constituency.
