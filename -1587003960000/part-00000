He studied architecture at UASD before moving to New York where he graduated from Parsons School of Design and began his career in fashion as Oscar de la Renta\u2019s assistant. He then worked as a designer for the houses of Bill Blass and Eli Tahari before starting his namesake collection in 1998, retailing at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and other better stores around the world. He later returned to Oscar de la Renta as creative director for the O Oscar Collection. In 2000 Sully Bonnelly Accents was launched, an exclusive collection for Home Shopping Network (HSN) and HSN en Espanol, making him the first Latin American designer featured on a shopping network. In 2001 Bonnelly served as Creative Director for Citrine, a contemporary sportswear collection. Two years later the Sully Bonnelly Bridal collection was launched. In 1999 he received the Golden Coast Award, a prestigious fashion award in Chicago. In 2001 was elected member to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) joining an important community of over 300 American fashion and accessory designers. Additionally, he has been honored by several Dominican organizations for his outstanding work in fashion. New York Governor George Pataki honored him in 2005 in celebration of Dominican Heritage Month. Most recently Bonnelly received the Orden al Merito Ciudadano, a recognition given to Dominicans all over the world who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers and done honor to their homeland. Past honorees include: the authors Junot Diaz and Julia Alvarez, the musician Michael Camilo and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Today, Sully Bonnelly is Creative Director for Isaac Mizrahi  Sportswear, Eveningwear and Dresses. Memories of his travels around the world infuse all his designs, forming his imaginary scrapbook of colors, textures, rhythms and fragrances.

He studied architecture at UASD before moving to New York where he graduated from Parsons School of Design and began his career in fashion as Oscar de la Renta\u2019s assistant. He then worked as a designer for the houses of Bill Blass and Eli Tahari before starting his namesake collection in 1998, retailing at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and other better stores around the world. He later returned to Oscar de la Renta as creative director for the O Oscar Collection. In 2000 Sully Bonnelly Accents was launched, an exclusive collection for Home Shopping Network (HSN) and HSN en Espanol, making him the first Latin American designer featured on a shopping network. In 2001 Bonnelly served as Creative Director for Citrine, a contemporary sportswear collection. Two years later the Sully Bonnelly Bridal collection was launched. In 1999 he received the Golden Coast Award, a prestigious fashion award in Chicago. In 2001 was elected member to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) joining an important community of over 300 American fashion and accessory designers. Additionally, he has been honored by several Dominican organizations for his outstanding work in fashion. New York Governor George Pataki honored him in 2005 in celebration of Dominican Heritage Month. Most recently Bonnelly received the Orden al Merito Ciudadano, a recognition given to Dominicans all over the world who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers and done honor to their homeland. Past honorees include: the authors Junot Diaz and Julia Alvarez, the musician Michael Camilo and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Today, Sully Bonnelly is Creative Director for Isaac Mizrahi  Sportswear, Eveningwear and Dresses. Memories of his travels around the world infuse all his designs, forming his imaginary scrapbook of colors, textures, rhythms and fragrances. These inspirations materialize into exciting designs that instill in women who wear them a feeling of well being and self-confidence.\n\n=== Other notable accomplishments ===\nIn 2001, Bonnelly held the position as Creative Director for Citrine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico Moda |url=http://www.puertoricomoda.com/REVISTA_PR_MODA_Rev6%5B1%5D.pdf |publisher=Puerto Rica Moda |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2002, he designed<ref>{{cite web|title=Museo Celia Cruz|url=http://www.megalatina.fm/eventos/museo-celia-cruz/|publisher=Mega Latina|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> [[Celia Cruz]]'s dress for the [[Latin Grammy Awards]].

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels, as well as an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 cars were produced in total.  The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1983\u201384.  A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and [[wholesaling|wholesale]] customers by mail order.

October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, US) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> Much like the [[scissor doors|doors]] fitted to the [[Lamborghini Countach]], the DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving.

These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe model]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

The college was established in 1847 by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and has a strong focus on Quaker values such as integrity, a commitment to peace and social justice, mutual respect, and community decision-making. It is primarily a residential undergraduate college but it offers a [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] and has an affiliated graduate seminary, the [[Earlham School of Religion]], which offers three master's degrees: a [[Master of Divinity]], Master of Ministry, and [[Master of Arts in Religion]].\n\n==History==\nEarlham was founded in 1847 as a boarding high school for the religious education of Quaker adolescents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/about/history|title=A Brief History of Earlham College|publisher=Earlham.edu|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> In 1859, Earlham became Earlham College, upon the addition of collegiate academics. At this time, Earlham was the third Quaker college in the [[United States]] ([[Haverford College]] was first, [[Guilford College]] the second), and the second U.S. institution of higher education to be coeducational ([[Oberlin College]] was first). Though the college initially only admitted students who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, Earlham began admitting non-Quakers in 1865. The college was named for [[Earlham Hall]], home of the [[Joseph John Gurney|Gurneys]], an important English Quaker family.\n\nOver time, as Quakerism in America became more progressive, Earlham's practices changed with them, though the college has remained faithful to its Quaker roots. In 1942 Earlham enrolled several dozen Japanese-American students to prevent their [[Japanese American internment|internment]] during [[World War II]], a decision that was very controversial in Richmond. 1960 marked the establishment of the [[Earlham School of Religion]], then the only Friends [[seminary]] in the world.\n\nEarlham College has been facing declining revenues for years.<ref name=\"pal-item.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/08/09/amid-financial-strains-earlham-banks-100-million-campus-updates/885145002/|title=Amid financial strains, Earlham puts $100 million into campus updates|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/07/29/earlham-faces-big-questions-deficit-ahead-new-school-year/828182002/|title=Earlham College faces big deficit, questions ahead of new school year|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref name=\"pal-item.com\"/>\n\n==Campus==\nEarlham's {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus lies at the southwestern edge of [[Richmond, Indiana]], a city of 36,812 (2010 census).

This equates to roughly 200 students, which is the highest total number of international students for any co-educational liberal arts college in the country. This high diversity is due in part to a strong relationship with the [[United World College]] network of international boarding high schools. Since 2004, Earlham College has been a part of the Davis United World Scholars program, which offers need-based scholarships for UWC graduates to continue their education at select institutions in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/alumni/whats-happening/news/?id=13468&r=3867|title=Earlham Joins Worldwide 50th Anniversary Celebration for United World Colleges|publisher=earlham.edu|accessdate=2013-02-17}}</ref> The Davis Cup, which is awarded to the college with the most current students from this program, has been awarded to Earlham several times.

Students have taken ice climbing, dog sledding, caving, white water kayaking, rock climbing, trail construction and canoeing courses for credit. The program in the past has led spring break canoeing trips to  [[Big Bend National Park]] in southwestern [[Texas]], a semester course to  New Zealand and a  May Term (a condensed three-week term after the spring semester) instructor training  course for its August Wilderness program. Challenge/experiential education courses on the college's own high and low ropes is offered as well as the chance to be certified as a Wilderness First Responders in an intensive spring break course where students must complete mock rescues.

The college was established in 1847 by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and has a strong focus on Quaker values such as integrity, a commitment to peace and social justice, mutual respect, and community decision-making. It is primarily a residential undergraduate college but it offers a [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] and has an affiliated graduate seminary, the [[Earlham School of Religion]], which offers three master's degrees: a [[Master of Divinity]], Master of Ministry, and [[Master of Arts in Religion]].\n\n==History==\nEarlham was founded in 1847 as a boarding high school for the religious education of Quaker adolescents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/about/history|title=A Brief History of Earlham College|publisher=Earlham.edu|accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> In 1859, Earlham became Earlham College, upon the addition of collegiate academics. At this time, Earlham was the third Quaker college in the [[United States]] ([[Haverford College]] was first, [[Guilford College]] the second), and the second U.S. institution of higher education to be coeducational ([[Oberlin College]] was first). Though the college initially only admitted students who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, Earlham began admitting non-Quakers in 1865. The college was named for [[Earlham Hall]], home of the [[Joseph John Gurney|Gurneys]], an important English Quaker family.\n\nOver time, as Quakerism in America became more progressive, Earlham's practices changed with them, though the college has remained faithful to its Quaker roots. In 1942 Earlham enrolled several dozen Japanese-American students to prevent their [[Japanese American internment|internment]] during [[World War II]], a decision that was very controversial in Richmond. 1960 marked the establishment of the [[Earlham School of Religion]], then the only Friends [[seminary]] in the world.\n\nEarlham College has been facing declining revenues for years.<ref name=\"pal-item.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/08/09/amid-financial-strains-earlham-banks-100-million-campus-updates/885145002/|title=Amid financial strains, Earlham puts $100 million into campus updates|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pal-item.com/story/news/local/2018/07/29/earlham-faces-big-questions-deficit-ahead-new-school-year/828182002/|title=Earlham College faces big deficit, questions ahead of new school year|website=Pal-Item}}</ref><ref name=\"pal-item.com\"/>\n\n==Campus==\nEarlham's {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus lies at the southwestern edge of [[Richmond, Indiana]], a city of 36,812 (2010 census).

In addition, there are a number of shorter off-campus May terms, with destinations both within the U.S. and abroad ([[Australia]], [[Galapagos]], [[Senegal]], [[Menorca]], and [[Turkey]], as recent examples). Earlham has an exchange program with [[Waseda University]] in [[Japan]], which has existed since 1963. In addition, Earlham College offers the [[SICE]] program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/curriculumguide/offcampus/programs.html|title=Earlham College - A national liberal arts college in the Midwest|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> in [[Morioka, Japan|Morioka]], Japan, a program in which about twelve to fourteen students teach [[English language|English]] in [[middle school]]s in [[Morioka]]. Students prepare for these programs by studying German, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, French and Chinese which are offered on campus during the school year. Tibetan, Creole, and Kiswalli have been offered during some of these off campus programs.\n\nIn the sciences, Earlham places a large emphasis on integrating research into the undergraduate curriculum. Through Ford/Knight grants, most science faculty have been or are currently involved with students in research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/curriculum-guide/elective-opportunities/studentfaculty-research|title=Student/Faculty Research|accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref> Earlham has good representation in the [[Butler University|Butler]] Undergraduate Research Conference, held each year in the spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.butler.edu/media/1196327/program2011_rev.pdf|title=2011 Butler Undergraduate Research Conference Schedule|access-date=2011-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406090728/http://www.butler.edu/media/1196327/program2011_rev.pdf|archive-date=2012-04-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[pre-medicine]] program is particularly distinguished, in that over the last ten years all but one of its graduates have been accepted into medical school. Earlham's biology and chemistry departments have a long history of producing distinguished graduates, such as [[Warder Clyde Allee]], [[Jim Fowler]], [[Larry E. Overman]], [[Harold Urey]], and [[Wendell Stanley]], the latter two of which won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (in 1934 and 1946, respectively). Students and Faculty in Earlham's CS applied groups jointly provide computer infrastructure support for the college.\n\nThe [[choir]] department organizes regional and national tours every year for its ensembles.

This equates to roughly 200 students, which is the highest total number of international students for any co-educational liberal arts college in the country. This high diversity is due in part to a strong relationship with the [[United World College]] network of international boarding high schools. Since 2004, Earlham College has been a part of the Davis United World Scholars program, which offers need-based scholarships for UWC graduates to continue their education at select institutions in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/alumni/whats-happening/news/?id=13468&r=3867|title=Earlham Joins Worldwide 50th Anniversary Celebration for United World Colleges|publisher=earlham.edu|accessdate=2013-02-17}}</ref> The Davis Cup, which is awarded to the college with the most current students from this program, has been awarded to Earlham several times.

Lessons are available for students of the college and community members. The equestrian center is adjacent to the college owned 11 acre Miller farm which hosts agricultural interns during the school year and summer and \"work days\" on Saturdays for the rest of the community during the school year.

The program is divided into the Water August Wilderness and the Mountain August Wilderness and lasts for approximately three weeks; the former canoes in [[Wabakimi Provincial Park]] in Ontario and the latter hikes in the Uinta Mountains in Utah. Students have taken ice climbing, dog sledding, caving, white water kayaking, rock climbing, trail construction and canoeing courses for credit. The program in the past has led spring break canoeing trips to  [[Big Bend National Park]] in southwestern [[Texas]], a semester course to  New Zealand and a  May Term (a condensed three-week term after the spring semester) instructor training  course for its August Wilderness program. Challenge/experiential education courses on the college's own high and low ropes is offered as well as the chance to be certified as a Wilderness First Responders in an intensive spring break course where students must complete mock rescues.

Seesock, was a parasol wing, open cockpit four-seater, offered with a choice of engines. Its wings were rectangular in plan out to tips tapered on their [[leading edge]]s and were built around twin, solid [[spar (aeronautics)|spars]] and [[plywood]] [[rib (aeronautics)|ribs]], with [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covering]].<ref name=AeroD/> They were joined to the lower fuselage [[longerons]] by parallel pairs of [[strut]]s<ref name=AeroD1/> to the spars at about 2/3 span. These had a broad [[chord (aeronautics)|chord]], [[airfoil]] section and, with a combined area of {{cvt|35.5|sqft|m2}}, made a useful contribution to the Pacer's lift. The wing centre-section was held over the fuselage with pairs of longitudinal, vertical, inverted-V [[cabane strut]]s from the spars to the upper fuselage longerons on each side.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\nThe Pacer was designed to accept a variety of engines with outputs greater than about {{cvt|100|hp|kW}} but the first flights were made with a licence-built [[Hispano-Suiza 8]], a water-cooled [[V8 engine|V-8]] dating from 1914 developed to produce {{cvt|180|hp|kW}}. It had a \"tunnel type\" [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] mounted under the engine and a {{cvt|90|USgal|Impgal l}} fuel tank in the wing centre-section. Behind the engine the fuselage had a flat-sided, welded steel tube structure with fabric covering. The upper fuselage had a curved decking. Each wide, open cockpit seated two side-by-side; the forward cockpit, under the wing, was accessed through a door and the rear, from which it was flown, was almost under a [[trailing edge]] gently cut away to improve the upward, forward field of view and offered dual controls with a Y-type, central column. Aft, a straight-tapered, round-tipped tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a pair of parallel struts to the lower longeron on each side. The [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]] were similar in plan but with a large cut-out for rudder movement. The fin was trapezoidal in profile and its round-topped [[balanced rudder]] had a vertical trailing edge.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\nIts split-axle main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] had its steel tube axles, legs and drag struts mounted on the lower longerons. The wheels were large and the track wide. There was a short tailskid.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\n==Operational History== \n\nThe date of the first flight is not known but was well before April 1928, when some results of test flights with the Hispano engine, including a trial carrying four and their baggage, had been released. Pacer intended production at their [[Fords, New Jersey]] factory to begin on 15 April<ref name=AeroD/> and had appointed two agencies committed to purchase production aircraft, one to cover [[New York City|New York]] and the other [[New York State]]. At the same time a Whirlwind-powered airframe was being completed for the Detroit Air Show and for flight shortly afterwords.<ref name=AeroD2/> Production continued until 1930,<ref name=GunstonMan/> though only two are known from US civil registers.

The 18th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on the [[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|novel of the same name]], which was first published in 1938 as a single novel. It was later republished in 1958 as the first book of [[T. H. White]]'s [[tetralogy]] ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. With story written by [[Bill Peet]] and directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the film features the voices of [[Rickie Sorensen]], [[Karl Swenson]], [[Junius Matthews]], [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]], [[Norman Alden]], and [[Martha Wentworth]].\n\nWalt Disney first acquired the film rights to the novel in 1939, and various attempts at developing the film would last two decades before actual production on the film officially began. ''The Sword in the Stone'' would be the last animated film from Walt Disney Productions to be produced by Walt Disney before his death on December 15, 1966. The songs in the film were written and composed by the [[Sherman Brothers]], who later wrote music for other Disney films like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.\n\n''The Sword in the Stone'' was released to theaters on December 25, 1963 to mixed reviews, though it was a box office success. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1983 as a double feature with ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]''.\n\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action remake]] of the film directed by [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] entered development in 2015, and will be released on [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Disney's 'Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake Finds Director (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-remake-disney-hires-director-1075997|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 19, 2018|access-date=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 533 words. -->\nAfter the [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], [[Uther Pendragon]], dies, leaving no [[heir]] to the throne, a [[Excalibur|sword]] appears inside an anvil in London, with an inscription proclaiming that whoever removes it is the rightful King of England. None succeed in removing the sword, which becomes forgotten, leaving England in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].\n\nYears later, a 12-year-old orphan named Arthur, commonly called Wart, accidentally scares off a deer his older foster brother [[Sir Kay|Kay]] was hunting, causing Kay to launch his arrow into the forest. In attempting to retrieve the arrow, Arthur meets [[Merlin]], an elderly [[magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who lives with his talking pet owl Archimedes. Merlin declares himself Arthur's tutor and returns with him to his home, a castle run by [[Sir Ector]], Arthur's foster father. Ector's friend, [[Pellinore|Sir Pellinore]], arrives to announce that the annual [[jousting]] tournament will be held in London, and the winner will be crowned king. Ector decides to put Kay through serious training for the tournament and appoints Arthur as Kay's [[squire]].\n\nIn order to educate Arthur, Merlin transforms the boy and himself into [[fish]]. They swim in the castle moat in order to learn about [[reaction (physics)|physics]]. After the lesson, Arthur is sent to the kitchen as punishment for attempting to relate his lesson to a disbelieving Ector. Merlin enchants the dishes to wash themselves, then takes Arthur for another lesson, turning them into [[tree squirrel]]s to learn about [[gravity]]. After they return to human form, Ector accuses Merlin of using [[black magic]] on the dishes. Arthur defiantly defends Merlin, but Ector refuses to listen and punishes Arthur by giving Kay another squire, Hobbs. Resolving to make amends, Merlin plans on educating Arthur full-time. However, Merlin's knowledge of future history confuses Arthur, prompting Merlin to appoint Archimedes as Arthur's teacher. Merlin transforms Arthur into a [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]] and Archimedes teaches him how to [[flight|fly]]. Soon after, Arthur encounters Madam Mim, an eccentric, evil witch who is Merlin's nemesis. Merlin arrives to rescue Arthur, and Mim challenges Merlin to a Wizards' Duel. Despite Mim's cheating, Merlin outsmarts her by transforming into a [[microorganism|germ]] that infects Mim, thus illustrating the importance of knowledge over strength. On [[Christmas Eve]], Kay is knighted, but Hobbs comes down with the [[mumps]]; therefore, Ector reinstates Arthur as Kay's squire. This causes Merlin to think that Arthur cares more about war games than having an education, and when Arthur defends his choices, Merlin angrily transports himself in time to [[20th century]] [[Bermuda]].\n\nOn the day of the tournament, Arthur realizes that he has left Kay's sword at an [[inn]], which is now closed for the tournament. Archimedes sees the legendary \"Sword in the Stone\" in a nearby churchyard, which Arthur removes almost effortlessly, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy. When Arthur returns with the sword, Ector recognizes it and the tournament is halted. Ector places the sword back in its anvil, demanding Arthur prove that he pulled it. He pulls it once again, revealing that he is England's rightful king. Later, the newly crowned king Arthur sits in the throne room with Archimedes, feeling unprepared for the responsibility of ruling, but Merlin returns from Bermuda and resolves to help Arthur become the great king that he has foreseen him to be.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Do not add links to pages that have not been written yet, per [[WP:REDNOT]].

Arthur was voiced by three actors, leading to noticeable changes in voice between scenes \u2014 and sometimes, within the same scene.

Merlin was voiced by [[Hamilton Camp]]. One notable appearance in the series was in the episode: \"Rent Day\", in which he tells [[Mickey Mouse]] that he will give him the 50 ups only if he gives Arthur a sword. Wart also made a few appearances in the series, usually seen in crowd shots with Merlin. He also appears with Merlin in the audience in the episode: \"Mickey vs. Shelby\" after a cartoon ends. Sir Kay was also seen in the episode: \"Ask Von Drake\", when he tries to pull the sword from the stone with Arthur, Merlin, and Madam Mim. Madam Mim appears as a villain in the spin-off film ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''. In the past, Merlin frequented the Disney Parks, the only character from the film appearing occasionally for meet-and-greets at [[Disneyland Resort]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. He appeared in the opening unit of [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland Park]]. He also hosts the ''Sword in the Stone'' ceremony in the [[King Arthur Carrousel]] attraction in [[Fantasyland]] at [[Disneyland]]. In 2014 and 2015, UK health directive [[Change4Life]] incorporated \"Higitus Figitus\" as the soundtrack to adverts promoting their Disney-sponsored \"10 minute shake up\" summer program.\n\n=== Comics ===\n[[File:Madam Mim.gif|thumb|Madam Mim]]\n\nMadam Mim was adopted into the Duck franchise where she sometimes teams with [[Magica De Spell]] and/or the [[Beagle Boys]]. She also appeared in the Mickey Mouse franchise where she teamed with [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] on occasion and with the [[Phantom Blot]] at one point. She was in love with [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] in several stories; in others, with [[Phantom Blot]]. In many European Disney comics, she lost her truly evil streak, and appears morbid yet relatively polite.\n\nMim has appeared in numerous comics produced in the United States by Studio Program in the 1960s and 1970s,<ref>First is in S 65051, according to the [[Inducks]]</ref> often as a sidekick of Magica. Most of the stories were published in Europe and South America. Among the artists are Jim Fletcher, [[Tony Strobl]], Wolfgang Sch\u00e4fer, and Katja Sch\u00e4fer. Several new characters were introduced in these stories, including Samson Hex, an apprentice of Mim and Magica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Samson+Hex|title=Samson Hex - I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|website=coa.inducks.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\nMadam Mim made a surprise appearance in the video game ''[[World of Illusion]]'' as the fourth boss of that game.\n\nMerlin is a supporting character in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, now voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts|developer=Square|publisher=Square Electronic Arts|date=November 15, 2002|platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=Square|publisher=Square Electronic Arts|date=December 22, 2005|platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref> In ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', Merlin lives in an abandoned shack in Traverse Town with [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]'s [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]], sent by [[Mickey Mouse|King Mickey]] to aid Sora, Donald, and Goofy in the art of magic. He owns an old book which features the world of The Hundred Acre Wood, home of Winnie the Pooh. The book's pages, however, have been torn out and scattered across the universe, and Merlin asks Sora to retrieve them for him. He reprises the same role in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', as a figment of Sora's memories. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Merlin moved to Hollow Bastion to aid Leon's group as part of the town Restoration Committee, though he is at odds with Cid who prefers his own computer expertise rather than Merlin's magic. Merlin again instructs Sora, Donald and Goofy in the art of magic, and again requests that they retrieve the stolen parts of the Pooh storybook. At one point in the game, he is summoned to Disney Castle by [[Minnie Mouse|Queen Minnie]] to counter the threat of [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], and he constructs a door leading to Disney Castle's past (Timeless River) for the trio to explore and stop Maleficent and Pete's plans. In the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', Merlin encounters Terra, Aqua and Ventus, and grants them each access to the Hundred Acre Wood. The prequel also reveals that it was Terra who gave him the book in the first place after finding it in Radiant Garden. According to series creator [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a world based on the film was initially to appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', but the idea was scrapped. Merlin returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', where he asks Sora to restore Pooh's storybook once more (though it does not involve finding any missing pages), but his involvement in the story is minimal beyond that as he spends his time at Remy's bistro in Twilight Town having tea.\n\n===Live-action film adaptation===\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action feature film adaptation]] entered development in July 2015, with [[Bryan Cogman]] and [[Brigham Taylor]] serving as screenwriter and producer respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-live-action-remake-809845|title='Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake in the Works With 'Game of Thrones' Writer (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=July 20, 2015|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Disney|Cartoon|Film|United States|1960s}}\n* [[List of films based on Arthurian legend]]\n* [[List of American films of 1963]]\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote|The Sword in the Stone (film)}}\n{{Commons}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{AllMovie title|48212|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{IMDb title|0057546|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{tcmdb title|25090|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|sword_in_the_stone|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{Mojo title|swordinthestone83|The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n{{Wolfgang Reitherman}}\n{{Sherman Brothers Musical Films}}\n{{The Once and Future King}}\n{{Films based on Arthurian legends}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sword in the Stone, The}}\n[[Category:1963 animated films]]\n[[Category:1963 films]]\n[[Category:1960s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1960s coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:1960s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American sword and sorcery films]]\n[[Category:Animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated musical films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Animated films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on novels]]\n[[Category:Arthurian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about royalty]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films about witchcraft]]\n[[Category:Films about wizards]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wolfgang Reitherman]]\n[[Category:Films featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walt Disney]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 5th century]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Bruns]]\n[[Category:Merlin]]\n[[Category:Musicals by the Sherman Brothers]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1963 American animated fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Sword in the Stone\n| image          = SwordintheStonePoster.JPG\n| caption        = Original theatrical release poster\n| alt            = <!-- See WP:ALT -->\n| director       = [[Wolfgang Reitherman]]\n| producer       = [[Walt Disney]]\n| story          = [[Bill Peet]]\n| based on       = {{based on|''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]''|[[T.

The 18th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on the [[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|novel of the same name]], which was first published in 1938 as a single novel. It was later republished in 1958 as the first book of [[T. H. White]]'s [[tetralogy]] ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. With story written by [[Bill Peet]] and directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the film features the voices of [[Rickie Sorensen]], [[Karl Swenson]], [[Junius Matthews]], [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]], [[Norman Alden]], and [[Martha Wentworth]].\n\nWalt Disney first acquired the film rights to the novel in 1939, and various attempts at developing the film would last two decades before actual production on the film officially began. ''The Sword in the Stone'' would be the last animated film from Walt Disney Productions to be produced by Walt Disney before his death on December 15, 1966. The songs in the film were written and composed by the [[Sherman Brothers]], who later wrote music for other Disney films like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.\n\n''The Sword in the Stone'' was released to theaters on December 25, 1963 to mixed reviews, though it was a box office success. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1983 as a double feature with ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]''.\n\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action remake]] of the film directed by [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] entered development in 2015, and will be released on [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Disney's 'Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake Finds Director (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-remake-disney-hires-director-1075997|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 19, 2018|access-date=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 533 words. -->\nAfter the [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], [[Uther Pendragon]], dies, leaving no [[heir]] to the throne, a [[Excalibur|sword]] appears inside an anvil in London, with an inscription proclaiming that whoever removes it is the rightful King of England. None succeed in removing the sword, which becomes forgotten, leaving England in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].\n\nYears later, a 12-year-old orphan named Arthur, commonly called Wart, accidentally scares off a deer his older foster brother [[Sir Kay|Kay]] was hunting, causing Kay to launch his arrow into the forest. In attempting to retrieve the arrow, Arthur meets [[Merlin]], an elderly [[magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who lives with his talking pet owl Archimedes. Merlin declares himself Arthur's tutor and returns with him to his home, a castle run by [[Sir Ector]], Arthur's foster father. Ector's friend, [[Pellinore|Sir Pellinore]], arrives to announce that the annual [[jousting]] tournament will be held in London, and the winner will be crowned king. Ector decides to put Kay through serious training for the tournament and appoints Arthur as Kay's [[squire]].\n\nIn order to educate Arthur, Merlin transforms the boy and himself into [[fish]]. They swim in the castle moat in order to learn about [[reaction (physics)|physics]]. After the lesson, Arthur is sent to the kitchen as punishment for attempting to relate his lesson to a disbelieving Ector. Merlin enchants the dishes to wash themselves, then takes Arthur for another lesson, turning them into [[tree squirrel]]s to learn about [[gravity]]. After they return to human form, Ector accuses Merlin of using [[black magic]] on the dishes. Arthur defiantly defends Merlin, but Ector refuses to listen and punishes Arthur by giving Kay another squire, Hobbs. Resolving to make amends, Merlin plans on educating Arthur full-time. However, Merlin's knowledge of future history confuses Arthur, prompting Merlin to appoint Archimedes as Arthur's teacher. Merlin transforms Arthur into a [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]] and Archimedes teaches him how to [[flight|fly]]. Soon after, Arthur encounters Madam Mim, an eccentric, evil witch who is Merlin's nemesis. Merlin arrives to rescue Arthur, and Mim challenges Merlin to a Wizards' Duel. Despite Mim's cheating, Merlin outsmarts her by transforming into a [[microorganism|germ]] that infects Mim, thus illustrating the importance of knowledge over strength. On [[Christmas Eve]], Kay is knighted, but Hobbs comes down with the [[mumps]]; therefore, Ector reinstates Arthur as Kay's squire. This causes Merlin to think that Arthur cares more about war games than having an education, and when Arthur defends his choices, Merlin angrily transports himself in time to [[20th century]] [[Bermuda]].\n\nOn the day of the tournament, Arthur realizes that he has left Kay's sword at an [[inn]], which is now closed for the tournament. Archimedes sees the legendary \"Sword in the Stone\" in a nearby churchyard, which Arthur removes almost effortlessly, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy. When Arthur returns with the sword, Ector recognizes it and the tournament is halted. Ector places the sword back in its anvil, demanding Arthur prove that he pulled it. He pulls it once again, revealing that he is England's rightful king. Later, the newly crowned king Arthur sits in the throne room with Archimedes, feeling unprepared for the responsibility of ruling, but Merlin returns from Bermuda and resolves to help Arthur become the great king that he has foreseen him to be.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Do not add links to pages that have not been written yet, per [[WP:REDNOT]].

Sir Kay was also seen in the episode: \"Ask Von Drake\", when he tries to pull the sword from the stone with Arthur, Merlin, and Madam Mim. Madam Mim appears as a villain in the spin-off film ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''. In the past, Merlin frequented the Disney Parks, the only character from the film appearing occasionally for meet-and-greets at [[Disneyland Resort]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. He appeared in the opening unit of [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland Park]]. He also hosts the ''Sword in the Stone'' ceremony in the [[King Arthur Carrousel]] attraction in [[Fantasyland]] at [[Disneyland]]. In 2014 and 2015, UK health directive [[Change4Life]] incorporated \"Higitus Figitus\" as the soundtrack to adverts promoting their Disney-sponsored \"10 minute shake up\" summer program.\n\n=== Comics ===\n[[File:Madam Mim.gif|thumb|Madam Mim]]\n\nMadam Mim was adopted into the Duck franchise where she sometimes teams with [[Magica De Spell]] and/or the [[Beagle Boys]].

He owns an old book which features the world of The Hundred Acre Wood, home of Winnie the Pooh. The book's pages, however, have been torn out and scattered across the universe, and Merlin asks Sora to retrieve them for him. He reprises the same role in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', as a figment of Sora's memories. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Merlin moved to Hollow Bastion to aid Leon's group as part of the town Restoration Committee, though he is at odds with Cid who prefers his own computer expertise rather than Merlin's magic. Merlin again instructs Sora, Donald and Goofy in the art of magic, and again requests that they retrieve the stolen parts of the Pooh storybook. At one point in the game, he is summoned to Disney Castle by [[Minnie Mouse|Queen Minnie]] to counter the threat of [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], and he constructs a door leading to Disney Castle's past (Timeless River) for the trio to explore and stop Maleficent and Pete's plans. In the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', Merlin encounters Terra, Aqua and Ventus, and grants them each access to the Hundred Acre Wood. The prequel also reveals that it was Terra who gave him the book in the first place after finding it in Radiant Garden. According to series creator [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a world based on the film was initially to appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', but the idea was scrapped. Merlin returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', where he asks Sora to restore Pooh's storybook once more (though it does not involve finding any missing pages), but his involvement in the story is minimal beyond that as he spends his time at Remy's bistro in Twilight Town having tea.\n\n===Live-action film adaptation===\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action feature film adaptation]] entered development in July 2015, with [[Bryan Cogman]] and [[Brigham Taylor]] serving as screenwriter and producer respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-live-action-remake-809845|title='Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake in the Works With 'Game of Thrones' Writer (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=July 20, 2015|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Disney|Cartoon|Film|United States|1960s}}\n* [[List of films based on Arthurian legend]]\n* [[List of American films of 1963]]\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote|The Sword in the Stone (film)}}\n{{Commons}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{AllMovie title|48212|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{IMDb title|0057546|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{tcmdb title|25090|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|sword_in_the_stone|The Sword in the Stone}}\n* {{Mojo title|swordinthestone83|The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n{{Wolfgang Reitherman}}\n{{Sherman Brothers Musical Films}}\n{{The Once and Future King}}\n{{Films based on Arthurian legends}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sword in the Stone, The}}\n[[Category:1963 animated films]]\n[[Category:1963 films]]\n[[Category:1960s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1960s coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:1960s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American sword and sorcery films]]\n[[Category:Animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated musical films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Animated films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on novels]]\n[[Category:Arthurian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about royalty]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films about witchcraft]]\n[[Category:Films about wizards]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wolfgang Reitherman]]\n[[Category:Films featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walt Disney]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 5th century]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Bruns]]\n[[Category:Merlin]]\n[[Category:Musicals by the Sherman Brothers]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n", "name_user": "Binabik80", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_(1963_film)"}

She will go to [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1354 and ask king [[Louis I of Hungary]] for confirmation of Tvrtko's rule in Bosnia. She held [[stanak]] (assembly of nobility) in Mile, Visoko, asking nobleman's to confirm all rights of Tvrtko, who was 15 years old by that time. [[Old town of Visoki]] on [[Viso\u010dica hill]] is first mentioned in charted that was issued on 1 September 1355, where Tvrtko I granted [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusians]] all benefits and freedom in trade, that was customary from the time of Kulin (see [[Charter of Ban Kulin]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=http://old.kons.gov.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&lang=1&action=view&id=2409 |title=Komisija za o\u010duvanje nacionalnih spomenika |website=old.kons.gov.ba |access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> [[Podvisoki]] is mentioned in 1363, but its glory days will come when Bosnia becomes [[Realm|kingdom]].\n\n=== Bosnian kingdom ===\nThe [[coronation]] of [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]]  was held on 26 October 1377 in the [[Mile (Visoko)|Church of St. Nicholaus, Mile]]. The Bosnian banate was now kingdom. Evidence that this happened in Visoko was proven [[Archaeology|archaeologically]]{{sfn|An\u0111eli\u0107|1979|p=}} Tvrtko Kotromani\u0107 wrote to [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]] on 12 March 1380, and location of issuing was [[royal court]] of Mo\u0161tre (Moi\u0161tri in medieval sources), that is located in Visoko basin.\n\n==== Political and trading center of Bosnia ====\nThe [[Trade|trading]] center of the Bosnian kingdom was [[Podvisoki]], which had a considerable colony of Ragusian merchants. From 1404 to 1428, Podvisoki is frequent caravan destination. Mila\u0161 Radomiri\u0107 was a prominent merchant from Visoko, later accepted as a [[Republic of Ragusa]] citizen. On April 9, 1428, wedding engagement was made between [[Tvrtko II]] and [[Dorothy Garai]], and by July 31 Ragusian asked for the queen to stop by Podvisoki so she could receive gifts. The biggest caravan shipment was recorded in 1428. On August 9, [[Vlachs]] committed to Ragusan lord Tomo Buni\u0107, that they will with 600 horses deliver 1500 [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Dry measure|modius]] of [[salt]]. Mile was one of the places where Bosnian nobility and kings held [[stanak]].<ref>Mustafa Imamovi\u0107, Osnove upravno-politi\u010dkog razvitka i dr\u017eavnopravnog polo\u017eaja Bosne i Hercegovine, Pravni fakultet Univerziteta u Sarajevu, Sarajevo (2006), str. 46.</ref>\n\n==== Struggle for power ====\n[[Ostoja of Bosnia]] was one of the most active kings that left trace in Visoko. He assumed his role as a king in 1398, but after 4 years he was forced to flee Bosnia. [[Nobility]] with Tvrtko II held a meeting in Mile and they decided to overthrow Ostoja because of his pro-Hungarian stance. Ostoja has lost support of almost all nobility at the time. Stanak that was held in June 5, 1404 was difficult and very long.{{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=29}} Hungarians decided to send an army into Bosnia, and Podvisoki will be [[looted]] on Mart 4, 1410. They even captured some Ragusians merchants stationed in Podvisoki, for which Republic of Ragusa protested to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund,]] King of Hungary {{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=33}} In 1412 Vuk Kotromani\u0107, [[Niece and nephew|nephew]] of king Ostoja killed and stole silver from one Ragusian merchant Jak\u0161a Buni\u0107. Ragusians demanded that Vuk be punished for his crime, but there is no evidence that he was ever prosecuted. However, king Ostoja remained in power, and Tvrtko II went into hiding.[[File:Coin_of_Tvrtko_II.jpg|left|thumb|330x330px|Money of king [[Tvrtko II of Bosnia|Tvrtko II]]. He was chosen as new king in 1404 at meeting in [[Mile (Visoko)|Mile]], [[Visoko]]]]\nKing Ostoja would die in 1418, and that will spark another unrest in the kingdom, that will grow into a [[civil war]]. Nobility once again didn't approve of a new king, son of Ostoja, [[Stephen Ostoji\u0107 of Bosnia|Stjepan Ostoji\u0107]]. He only had a handful of nobility behind him, namely Petar Pavlovi\u0107 and Radosav Vladimiri\u0107. Stjepan Ostoji\u0107 ruled until June 5, 1420, when a meeting of nobility in Visoko sealed his fate. Crucial event for Ostoji\u0107's demise would be conciliation between [[Pavlovi\u0107 noble family|Radosav Pavlovi\u0107]] and Duke [[Sandalj Hrani\u0107]].\n\nTvrtko II appeared around this time, and he will have the support of Bosnian nobility in Visoko, that included [[Zlatonosovi\u0107 noble family|voivod Vukmir]], mayor Dragi\u0161a, [[Knyaz|knez]] Juraj Vojsali\u0107, knez Pribi\u0107, knez Radi\u010d Radojevi\u0107, knez Bati\u0107 Mirkovi\u0107, knez Juraj Dragi\u010devi\u0107, knez Petar Kle\u0161i\u0107, [[Voivode|voivod]] Ivko, and voivod Pavao Jurjevi\u0107. Earlier that year that same nobility had supported Ostoji\u0107 in one meeting that was held at the start of 1420, but Tvrtko II this time was assisted by [[Ottoman Empire]] in reclaiming his throne and made Visoko his [[royal court]] in 1421.{{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=37}}\n\nVisoko held a meeting with [[Republic of Venice]] representatives, as they were granted the freedoms in trade in a charter issued on December 21, 1422 in Visoko. [[Ishak Bey]] will retreat with his forces and Tvrtko would become undisputed king. By 1432 a new [[pretender]] to the throne will emerge, this time [[Radivoj of Bosnia|Radivoj Ostoji\u0107]], illegitimate son of king Ostoja. Tvrtko II by this time have lost a lot of support of Bosnian nobility, and once again Hungarians will enter the scene, but this time they will support Tvrtko II and reestablish him as the king. Visoko from this time stagnated and began to lose its importance. Ottoman Empire was becoming a real threat to Bosnian Kingdom, and Visoko valley will be soon on the Ottoman frontier.\n\n=== Fall of the Kingdom ===\nOttoman Empire by 1451 had a stronghold in [[Vrhbosna]] (today's [[Sarajevo]]) and Visoko was not safe for kings. Economic activity in Podvisoki faded, and kings and nobility have gone to the west and north parts of the kingdom that were better fortified, like [[Bobovac]] and Klju\u010d.{{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=50}}\n\nIn this twilight years of Bosnian kingdom, [[Thomas of Bosnia]] began banishing member of the [[Bosnian Church]] that was considered heretic by [[Catholic Church]], as a means to ensure help from west from ever growing threat from Ottoman Empire. It seemed to work, as for the first time crown for a king in Bosnia would come from Rome itself, and crowning was scheduled to take place in Visoko. Banishment of Bosnian Church followers who always had a stronghold in Visoko area was the reason why in 1450, followers of Bosnian Church demolished [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]] in Visoko.<ref name=\"Sarajevu\">{{Cite journal |last=Sarajevu |first=Institut za historiju-Univerzitet u |title=Pejo \u0106o\u0161kovi\u0107 - Crkva bosanska u XV. stolje\u0107u. |url=https://www.academia.edu/31560898 |language=en}}</ref> It was rebuilt shortly after by some Mihovil Ostoji\u0107 (Ostoides).<ref name=\"Sarajevu\" /> By 1462 Visoko was center of Ottoman territorial area, known as [[Nahiye (Ottoman)|Visoko nahiye]].

The first mention of the town happened on 1 September 1355, but it is believed to have been built even earlier. It was used by Bosnian bans and kings as a ruler's residence from which several official charters were written to other states. It was also defensively fortified, as the fortress had a [[trench]] and many [[tower]]s of varying sizes. Visoki was first mentioned in a charter written in the royal town of Visoki, and was named ''in castro nosto Visoka vocatum''. The charter was written by a young ban, [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]], who later became king in 1377 by his coronation in [[Mile (medieval location)|Mile]]. Several other rulers and nobles wrote charters in Visoki, including King [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia]] and Tvrtko Borovini\u0107, who would be the last to write of the old town of Visoki in 1436 in the document ''on Visoki''. \nVisoki was built on [[Viso\u010dica hill]], at a height of 766 meters, and 300 meters above the valley where the modern town of [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]] is located. By the time of the [[Ottoman empire|Turkish conquest]] of Bosnia, the old town was probably destroyed and never reconstructed. Few remnants of old Visoki remain, most being preserved in the town's museum. ''In situ'' evidence include the remains of foundations of the towers, walls and gates of Visoki. A model has been reconstructed according to plans of \u0110oko Mazali\u0107 made in 1953. The old royal town of Visoki is a national monument of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Today, beginning from 2007 its ruins are being slowly excavated so the town is becoming visible more and more. \n[[Image:MileOstaci.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Remains of old church in Mile]]\n\n=== Podvisoki ===\n{{Main|Podvisoki}}\nPodvisoki is a modern settlement in Visoko and was once a medieval subtown of the royal town. It was an important [[trade]] center and sometimes a ruler's residence. Podvisoki was one of the earliest examples of the medieval [[urban area|urban]] environments in Bosnia. In Podvisoki, a colony of Dubrovnik's merchants developed and maintained historically good relations with the [[Republic of Ragusa]]. The terms Bosnia and Podvisoki are often mentioned in Ragusan charters and documents. Biggest caravan shipment in medieval Bosnia happened in 1428 between Podvisoki and Dubrovnik. Often, term Bosnia would be identified with Podvisoki, which was one of the most important trade centres in country and located in the core of Bosnian state.\n\n=== Mile ===\n{{Main|Mile (Visoko)}}\n\nMile was first recorded in 1244 as the home of the Church of [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]], a possession of the Bosnian bishopric. Around 1340, a [[Franciscan]] vicarage was established in Mile, the Franciscan monastery in the town was the first in Bosnia. The monastery is located by the modern settlement of Arnautovi\u0107i on the right bank of the [[river Bosna]]. Mile was the coronation and burial place of Bosnian bans and kings during the medieval Bosnian state and was also the site where the [[Rusag]] was held. The first king of Bosnia, [[Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]], was crowned in Mile in [[Franciscan]] church St. Nikola, and later buried there alongside his uncle [[Stjepan II Kotromani\u0107]]. An archive with important documents was also located in Mile.\n\nVisoko's museum houses many artifacts founded by archaeological excavations in the valley. One such expedition found a [[necropolis]] of ''ste\u0107ak'', some made in fine detail, including many materials, jewellery, tools, and other artifacts.\n\n=== Mo\u0161tre ===\n[[File:TvrtkoPoveljaMo\u0161tre.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Charter of King Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107, written in Mo\u0161tre]]\n[[File:Plo\u010da Kulina bana.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Kulin Ban's plate from 1193, found in Biskupi\u0107i]]\nThere is not much detailed information about the [[medieval university]] in the Visoko area, referred to as the ''place called Bosnia'' by the [[Vatican archives]]. The university at Mo\u0161tre was first mentioned in 1175 as a high academy of Bosnian religious organization (see [[Bosnian Church]]). The university was known for its scholarship in [[medicine]], [[theology]], [[cosmogony]], and [[ethics]]. There are four documents that directly or indirectly point to the existence of the high academy in the Visoko Area.\n\nIn addition to its university, Mo\u0161tre was the location of [[Bosnian church]] institutions including the ''house of krstjani''. Also, Mo\u0161tre was a place where charters were sometimes written; for example, in 1323, when ban Stjepan published his charter to Duke Vukoslav, and later in 1381, when king [[Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]] issued a charter to [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107]].\n\n=== Other locations ===\nIn Biskupi\u0107i, a plate of [[Kulin Ban]] dating from 1193 was found alongside remains of his church, grave, and foundations of buildings from that period. Other notable medieval settlements in the vicinity included Sebinje town, \u010cajan town in Gra\u010danica\u2014which protected the roads between Visoko and [[Bobovac]]\u2014and the town of Bedem i Godu\u0161a.\n \nIn small settlement of Malo \u010cajno on today's [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ortodox church]] cemetery, a plate of Big [[Kaznac]] Nespina was found. The stone slab represents the relief scene of hunting in Romanesque stylistic characteristics. Its length is 210&nbsp;cm, height 106&nbsp;cm, and thickness is 7\u201310&nbsp;cm.

She will go to [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1354 and ask king [[Louis I of Hungary]] for confirmation of Tvrtko's rule in Bosnia. She held [[stanak]] (assembly of nobility) in Mile, Visoko, asking nobleman's to confirm all rights of Tvrtko, who was 15 years old by that time. [[Old town of Visoki]] on [[Viso\u010dica hill]] is first mentioned in charted that was issued on 1 September 1355, where Tvrtko I granted [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusians]] all benefits and freedom in trade, that was customary from the time of Kulin (see [[Charter of Ban Kulin]]).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=http://old.kons.gov.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&lang=1&action=view&id=2409 |title=Komisija za o\u010duvanje nacionalnih spomenika |website=old.kons.gov.ba |access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> [[Podvisoki]] is mentioned in 1363, but its glory days will come when Bosnia becomes [[Realm|kingdom]].\n\n=== Bosnian kingdom ===\nThe crowning of [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]]  was held on 26 October 1377 in the [[Mile (Visoko)|Church of St. Nicholaus, Mile]]. The Bosnian banate was now kingdom. Evidence that this happened in Visoko was proven [[Archaeology|archaeologically]]{{sfn|An\u0111eli\u0107|1979|p=}} Tvrtko Kotromani\u0107 wrote to [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]] on 12 March 1380, and location of issuing was [[royal court]] of Mo\u0161tre (Moi\u0161tri in medieval sources), that is located in Visoko basin.\n\n==== Political and trading center of Bosnia ====\nThe [[Trade|trading]] center of the Bosnian kingdom was [[Podvisoki]], which had a considerable colony of Ragusian merchants. From 1404 to 1428, Podvisoki is frequent caravan destination. Mila\u0161 Radomiri\u0107 was a prominent merchant from Visoko, later accepted as a [[Republic of Ragusa]] citizen. On April 9, 1428, wedding engagement was made between [[Tvrtko II]] and [[Dorothy Garai]], and by July 31 Ragusian asked for the queen to stop by Podvisoki so she could receive gifts. The biggest caravan shipment was recorded in 1428. On August 9, [[Vlachs]] committed to Ragusan lord Tomo Buni\u0107, that they will with 600 horses deliver 1500 [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Dry measure|modius]] of [[salt]]. Mile was one of the places where Bosnian nobility and kings held [[stanak]].<ref>Mustafa Imamovi\u0107, Osnove upravno-politi\u010dkog razvitka i dr\u017eavnopravnog polo\u017eaja Bosne i Hercegovine, Pravni fakultet Univerziteta u Sarajevu, Sarajevo (2006), str. 46.</ref>\n\n==== Struggle for power ====\n[[Ostoja of Bosnia]] was one of the most active kings that left trace in Visoko. He assumed his role as a king in 1398, but after 4 years he was forced to flee Bosnia. [[Nobility]] with Tvrtko II held a meeting in Mile and they decided to overthrow Ostoja because of his pro-Hungarian stance. Ostoja has lost support of almost all nobility at the time. Stanak that was held in June 5, 1404 was difficult and very long.{{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=29}} Hungarians decided to send an army into Bosnia, and Podvisoki will be [[looted]] on Mart 4, 1410. They even captured some Ragusians merchants stationed in Podvisoki, for which Republic of Ragusa protested to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund,]] King of Hungary {{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=33}} In 1412 Vuk Kotromani\u0107, [[Niece and nephew|nephew]] of king Ostoja killed and stole silver from one Ragusian merchant Jak\u0161a Buni\u0107. Ragusians demanded that Vuk be punished for his crime, but there is no evidence that he was ever prosecuted. However, king Ostoja remained in power, and Tvrtko II went into hiding.[[File:Coin_of_Tvrtko_II.jpg|left|thumb|330x330px|Money of king [[Tvrtko II of Bosnia|Tvrtko II]]. He was chosen as new king in 1404 at meeting in [[Mile (Visoko)|Mile]], [[Visoko]]]]\nKing Ostoja would die in 1418, and that will spark another unrest in the kingdom, that will grow into a [[civil war]]. Nobility once again didn't approve of a new king, son of Ostoja, [[Stephen Ostoji\u0107 of Bosnia|Stjepan Ostoji\u0107]]. He only had a handful of nobility behind him, namely Petar Pavlovi\u0107 and Radosav Vladimiri\u0107. Stjepan Ostoji\u0107 ruled until June 5, 1420, when a meeting of nobility in Visoko sealed his fate. Crucial event for Ostoji\u0107's demise would be conciliation between [[Pavlovi\u0107 noble family|Radosav Pavlovi\u0107]] and Duke [[Sandalj Hrani\u0107]].\n\nTvrtko II appeared around this time, and he will have the support of Bosnian nobility in Visoko, that included [[Zlatonosovi\u0107 noble family|voivod Vukmir]], mayor Dragi\u0161a, [[Knyaz|knez]] Juraj Vojsali\u0107, knez Pribi\u0107, knez Radi\u010d Radojevi\u0107, knez Bati\u0107 Mirkovi\u0107, knez Juraj Dragi\u010devi\u0107, knez Petar Kle\u0161i\u0107, [[Voivode|voivod]] Ivko, and voivod Pavao Jurjevi\u0107. Earlier that year that same nobility had supported Ostoji\u0107 in one meeting that was held at the start of 1420, but Tvrtko II this time was assisted by [[Ottoman Empire]] in reclaiming his throne and made Visoko his [[royal court]] in 1421.{{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=37}}\n\nVisoko held a meeting with [[Republic of Venice]] representatives, as they were granted the freedoms in trade in a charter issued on December 21, 1422 in Visoko. [[Ishak Bey]] will retreat with his forces and Tvrtko would become undisputed king. By 1432 a new [[pretender]] to the throne will emerge, this time [[Radivoj of Bosnia|Radivoj Ostoji\u0107]], illegitimate son of king Ostoja. Tvrtko II by this time have lost a lot of support of Bosnian nobility, and once again Hungarians will enter the scene, but this time they will support Tvrtko II and reestablish him as the king. Visoko from this time stagnated and began to lose its importance. Ottoman Empire was becoming a real threat to Bosnian Kingdom, and Visoko valley will be soon on the Ottoman frontier. \n=== Fall of the Kingdom ===\nOttoman Empire by 1451 had a stronghold in [[Vrhbosna]] (today's [[Sarajevo]]) and Visoko was not safe for kings. Economic activity in Podvisoki faded, and kings and nobility have gone to the west and north parts of the kingdom that were better fortified, like [[Bobovac]] and Klju\u010d.{{sfn|Jeleni\u0107|1906|p=50}}\n\nIn this twilight years of Bosnian kingdom, [[Thomas of Bosnia]] began banishing member of the [[Bosnian Church]] that was considered heretic by [[Catholic Church]], as a means to ensure help from west from ever growing threat from Ottoman Empire. It seemed to work, as for the first time crown for a king in Bosnia would come from Rome itself, and crowning was scheduled to take place in Visoko. Banishment of Bosnian Church followers who always had a stronghold in Visoko area was the reason why in 1450, followers of Bosnian Church demolished [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]] in Visoko.<ref name=\"Sarajevu\">{{Cite journal |last=Sarajevu |first=Institut za historiju-Univerzitet u |title=Pejo \u0106o\u0161kovi\u0107 - Crkva bosanska u XV. stolje\u0107u. |url=https://www.academia.edu/31560898 |language=en}}</ref> It was rebuilt shortly after by some Mihovil Ostoji\u0107 (Ostoides).<ref name=\"Sarajevu\" /> By 1462 Visoko was center of Ottoman territorial area, known as [[Nahiye (Ottoman)|Visoko nahiye]].

The first mention of the town happened on 1 September 1355, but it is believed to have been built even earlier. It was used by Bosnian bans and kings as a ruler's residence from which several official charters were written to other states. It was also defensively fortified, as the fortress had a [[trench]] and many [[tower]]s of varying sizes. Visoki was first mentioned in a charter written in the royal town of Visoki, and was named ''in castro nosto Visoka vocatum''. The charter was written by a young ban, [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]], who later became king in 1377 by his coronation in [[Mile (medieval location)|Mile]]. Several other rulers and nobles wrote charters in Visoki, including King [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia]] and Tvrtko Borovini\u0107, who would be the last to write of the old town of Visoki in 1436 in the document ''on Visoki''. \nVisoki was built on [[Viso\u010dica hill]], at a height of 766 meters, and 300 meters above the valley where the modern town of [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]] is located. By the time of the [[Ottoman empire|Turkish conquest]] of Bosnia, the old town was probably destroyed and never reconstructed. Few remnants of old Visoki remain, most being preserved in the town's museum. ''In situ'' evidence include the remains of foundations of the towers, walls and gates of Visoki. A model has been reconstructed according to plans of \u0110oko Mazali\u0107 made in 1953. The old royal town of Visoki is a national monument of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Today, beginning from 2007 its ruins are being slowly excavated so the town is becoming visible more and more. \n[[Image:MileOstaci.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Remains of old church in Mile]]\n\n=== Podvisoki ===\n{{Main|Podvisoki}}\nPodvisoki is a modern settlement in Visoko and was once a medieval subtown of the royal town. It was an important [[trade]] center and sometimes a ruler's residence. Podvisoki was one of the earliest examples of the medieval [[urban area|urban]] environments in Bosnia. In Podvisoki, a colony of Dubrovnik's merchants developed and maintained historically good relations with the [[Republic of Ragusa]]. The terms Bosnia and Podvisoki are often mentioned in Ragusan charters and documents. Biggest caravan shipment in medieval Bosnia happened in 1428 between Podvisoki and Dubrovnik. Often, term Bosnia would be identified with Podvisoki, which was one of the most important trade centres in country and located in the core of Bosnian state.\n\n=== Mile ===\n{{Main|Mile (Visoko)}}\n\nMile was first recorded in 1244 as the home of the Church of [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]], a possession of the Bosnian bishopric. Around 1340, a [[Franciscan]] vicarage was established in Mile, the Franciscan monastery in the town was the first in Bosnia. The monastery is located by the modern settlement of Arnautovi\u0107i on the right bank of the [[river Bosna]]. Mile was the coronation and burial place of Bosnian bans and kings during the medieval Bosnian state and was also the site where the [[Rusag]] was held. The first king of Bosnia, [[Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]], was crowned in Mile in [[Franciscan]] church St. Nikola, and later buried there alongside his uncle [[Stjepan II Kotromani\u0107]]. An archive with important documents was also located in Mile.\n\nVisoko's museum houses many artifacts founded by archaeological excavations in the valley. One such expedition found a [[necropolis]] of ''ste\u0107ak'', some made in fine detail, including many materials, jewellery, tools, and other artifacts.\n\n=== Mo\u0161tre ===\n[[File:TvrtkoPoveljaMo\u0161tre.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Charter of King Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107, written in Mo\u0161tre]]\n[[File:Plo\u010da Kulina bana.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|Kulin Ban's plate from 1193, found in Biskupi\u0107i]]\nThere is not much detailed information about the [[medieval university]] in the Visoko area, referred to as the ''place called Bosnia'' by the [[Vatican archives]]. The university at Mo\u0161tre was first mentioned in 1175 as a high academy of Bosnian religious organization (see [[Bosnian Church]]). The university was known for its scholarship in [[medicine]], [[theology]], [[cosmogony]], and [[ethics]]. There are four documents that directly or indirectly point to the existence of the high academy in the Visoko Area.\n\nIn addition to its university, Mo\u0161tre was the location of [[Bosnian church]] institutions including the ''house of krstjani''. Also, Mo\u0161tre was a place where charters were sometimes written; for example, in 1323, when ban Stjepan published his charter to Duke Vukoslav, and later in 1381, when king [[Tvrtko I Kotromani\u0107]] issued a charter to [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107]].\n\n=== Other locations ===\nIn Biskupi\u0107i, a plate of [[Kulin Ban]] dating from 1193 was found alongside remains of his church, grave, and foundations of buildings from that period. Other notable medieval settlements in the vicinity included Sebinje town, \u010cajan town in Gra\u010danica\u2014which protected the roads between Visoko and [[Bobovac]]\u2014and the town of Bedem i Godu\u0161a.\n \nIn small settlement of Malo \u010cajno on today's [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ortodox church]] cemetery, a plate of Big [[Kaznac]] Nespina was found.

Still, according to the same principle mother and children should have been free, because Molly Horniblow, Delilah's mother, had been freed by her white father, who also was her owner. But she had been kidnapped, and had no chance for legal protection because of her dark skin. Harriet and John's father was named Elijah Knox.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She and her brother John also used that name after having escaped from slavery. The baptism was conducted without the knowledge of Harriet's master, Dr. Norcom.

She willed Harriet to her three-year old niece Mary Matilda Norcom.<ref>Three months before she died in 1825, Jacobs' mistress Margaret Horniblow had signed a will leaving her slaves to her mother.

However, the trader was secretly in league with Sawyer, to whom he sold all three of them, thus frustrating Norcom's plan on revenge.

After Sawyer married in 1838, Jacobs asked her grandmother to remind him of his promise.

New York 2004, p.&nbsp;146.</ref>\n\n=== Escape and freedom ===\nIn 1842, Jacobs finally got a chance to escape by boat to [[Philadelphia]], where she was aided by anti-slavery activists of the [[Philadelphia Vigilant Committee]].<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;66.</ref> After a short stay, she continued to [[New York City]]. Although she had no references, Mary Stace Willis, the wife of the then extremely popular author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], accepted to hire Jacobs as the nanny of her baby daughter Imogen. The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;70, 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston-view-1841-Havell.jpeg|251x251px|thumb|left|Boston in 1841]]\nIn 1843 Jacobs heard that Norcom was on his way to New York to force her back into slavery, which was legal for him to do everywhere inside the United States. She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in [[Boston]]. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone [[whaling]] and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph's arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis's nanny.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>\nHer work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, which where the strength of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] guaranteed a certain level of security.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;74.</ref> Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer's cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;68-69, 74.</ref>\n\nIn Boston Jacobs took on odd jobs.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;77-78, 87.</ref> Her stay there was interrupted by the death of Mary Stace Willis in March 1845. Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She didn't notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the USA. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i.&nbsp;e. the anti-slavery movement led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolistionists, among them [[Frederick Douglass]], three years his junior.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the ''Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room'' in [[Rochester, New York]]. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;102-103.</ref>\n\nThe former \u201eslave girl\u201c who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The ''Reading Room'' was in the same building as the newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple [[Amy and Isaac Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rrlc.org/winningthevote/biographies/amy-post/ |title=Amy Post |publisher=Rochester Regional Library Council |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref> Douglass and the Posts were staunch enimies of slavery and racism, and supporters of [[women's suffrage]]. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the world's first convention on women's rights, and had signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which demanded equal rights for women.\n\n==== Obtaining legal freedom ====\n\nIn 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis's second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive \"chattels\", she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013110.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis's) one-year old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other slave mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs's freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that \"a human being [was] ''sold'' in the free city of New York\", happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and \"love\" and \"gratitude\" for Cornelia Willis.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: \"Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;104.</ref>\n\nIn late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs's brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\nStill, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, shared including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.<ref>Transcribed in the appendix to Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself. Cambridge 2000, p.&nbsp;253\u2013255. Summarized in Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\n==== Writing of the manuscript ====\nAt first, Jacobs didn't feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe's answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs's daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe's remark on Louisa with bitter irony: \"what a pity we poor blacks can[']t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.\" In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe's help.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

Written by [[Julia Tyler]], wife of former president [[John Tyler]], the text claimed that the household slaves were \"well clothed and happy\". Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Her letter,<ref>{{citation|title=LETTER FROM A FUGITIVE SLAVE. Slaves Sold under Peculiar Circumstances |date= |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support16.html |access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> signed \"A Fugitive Slave\", published on June 21, was her first text to be printed. Her biographer, [[Jean Fagan Yellin]], comments, \"When the letter was printed ..., an author was born.\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;122-123.</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother's death.<ref>The date of Molly Horniblow's burial in Edenton was September 4, 1853, Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, note to p.124 on p.306.</ref> Yellin concludes that the \"death of her revered grandmother\" made it possible for Jacobs to \"reveal her troubled sexual history\" which she could never have done \"while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;124\u2013126.</ref>\n\nWhile using the little spare time a children's nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today,<ref>\"... when N.P.Willis is mentioned today it is generally as a footnote to some else's story.\"; Baker, Thomas N. Sentiment and Celebrity: Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Yellin comments on the irony of the situation: \"Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer's retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children's nurse who would create an American classic there\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;126.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1857 her work was finally nearing completion and she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: \"as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book \u2013Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it \u2013 that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self\u2013.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;135.</ref>\n\n==== Searching for a publisher ====\n[[File:John Brown. Meeting the slave-mother and her child on the steps of Charlestown jail on his way to execution LCCN2003674588.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Abolitionist drawing of a scene that probably never happened: John Brown meets a slave mother and her child while being led to execution]]\nIn May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn't able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain's prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1859 the anti-slavery activist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] tried to incite a slave rebellion at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]]. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs's second attempt to get her story printed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n==== Lydia Maria Child as the book's editor ====\nJacobs now contacted [[Thayer and Eldridge]], who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown.<ref>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown by James Redpath.</ref> Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she \"resolved to make my last effort\".<ref>Jacobs to Post, October 8, 1860, cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140 and note on p.314.</ref>\n\nJacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested to drop the final chapter on Brown, and to add more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion]]. During this work she kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;140-142.</ref>\n\nAfter the book had been [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;142-143.</ref>\n\nIn January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled ''A True Tale of Slavery'', in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.\n\nIn her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn't mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called \"William\" in his sister's book) mentions Edenton as his birth place and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is \"Dr. Flint\" in Harriet's book, but \"Dr. N-\" in John's. An author's name is not given on the title page, but the \"Preface by the author\" is signed \"Linda Brent\" and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.\n\n==== Reception of the book ====\nThe book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;151-152.</ref>\n\nThe publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda\", thereby conceding her the honorific \"Mrs.\" which normally was reserved for married women.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> The ''[[The Daily News (UK)|London Daily News]]'' wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true \"heroine\", giving an example \"of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty\" and \"moral rectitude\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;152.</ref>\n\n=== Civil War and Reconstruction ===\n==== Relief work and politics ====\n[[File:The Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.jpg|thumb|right|Heroicized painting of the famous assault on [[Fort Wagner]] by the 54th Massachusetts, July 1863.]]\n[[File:Slave pen. Interior view01468v.jpg|thumb|left|Slave pen of an unnamed trader in Alexandria, Virginia. Photograph from the 1860s. Jacobs describes her visit to Birch's (formerly [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield's]]) slave pen in her report ''Life among the Contrabands''.]]\nAfter the [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of president [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in November 1860, the slavery question caused first the secession of most slave states and then the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Thousands of African Americans, having escaped from slavery in the South, gathered just north of the front. Since Lincoln's administration continued to regard them as their masters' property, these refugees were in most cases declared \"contraband of war\" and simply called \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|Contrabands]]\". Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the ''Contrabands'' would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and neighboring [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled ''Life among the Contrabands'', published in September in Garrison's ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. The author was featured as \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of 'Linda'\". This report is a description of the fugitives' misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the [[freedman|freedmen]] will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.<ref>{{citation|title=Life among the Contrabands|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support5.html|access-date=December 22, 2019\n}}. Summary of the report in: Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nDuring the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of ''Incidents'' to build up a network to support her relief work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;161-162.</ref> The ''New York Friends'' (i.e. the [[Quakers]]) gave her credentials as a relief agent.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;164.</ref>\n\nFrom January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker [[Julia Wilbur]], the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]],<ref>For the symbolic and political value of this regiment cf. David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, pp.&nbsp;388\u2013402, especially p.&nbsp;398.</ref> consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: \"How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !\" <ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n==== The Jacobs School ====\n[[File:Jacobs School 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs and their students in front of the Jacobs School, Alexandria, Virginia, 1864]]\nIn most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the ''Jacobs School'' opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda's leadership. In the ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised \"to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters\", to develop \"respect for their race\".<ref>H.Jacobs to L.M.Child, published in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', entitled {{citation|title=Letter from Teachers of the Freedmen|date=April 16, 1864|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support4.html|access-date=December 31, 2019\n}}; cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;177. For the context, pp.&nbsp;176-178.</ref>\n\nJacobs's work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the ''[[Women's Loyal National League]]'', a women's organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which aimed at collecting signatures for a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] to abolish slavery.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;175\u2013176.</ref> On August 1, 1864 she delivered the speech on occasion of the celebration of the [[Emancipation of the British West Indies|British West Indian Emancipation]]<ref>A celebration introduced by the abolitionists in order to demonstrate the backwardness of the US in comparison with the British colonies.</ref> in front of the African American soldiers of a military hospital in Alexandria. Many abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass,<ref>David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, p.&nbsp;418. This is the only time Jacobs is mentioned in this book, while Douglass is mentioned on 30 different pages in Yellin, Harriet Jacobs (according to the index).</ref> stopped over in Alexandria while touring the South in order to see Jacobs and her work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;181\u2013183.</ref> On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;162, cf. p.&nbsp;167.</ref>\n\n==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]], depicting the President disbanding the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].]]\n[[File:Visit of the Ku-Klux 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Terror by the Ku-Klux-Klan, engraving published in [[Harper's Weekly]], February 1872]]\nMother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves,<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;186.</ref> they followed the call of the ''New England Freedmen's Aid Society'' for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They arrived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013194.</ref>\n\nBut the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor [[Andrew Johnson]] was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by the former masters with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs's reports from Georgia.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nAlready in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she untertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the [[Ku-Klux-Klan]] and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the ''New York Friends''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;210-211, 217 and note on p.&nbsp;345.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s a personal tragedy occurred: In the early 1850s, her son Joseph had gone to California to [[California Gold Rush|search for gold]] together with his uncle John. Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;224-225.</ref>\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HarrietJacobsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Harriet Jacobs]]\nAfter her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she kept a [[boarding house]] together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby [[Harvard University]]. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, \"Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord\". (Cf. [[Epistle to the Romans]], 12:11-12)<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013261.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nPrior to [[Jean Fagan Yellin]]'s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as [[John Blassingame]], was that ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' was a fictional novel written by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the [[Amy Post]] papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of ''Incidents,'' and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled ''The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

However, the trader was secretly in league with Sawyer, to whom he sold all three of them, thus frustrating Norcom's plan on revenge.

After Sawyer married in 1838, Jacobs asked her grandmother to remind him of his promise.

New York 2004, p.&nbsp;66.</ref> After a short stay, she continued to [[New York City]]. Although she had no references, Mary Stace Willis, the wife of the then extremely popular author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], accepted to hire Jacobs as the nanny of her baby daughter Imogen. The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in [[Boston]]. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone [[whaling]] and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph's arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis's nanny.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>\nHer work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, which where the strength of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] guaranteed a certain level of security.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;74.</ref> Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer's cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;77-78, 87.</ref> Her stay there was interrupted by the death of Mary Stace Willis in March 1845. Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She didn't notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the USA. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;83\u201387.</ref>\n\n=== The autobiography ===\n''This section is about the genesis of Jacobs's autobiography, seen as part of the story of her life. For the content and an analysis of the autobiography, see the article [[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.\n\n==== Background: Abolitionism and early feminism ====\n\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, journalist, and editor of The Liberator LCCN2017660623 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|William Lloyd Garrison]]\nJohn S. Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i.&nbsp;e. the anti-slavery movement led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolistionists, among them [[Frederick Douglass]], three years his junior.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the ''Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room'' in [[Rochester, New York]]. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;102-103.</ref>\n\nThe former \u201eslave girl\u201c who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The ''Reading Room'' was in the same building as the newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple [[Amy and Isaac Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rrlc.org/winningthevote/biographies/amy-post/ |title=Amy Post |publisher=Rochester Regional Library Council |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref> Douglass and the Posts were staunch enimies of slavery and racism, and supporters of [[women's suffrage]]. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the world's first convention on women's rights, and had signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which demanded equal rights for women.\n\n==== Obtaining legal freedom ====\n\nIn 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis's second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive \"chattels\", she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013110.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis's) one-year old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other slave mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs's freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that \"a human being [was] ''sold'' in the free city of New York\", happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and \"love\" and \"gratitude\" for Cornelia Willis.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: \"Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;104.</ref>\n\nIn late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs's brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\nStill, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, shared including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.<ref>Transcribed in the appendix to Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself.

New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\n==== Writing of the manuscript ====\nAt first, Jacobs didn't feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe's answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs's daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe's remark on Louisa with bitter irony: \"what a pity we poor blacks can[']t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.\" In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe's help.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;119\u2013121; Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself.

Written by [[Julia Tyler]], wife of former president [[John Tyler]], the text claimed that the household slaves were \"well clothed and happy\". Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Her letter,<ref>{{citation|title=LETTER FROM A FUGITIVE SLAVE. Slaves Sold under Peculiar Circumstances |date= |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support16.html |access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> signed \"A Fugitive Slave\", published on June 21, was her first text to be printed. Her biographer, [[Jean Fagan Yellin]], comments, \"When the letter was printed ..., an author was born.\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;122-123.</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother's death.<ref>The date of Molly Horniblow's burial in Edenton was September 4, 1853, Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, note to p.124 on p.306.</ref> Yellin concludes that the \"death of her revered grandmother\" made it possible for Jacobs to \"reveal her troubled sexual history\" which she could never have done \"while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;124\u2013126.</ref>\n\nWhile using the little spare time a children's nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today,<ref>\"... when N.P.Willis is mentioned today it is generally as a footnote to some else's story.\"; Baker, Thomas N. Sentiment and Celebrity: Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Yellin comments on the irony of the situation: \"Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer's retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children's nurse who would create an American classic there\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;126.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1857 her work was finally nearing completion and she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: \"as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book \u2013Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it \u2013 that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self\u2013.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;135.</ref>\n\n==== Searching for a publisher ====\n[[File:John Brown. Meeting the slave-mother and her child on the steps of Charlestown jail on his way to execution LCCN2003674588.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Abolitionist drawing of a scene that probably never happened: John Brown meets a slave mother and her child while being led to execution]]\nIn May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn't able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain's prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1859 the anti-slavery activist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] tried to incite a slave rebellion at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]]. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs's second attempt to get her story printed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n==== Lydia Maria Child as the book's editor ====\nJacobs now contacted [[Thayer and Eldridge]], who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown.<ref>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown by James Redpath.</ref> Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she \"resolved to make my last effort\".<ref>Jacobs to Post, October 8, 1860, cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140 and note on p.314.</ref>\n\nJacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested to drop the final chapter on Brown, and to add more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion]]. During this work she kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;140-142.</ref>\n\nAfter the book had been [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;142-143.</ref>\n\nIn January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled ''A True Tale of Slavery'', in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.\n\nIn her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn't mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called \"William\" in his sister's book) mentions Edenton as his birth place and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is \"Dr. Flint\" in Harriet's book, but \"Dr. N-\" in John's. An author's name is not given on the title page, but the \"Preface by the author\" is signed \"Linda Brent\" and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.\n\n==== Reception of the book ====\nThe book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;151-152.</ref>\n\nThe publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda\", thereby conceding her the honorific \"Mrs.\" which normally was reserved for married women.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> The ''[[The Daily News (UK)|London Daily News]]'' wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true \"heroine\", giving an example \"of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty\" and \"moral rectitude\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;152.</ref>\n\n=== Civil War and Reconstruction ===\n==== Relief work and politics ====\n[[File:The Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.jpg|thumb|right|Heroicized painting of the famous assault on [[Fort Wagner]] by the 54th Massachusetts, July 1863.]]\n[[File:Slave pen. Interior view01468v.jpg|thumb|left|Slave pen of an unnamed trader in Alexandria, Virginia. Photograph from the 1860s. Jacobs describes her visit to Birch's (formerly [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield's]]) slave pen in her report ''Life among the Contrabands''.]]\nAfter the [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of president [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in November 1860, the slavery question caused first the secession of most slave states and then the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Thousands of African Americans, having escaped from slavery in the South, gathered just north of the front. Since Lincoln's administration continued to regard them as their masters' property, these refugees were in most cases declared \"contraband of war\" and simply called \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|Contrabands]]\". Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the ''Contrabands'' would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and neighboring [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled ''Life among the Contrabands'', published in September in Garrison's ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. The author was featured as \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of 'Linda'\". This report is a description of the fugitives' misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the [[freedman|freedmen]] will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.<ref>{{citation|title=Life among the Contrabands|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support5.html|access-date=December 22, 2019\n}}. Summary of the report in: Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nDuring the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of ''Incidents'' to build up a network to support her relief work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;161-162.</ref> The ''New York Friends'' (i.e. the [[Quakers]]) gave her credentials as a relief agent.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;164.</ref>\n\nFrom January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker [[Julia Wilbur]], the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]],<ref>For the symbolic and political value of this regiment cf. David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, pp.&nbsp;388\u2013402, especially p.&nbsp;398.</ref> consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: \"How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !\" <ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n==== The Jacobs School ====\n[[File:Jacobs School 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs and their students in front of the Jacobs School, Alexandria, Virginia, 1864]]\nIn most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the ''Jacobs School'' opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda's leadership. In the ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised \"to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters\", to develop \"respect for their race\".<ref>H.Jacobs to L.M.Child, published in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', entitled {{citation|title=Letter from Teachers of the Freedmen|date=April 16, 1864|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support4.html|access-date=December 31, 2019\n}}; cf.

For the context, pp.&nbsp;176-178.</ref>\n\nJacobs's work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the ''[[Women's Loyal National League]]'', a women's organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which aimed at collecting signatures for a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] to abolish slavery.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

New York 2004, p.&nbsp;181\u2013183.</ref> On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;162, cf. p.&nbsp;167.</ref>\n\n==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]], depicting the President disbanding the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].]]\n[[File:Visit of the Ku-Klux 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Terror by the Ku-Klux-Klan, engraving published in [[Harper's Weekly]], February 1872]]\nMother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves,<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;186.</ref> they followed the call of the ''New England Freedmen's Aid Society'' for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They arrived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013194.</ref>\n\nBut the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor [[Andrew Johnson]] was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by the former masters with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs's reports from Georgia.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nAlready in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she untertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the [[Ku-Klux-Klan]] and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the ''New York Friends''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;210-211, 217 and note on p.&nbsp;345.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s a personal tragedy occurred: In the early 1850s, her son Joseph had gone to California to [[California Gold Rush|search for gold]] together with his uncle John. Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;224-225.</ref>\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HarrietJacobsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Harriet Jacobs]]\nAfter her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she kept a [[boarding house]] together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby [[Harvard University]]. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, \"Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord\". (Cf. [[Epistle to the Romans]], 12:11-12)<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013261.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nPrior to [[Jean Fagan Yellin]]'s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as [[John Blassingame]], was that ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' was a fictional novel written by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the [[Amy Post]] papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of ''Incidents,'' and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;xv-xx; Yellin, Jean Fagan and others, eds., The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers, 2 vols. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), p.&nbsp;xxiii.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled ''The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;xx, 268; Yellin, Jean Fagan and others, eds., The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers, 2 vols.

Reynolds]] states that ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' \"and ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave'' are commonly viewed as the two most important slave narratives.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/books/to-be-a-slave.html| title=To Be a Slave| work=the New York Times| author= David S.
