MacDonald]]. The plot revolves around McGee's investigation into the death of his close friend Tush Bannon, who he suspects has been murdered because of his refusal to sell his waterfront property to developers. In terms of series [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], ''Pale Gray for Guilt'' is particularly important in that it involves a [[love interest]], Puss Killian, who is central to the final book: ''[[The Lonely Silver Rain]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nWhen McGee visits Tush Bannon, his wife Janine and their children at their motel/marina, he finds the business in trouble.  Tush explains that the local authorities are making life difficult for him by such means as introducing roadworks on the only access road.  Pressure is being put on the Bannons by a well-connected local businessman, Preston LaFrance, to sell to a large corporation that wants to develop the land for industrial use.  Most of the income they have left is from a few houseboats, one of which is rented to Arlie Denn and her husband, hippies who make a small living selling handicrafts.\n\nThe next time McGee sees Tush, they bump into one another at a bar, where Tush is in conversation with a smart young woman named Mary Smith.  He tells McGee that Smith is an agent for an entrepreneur named Gary Santo, who wants to acquire the whole parcel of land.  Tush has appealed to both LaFrance and Santo without success; they are not interested in his personal circumstances and are prepared to put him out of business to get what they want.  Tush cannot afford to sell his land at the deflated price now being offered.  All he can do now is to resume his old job as a salesman.\n\nWhen McGee next goes to call on the Bannons, he finds the motel and marina closed down, and learns that Tush was found dead on the premises the previous day, apparently having committed suicide by releasing a heavy hoist onto his own head.  Suspecting foul play, McGee investigates further and learns that Tush's wife Janine, having been forced to leave the property by bailiffs, has gone to stay with an old friend, Connie Alvarez, and is not yet aware of her husband's death.  Satisfied that Tush did not kill himself, McGee begins a campaign to help Janine and her children financially whilst seeking revenge on those whom he holds responsible.\n\nWith help from his friend Meyer, McGee builds up an elaborate scam.  They con LaFrance into buying the Bannon land at an inflated price and the profits are used to buy Janine shares in Fletchers, a company whose stocks Meyer knows to be over-priced.  McGee then obtains an introduction to Gary Santo through Mary Smith, avoiding the latter's sexual advances by pretending to be away setting up a deal.  He persuades Santo to invest heavily in Fletchers, thus artificially boosting the share price, selling off Janine's shares when the market peaks.  McGee's girlfriend, Puss Killian, also plays a part in the scam, but then disappears, leaving a mysterious note of apology, saying that their affair is at an end.\n\nIn the meantime, McGee has been arrested by the local sheriff on suspicion of involvement in Tush Bannon's murder.  Testifying against him is Arlie Denn, who witnessed the murder and has been bought off by the murderer, Freddy Hazzard, a junior deputy related to LaFrance.  Hazzard, who had set up the suicide scenario after accidentally killing Tush by an over-enthusiastic beating, goes on the run when Arlie changes her story, but reappears later on McGee's boat, ''The Busted Flush'', where he takes Janine hostage and subjects her and McGee to an ordeal of several hours imprisonment, his plan being to sink the boat with them in it and get away on its small speedboat.  McGee manages to get free, but is shot in the shoulder by Hazzard, who is then killed by Janine with a blow from a fire extinguisher.  Wishing to avoid publicity, McGee and Janine agree to bury Hazzard at sea and they spend some time together on a fake holiday before returning to base, where McGee is confronted by Santo and Smith.  Learning how he has been stung, Santo fires Smith, but she quickly loses interest in McGee.  A message of explanation from Puss Killian makes him resolve to stay away from women for the foreseeable future, and he is left alone with Meyer to resume his usual way of life.\n\n==Themes==\n\nThe title phase, \"Pale Gray for Guilt\" is not mentioned directly in the book, but similar phrases are used.  In the first edition, on Page 39, Tush Bannon's wife states, \"I'm going to look at some nice gray skin.  Gray and pale, oily and guilty as hell.\"  Later on Page 183, MacDonald writes, \"And I watched the gray appear.  That gray like a wet stone.  Gray for fright.  Gray for guilt.  Gray for despair.\"\n\nMcGee procures $60,000 from one of the characters using a [[Pigeon Drop]] scheme with the help of Meyer who assumes the semi-pseudonym of \"Dr. G. Ludweg Meyer.\"  Later on, Meyer presents McGee with $25,000 in stock gains from investments in Fletcher Industries.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=The Red Hot Typewriter: The Life and Times of John D.

Twain promoted the album with television performances, festival appearances and interviews and embarked on the [[Now Tour (Shania Twain)|Now Tour]] in May 2018.\n\n==Background==\nAfter releasing the compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Shania Twain album)|Greatest Hits]]'' in 2004, Twain released the single \"[[Shoes (Shania Twain song)|Shoes]]\" for the [[Music from and Inspired by Desperate Housewives|soundtrack]] to the television series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. Later, experiencing the breakdown of her marriage, Twain divorced her longtime husband and songwriting partner, music producer [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], in 2008. She remarried to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Thi\u00e9baud, the husband of her former best friend, in 2011. The same year, she released the promotional single \"[[Today Is Your Day]]\", which had a moderate impact on the charts.\n\nTwain underwent vocal therapy after being diagnosed with [[dysphonia]] and [[Lyme disease]], which caused her to nearly lose her singing voice;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/shania-twain-dysphonia-voice/|title=Shania Twain Diagnosed With Dysphonia, Undergoes Therapy to Restore Her Voice|website=Taste of Country|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}</ref> she embarked on a [[Rock This Country Tour|concert tour]] and [[Shania: Still the One|Las Vegas residency]] before revealing that new music would arrive in 2017.\n\n==Singles==\nTwain premiered \"Life's About to Get Good\", the album's lead single, at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] in April 2017 before officially releasing it as a single on June 15, 2017.

The Xiongnu were also active in areas now part of [[Siberia]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]]. Their relations with adjacent Chinese dynasties to the south east were complex, with repeated periods of conflict and intrigue, alternating with exchanges of [[tribute]], trade, and marriage treaties ([[heqin]]).\n\nDuring the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] era, they were also known as one of the [[Five Barbarians]] who took part in an uprising against Chinese rule known as the [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]].\n\nAttempts to identify the Xiongnu with later groups of the western [[Eurasian Steppe]] remain controversial. [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]] were concurrently to the west. The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses, because only a few words, mainly titles and personal names, were preserved in the Chinese sources.

This new political unity transformed them into a more formidable state by enabling formation of larger armies and the ability to exercise better strategic coordination. The Xiongnu adopted many of the Chinese agriculture techniques such as slaves for heavy labor, wore silk like the Chinese, and lived in Chinese-style homes.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H., ''Old World Encounters,'' 1993, pg. 38</ref> The reason for creating the confederation remains unclear. Suggestions include the need for a stronger state to deal with the [[Qin's wars of unification|Qin unification of China]]<ref>Barfield 1989</ref> that resulted in a loss of the Ordos region at the hands of [[Meng Tian]] or the political crisis that overtook the Xiongnu in 215 BC when [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] armies evicted them from their pastures on the [[Yellow River]].<ref>di Cosmo 1999: 885\u2013966</ref>\n\nAfter forging internal unity, [[Modu Chanyu]] expanded the empire on all sides. To the north he conquered a number of nomadic peoples, including the [[Dingling]] of southern Siberia. He crushed the power of the [[Donghu people]] of eastern Mongolia and Manchuria as well as the [[Yuezhi]] in the [[Hexi Corridor]] of [[Gansu]], where his son, Jizhu, made a [[skull cup]] out of the [[Yuezhi]] king. Modu also reoccupied all the lands previously taken by the Qin general Meng Tian.\n\nUnder Modu's leadership, the Xiongnu threatened the Han dynasty, almost causing [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]], the first Han emperor, to lose his throne in 200 BC.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\" /> By the time of Modu's death in 174 BC, the Xiongnu had driven the Yuezhi from the Hexi Corridor, killing the Yuezhi king in the process and asserting their presence in the [[Western Regions]].<ref name=Rene />\n\nThe Xiongnu were recognized as the most prominent of the nomads bordering the Chinese Han empire<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\">Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 36.</ref> and during early relations between the Xiongnu and the Han, the former held the balance of power.

At the [[Battle of Baideng]], he was ambushed reputedly by Xiongnu cavalry. The emperor was cut off from supplies and reinforcements for seven days, only narrowly escaping capture.\n\nThe Han sent princesses to marry Xiongnu leaders in their efforts to stop the border raids. Along with arranged marriages, the Han sent gifts to bribe the Xiongnu to stop attacking.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\" /> After the defeat at Pingcheng in 200 BC, the Han emperor abandoned a military solution to the Xiongnu threat. Instead, in 198 BC{{nbsp}}, the courtier {{Interlanguage link multi|Liu Jing (Han dynasty)|zh|3=\u5289\u656c (\u897f\u6f22)|lt=Liu Jing}} was dispatched for negotiations. The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a Han princess given in marriage to the ''chanyu'' (called ''[[heqin]]'') ({{zh|c=\u548c\u89aa|l=harmonious kinship}}); periodic gifts to the Xiongnu of [[silk]], [[distilled beverage]]s and [[rice]]; equal status between the states; and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] as mutual border.\n\nThis first treaty set the pattern for relations between the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and the Xiongnu for sixty years. Up to 135&nbsp;BC, the treaty was renewed nine times, each time with an increase in the \"gifts\" to the Xiongnu Empire. In 192&nbsp;BC, [[Modu Chanyu|Modun]] even asked for the hand of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] widow [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. His son and successor, the energetic Jiyu, known as the [[Laoshang Chanyu]], continued his father's expansionist policies. Laoshang succeeded in negotiating with [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] terms for the maintenance of a large scale government sponsored market system.\n\nWhile the Xiongnu benefited handsomely, from the Chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly, very humiliating, and ineffective. [[Laoshang Chanyu]] showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously. On one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near [[Chang'an]]. In 166 BC he personally led 140,000 cavalry to invade [[Anding District, Tainan|Anding]], reaching as far as the imperial retreat at Yong. In 158 BC, his successor sent 30,000 cavalry to attack [[Shangdang]] and another 30,000 to [[Yunzhong Commandery|Yunzhong]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Xiongnu also [[Heqin#Xiongnu|practiced marriage alliances with Han dynasty officers and officials]] who defected to their side. The older sister of the Chanyu (the Xiongnu ruler) was married to the Xiongnu General [[Zhao Xin]], the Marquis of Xi who was serving the Han dynasty.

By that point the empire was consolidated politically, militarily and economically, and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court. In that year, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty.\n\nFull-scale war broke out in autumn 129 BC, when 40,000 Chinese [[cavalry]] made a surprise attack on the Xiongnu at the border markets. In 127 BC, the Han general [[Wei Qing]] retook the Ordos. In 121 BC, the Xiongnu suffered another setback when [[Huo Qubing]] led a force of light cavalry westward out of Longxi and within six days fought his way through five Xiongnu kingdoms. The Xiongnu Hunye king was forced to surrender with 40,000 men. In 119 BC both Huo and Wei, each leading 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 footsoldiers (in order to keep up with the mobility of the Xiongnu, many of the non-cavalry Han soldiers were mobile infantrymen who traveled on horseback but fought on foot), and advancing along different routes, forced the chanyu and his Xiongnu court to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].{{Sfn | Loewe | 1974}}{{Page needed |date=December 2014}} Major logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns. According to the analysis of Yan You (\u56b4\u5c24), the difficulties were twofold. Firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances.  Secondly, the weather in the northern Xiongnu lands was difficult for Han soldiers, who could never carry enough fuel.{{NoteTag|This view was put forward to [[Wang Mang]] in AD 14{{Refn|''Han Shu'' (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju ed) 94B, p. 3824.}}.}} According to official reports, the Xiongnu lost 80,000 to 90,000 men, and out of the 140,000 horses the Han forces had brought into the desert, fewer than 30,000 returned to China.\n\nIn 104 and 102 BC, the Han fought and won the [[War of the Heavenly Horses]] against the Kingdom of [[Dayuan]]. As a result, the Han gained many [[Ferghana horse]]s which further aided them in their battle against the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] and Gansu corridor to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people]]s to the south, and also gained direct access to the [[Western Regions]]. Because of strong Chinese control over the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu became unstable and were no longer a threat to the Han Chinese.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H, \"Old World Encounters\", 1993, p. 37</ref>\n\n[[File:Asia 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Xiongnu among other people in Asia around 1 AD.]]\n[[Ban Chao]], Protector General (\u90fd\u8b77; ''Duhu'') of the Han dynasty, embarked with an army of 70,000 soldiers in a campaign against the Xiongnu remnants who were harassing the trade route now known as the [[Silk Road]].  His successful military campaign saw the subjugation of one Xiongnu tribe after another. Ban Chao also sent an envoy named [[Gan Ying]] to [[Daqin]] (Rome).  Ban Chao was created the Marquess of Dingyuan (\u5b9a\u9060\u4faf, i.e., \"the Marquess who stabilized faraway places\") for his services to the Han Empire and returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] at the age of 70 years and died there in the year 102.  Following his death, the power of the Xiongnu in the Western Regions increased again, and the emperors of subsequent dynasties did not reach as far west until the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 42\u201347] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 }}</ref>\n\n=== Xiongnu Civil War (60\u201353 BC) ===\nWhen a Chanyu died, power could pass to his younger brother if his son was not of age. This system, which can be compared to Gaelic [[tanistry]], normally kept an adult male on the throne, but could cause trouble in later generations when there were several lineages that might claim the throne.  When the 12th Chanyu died in 60 BC, power was taken by Woyanqudi, a grandson of the 12th Chanyu's cousin. Being something of a usurper, he tried to put his own men in power, which only increased the number of his enemies. The 12th Chanyu's son fled east and, in 58 BC, revolted. Few would support Woyanqudi and he was driven to suicide, leaving the rebel son, [[Huhanye]], as the 14th Chanyu. The Woyanqudi faction then set up his brother, Tuqi, as Chanyu (58 BC). In 57 BC three more men declared themselves Chanyu. Two dropped their claims in favor of the third who was defeated by Tuqi in that year and surrendered to Huhanye the following year. In 56 BC Tuqi was defeated by Huhanye and committed suicide, but two more claimants appeared: Runzhen and Huhanye's elder brother [[Zhizhi Chanyu]]. Runzhen was killed by Zhizhi in 54 BC, leaving only Zhizhi and Huhanye. Zhizhi grew in power, and, in 53 BC, Huhanye moved south and submitted to the Chinese. Huhanye used Chinese support to weaken Zhizhi, who gradually moved west. In 49 BC, a brother to Tuqi set himself up as Chanyu and was killed by Zhizhi. In 36 BC, Zhizhi was killed by a Chinese army while trying to establish a new kingdom in the far west near [[Lake Balkhash]].\n\n=== Tributary relations with the Han ===\n[[File:Bronze seal of a Xiongnu chief.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bronze seal says \"To '''Han''' obedient, friendly and loyal chief of Xiongnu of '''Han''' ('''\u6f22'''\u5308\u5974\u6b78\u7fa9\u89aa'''\u6f22'''\u9577)\"\uff0eBronze seal conferred by the Eastern Han government on a Xiongnu chief.]]\nIn 53 BC [[Huhanye]] (\u547c\u97d3\u90aa) decided to enter into tributary relations with [[Han China]].<ref name=Rene1>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 37\u201338] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 }}</ref> The original terms insisted on by the Han court were that, first, the ''Chanyu'' or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage; secondly, the ''Chanyu'' should send a hostage prince; and thirdly, the ''Chanyu'' should present tribute to the Han emperor. The political status of the Xiongnu in the Chinese world order was reduced from that of a \"brotherly state\" to that of an \"outer vassal\" (\u5916\u81e3). During this period, however, the Xiongnu maintained political sovereignty and full territorial integrity. The [[Great Wall of China]] continued to serve as the line of demarcation between Han and Xiongnu.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHuhanye sent his son, the \"wise king of the right\" Shuloujutang, to the Han court as hostage. In 51 BC he personally visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor on the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. In the same year, another envoy Qijushan (\u7a3d\u5c45\u72e6) was received at the [[Sweet Spring Palace]] in the north west of modern [[Shanxi]].{{sfn|Fairbank & T\u00eang|1941}} On the financial side, Huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold, cash, clothes, silk, horses and grain for his participation. Huhanye made two further homage trips, in 49 BC and 33 BC; with each one the imperial gifts were increased. On the last trip, Huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. As a sign of the decline in the political status of the Xiongnu, [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] refused, giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting. One of them was [[Wang Zhaojun]], famed in Chinese folklore as one of the [[Four Beauties]].\n\nWhen Zhizhi learned of his brother's submission, he also sent a son to the Han court as hostage in 53&nbsp;BC. Then twice, in 51 BC and 50 BC, he sent envoys to the Han court with tribute. But having failed to pay homage personally, he was never admitted to the tributary system. In 36 BC, a junior officer named [[Chen Tang]], with the help of Gan Yanshou, protector-general of the Western Regions, assembled an expeditionary force that defeated him at the [[Battle of Zhizhi]] and sent his head as a trophy to Chang'an.\n\nTributary relations were discontinued during the reign of Huduershi (18 AD\u201348), corresponding to the political upheavals of the [[Xin Dynasty]] in China. The Xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions, as well as neighboring peoples such as the [[Wuhuan]]. In 24 AD, Hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system.\n\n=== Southern Xiongnu and Northern Xiongnu ===\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = horizontal|header=|header_align = left/right/center|footer = An [[Eastern Han]] Chinese glazed ceramic statue of a horse with [[bridle]] and [[halter]] headgear, from [[Sichuan]], late 2nd century to early 3rd century AD|footer_align = left|image1 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 02.JPG|width1 = 130|caption1 =|image2 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 03.JPG|width2 = 263|caption2 =}}\nThe Xiongnu's new power was met with a policy of appeasement by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]. At the height of his power, Huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor, Modu. Due to growing regionalism among the Xiongnu, however, Huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority. In contravention of a principle of [[fraternal succession]] established by Huhanye, Huduershi designated his son Punu as [[heir-apparent]]. However, as the eldest son of the preceding ''chanyu'', Bi (Pi) \u2013 the Rizhu King of the Right \u2013 had a more legitimate claim. Consequently, Bi refused to attend the annual meeting at the ''chanyu'''s court. Nevertheless, in 46 AD, Punu ascended the throne.\n\nIn 48 AD, a confederation of eight Xiongnu tribes in Bi's power base in the south, with a military force totalling 40,000 to 50,000 men, seceded from Punu's kingdom and acclaimed Bi as ''chanyu''.

Consequently, in 50 AD, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to tributary relations with Han China. The system of tribute was considerably tightened by the Han, to keep the Southern Xiongnu under control. The ''chanyu'' was ordered to establish his court in the Meiji district of [[Xihe Commandery]] and the Southern Xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies. At the same time, large numbers of Chinese were also resettled in these commanderies, in mixed Han-Xiongnu settlements. Economically, the Southern Xiongnu became reliant on trade with the Han.\n\nTensions were evident between Han settlers and practitioners of the nomadic way of life. Thus, in 94, Anguo Chanyu joined forces with newly subjugated Xiongnu from the north and started a large scale rebellion against the Han.\n\nDuring the late 2nd century AD, the southern Xiongnu were drawn into the rebellions then plaguing the Han court. In 188, the ''chanyu'' was murdered by some of his own subjects for agreeing to send troops to help the Han suppress a rebellion in [[Hebei]] \u2013 many of the Xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the Han court. The murdered ''chanyu's'' son [[Yufuluo]], entitled Chizhisizhu ({{lang|zh|\u6301\u81f3\u5c38\u9010\u4faf}}), succeeded him, but was then overthrown by the same rebellious faction in 189. He travelled to [[Luoyang]] (the Han capital) to seek aid from the Han court, but at this time the Han court was in disorder from the clash between Grand General [[He Jin]] and the eunuchs, and the intervention of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]]. The ''chanyu'' had no choice but to settle down with his followers in [[Linfen|Pingyang]], a city in [[Shanxi]]. In 195, he died and was succeeded as ''chanyu'' by his brother [[Huchuquan Chanyu]].\n\nIn 215\u2013216 AD, the warlord-statesman [[Cao Cao]] detained [[Huchuquan Chanyu]] in the city of [[Ye, China|Ye]], and divided his followers in Shanxi into five divisions: left, right, south, north, and centre. This was aimed at preventing the exiled Xiongnu in Shanxi from engaging in rebellion, and also allowed Cao Cao to use the Xiongnu as auxiliaries in his cavalry.\n\nLater the Xiongnu aristocracy in Shanxi changed their surname from [[Luanti]] to Liu for prestige reasons, claiming that they were related to the Han imperial clan through the old intermarriage policy. After Huchuquan, the Southern Xiongnu were partitioned into five local tribes.  Each local chief was under the \"surveillance of a chinese resident\", while the shanyu was in \"semicaptivity at the imperial court.\"<ref name=Rene111>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 54] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 }}</ref>\n\n=== Later Xiongnu states in northern China ===\nThe Southern Xiongnu that settled in northern China during the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] retained their tribal affiliation and political organization and played an active role in Chinese politics.

Their remnants were then settled in the city of [[Gaochang]] before being destroyed by the [[Rouran]].\n\n== Significance ==\nThe Xiongnu confederation was unusually long-lived for a steppe empire. The purpose of raiding China was not simply for goods, but to force the Chinese to pay regular tribute. The power of the Xiongnu ruler was based on his control of Chinese tribute which he used to reward his supporters. The Han and Xiongnu empires rose at the same time because the Xiongnu state depended on Chinese tribute.  A major Xiongnu weakness was the custom of lateral succession. If a dead ruler's son was not old enough to take command, power passed to the late ruler's brother. This worked in the first generation but could lead to civil war in the second generation. The first time this happened, in 60 BC, the weaker party adopted what Barfield calls the 'inner frontier strategy.'  They moved south and submitted to China and then used Chinese resources to defeat the Northern Xiongnu and re-establish the empire.  The second time this happened, about 47 AD, the strategy failed. The southern ruler was unable to defeat the northern ruler and the Xiongnu remained divided.<ref>{{Citation|last=Barfield|first=Thomas J|title=The Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China, 221 BC to AD 1757|year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== Ethnolinguistic origins{{anchor|Language}} ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Pronunciation of \u5308<br /> <small>Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929174528/http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=%5Cdata%5Cchina%5Cbigchina&first=1&text_character=%E5%8C%88 http://starling.rinet.ru]</small>\n|-\n|Preclassic [[Old Chinese]]: || {{IPA|s\u014bo\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Classic Old Chinese: || {{IPA-ltc|\u014b\u030ao\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Postclassic Old Chinese: || {{IPA|ho\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Middle Chinese]]: || {{IPA|x\u00f6u\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Standard Mandarin|Modern Mandarin]]: || {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1}}\n|}\n[[File:East-Hem 300ad.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Xiongnu and other steppe nations in 300 AD.]]\n\nThe Chinese name for the Xiongnu was a [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative term in itself]], as the characters (\u5308\u5974) have the meaning of \"fierce slave\".<ref name=yuuu86-384 /> (The Chinese characters are pronounced as ''Xi\u014dngn\u00fa'' {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1|n|u|2}} in modern [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]].)\n\nThere are several theories on the ethnolinguistic identity of the Xiongnu.\n\n=== Huns ===\n{{see also|Origin of the Huns}}\nThe sound of the first Chinese character (\u5308) in the name has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/q\u02b0o\u014b/}} in Old Chinese.<ref>Baxter-Sagart (2014).</ref> This sound has a possible similarity with the name \"[[Huns|Hun]]\" in European languages. The second character (\u5974) appears to have no parallel in Western terminology. Whether the similarity is evidence of kinship or mere coincidence is hard to tell. It could lend credence to the theory that the Huns were in fact descendants of the Northern Xiongnu who migrated westward, or that the Huns were using a name borrowed from the Northern Xiongnu, or that these Xiongnu made up part of the Hun confederation.\n\nThe Xiongnu-Hun hypothesis originated with the 18th-century French historian [[Joseph de Guignes]], who noticed that ancient Chinese scholars had referred to members of tribes associated with the Xiongnu by names similar to \"Hun\", albeit with varying Chinese characters. [[\u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re]] has shown that, in the [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian script]] used in the so-called \"[[Sogdian Ancient Letters]]\", both the Xiongnu and Huns were referred to as \u03b3wn (''xwn''), indicating that the two were synonymous.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vaissi\u00e8re|first=\u00c9tienne|title=Xiongnu|url=https://www.academia.edu/2455107|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica}}</ref> DNA testing of the remains of purported Huns has so far proved inconclusive in determining their origin.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Although the theory that the Xiongnu were precursors of the Huns known later in Europe is now accepted by many scholars, it has yet to become a consensus view. The identification with the Huns may be either incorrect or an oversimplification (as would appear to be the case with a [[Proto-Mongols|proto-Mongol]] people, the [[Rouran]], who have sometimes been linked to the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars of Central Europe]]).\n\n=== Iranian theories ===\n{{See also|Iranian languages}}\n[[Harold Walter Bailey]] proposed an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin of the Xiongnu, recognizing all the earliest Xiongnu names of the 2nd century BC as being of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] type.<ref name=\"Bailey21\" /> This theory is supported by [[Turkology|turkologist]] [[:pl:Henryk Jankowski (turkolog)|Henryk Jankowski]].<ref name=\"Jankowski26\" /> Central Asian scholar [[Christopher I.

From a Xiongnu tomb on the frontier, 4th\u20133rd century BC]]\n\n=== Artistic distinctions ===\n{{One source|section|date=December 2012}}\nWithin the Xiongnu culture more variety is visible from site to site than from \"era\" to \"era,\" in terms of the Chinese chronology, yet all form a whole that is distinct from that of the Han and other peoples of the non-Chinese north.<ref name=\"Psarras\">{{cite journal|last=Psarras|first=Sophia-Karin|title=Han and Xiongnu: A Reexamination of Cultural and Political Relations|journal=Monumenta Serica|year=2003|volume=51|pages=55\u2013236|jstor=40727370|doi=10.1080/02549948.2003.11731391}}</ref> In some instances iconography can not be used as the main cultural identifier because art depicting animal predation is common among the steppe peoples. An example of animal predation associated with Xiongnu culture is a tiger carrying dead prey.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> We see a similar image in work from Maoqinggou, a site which is presumed to have been under Xiongnu political control but is still clearly non-Xiongnu. From Maoqinggou, we see the prey replaced by an extension of the tiger's foot. The work also depicts a lower level of execution; Maoqinggou work was executed in a rounder, less detailed style.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> In its broadest sense, Xiongnu iconography of animal predation include examples such as the gold headdress from Aluchaideng and gold earrings with a turquoise and jade inlay discovered in Xigouban, Inner Mongolia.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The gold headdress can be viewed, along with some other examples of Xiongnu art, from the external links at the bottom of this article.\n\nXiongnu art is harder to distinguish from [[Saka]] or [[Scythian art]]. There was a similarity present in stylistic execution, but Xiongnu art and Saka art did often differ in terms of iconography. Saka art does not appear to have included predation scenes, especially with dead prey, or same-animal combat. Additionally, Saka art included elements not common to Xiongnu iconography, such as a winged, horned horse.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The two cultures also used two different bird heads. Xiongnu depictions of birds have a tendency to have a moderate eye and beak and have ears, while Saka birds have a pronounced eye and beak and no ears.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}} Some scholars{{who|date=November 2014}} claim these differences are indicative of cultural differences. Scholar Sophia-Karin Psarras claims that Xiongnu images of animal predation, specifically tiger plus prey, is spiritual, representative of death and rebirth, and same-animal combat is representative of the acquisition of or maintenance of power.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}}\n\n=== Rock art and writing ===\nThe rock art of the [[Yin Mountains|Yin]] and [[Helan Mountains]] is dated from the 9th millennium BC to the 19th century AD. It consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and only minimally of painted images.<ref>Dematt\u00e8 2006</ref>\n\nExcavations conducted between 1924 and 1925 in the Noin-Ula kurgans produced objects with over twenty carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to that of to the runic letters of the [[Old Turkic alphabet]] discovered in the [[Orkhon Valley]]. From this a some scholars hold that the Xiongnu had a script similar to Eurasian runiform and this alphabet itself served as the basis for the ancient Turkic writing.<ref>Ishjamts 1996: 166</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (vol. [[:zh:s:\u53f2\u8a18/\u5377110|110]]) state that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood; they also mention a \"Hu script\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Fig6Ishjamts p166R1.gif|2nd century BCE \u2013 2nd century CE characters of Hun-[[Xianbei]] script (Mongolia and Inner Mongolia), N.

From their lifestyle of herding flocks and their horse-trade with China, it can be concluded that their diet consist mainly of [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], [[horse meat]] and wild geese that were shot down.\n\n== Possible connection to Korean Silla Dynasty ==\nIn various kinds of ancient inscriptions on monuments of [[Munmu of Silla]], it is recorded that King Munmu possibly came from an unknown Xiongnu-tribe or that he has partially Xiongnu ancestry. According to several historians, it is possible that this unknown tribe was originally of [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] origin and joined the Xiongnu confederation. Later the tribes ruling family returned to Korea and married into the royal family of Silla. There are also some Korean researchers that point out that the grave goods of Silla and of the eastern Xiongnu are alike.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Cho Gab-je|date= |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\u9a0e\u99ac\ud749\ub178\uad6d\uac00 \u65b0\u7f85 \uc5f0\uad6c\u3000\u8d99\u7532\u6fdf(\u6708\u520a\u671d\u9bae \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc7a5)\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35\ucde8\uc7ac\u3000\ub0b4 \ubab8\uc18d\uc744 \ud750\ub974\ub294 \ud749\ub178\uc758 \ud53c|publisher=[[Monthly Chosun]]|url=http://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?nNewsNumb=200403100027&ctcd=&cpage=1|accessdate=2016-09-25|author-link= Cho Gab-je}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=\uae40\uc6b4\ud68c|date=2005-08-30 |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\uae40\uc6b4\ud68c\uc758 '\ub300\uc96c\uc2e0\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544\uc11c' <23> \uae08\uad00\uc758 \ub098\ub77c, \uc2e0\ub77c\u201d|publisher=\ud504\ub808\uc2dc\uc548|url=http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=40050830181724&Section=04|accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=|date=2009-02-27 |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\uacbd\uc8fc \uc0ac\ucc9c\uc655\uc0ac(\u5bfa) \uc0ac\ucc9c\uc655\uc0c1(\u56db\u5929\u738b\u50cf) \uc65c 4\uac1c\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c 3\uac1c\uc77c\uae4c|publisher=\uc870\uc120\uc77c\ubcf4|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/26/2009022601873.html|accessdate=2016-09-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230090440/http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/26/2009022601873.html|archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref><ref>\uae40\ucc3d\ud638, \u3008\ubb38\ubb34\uc655\ub989\ube44\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uc870\uc0c1\uc778\uc2dd \u2013 \ud0dc\uc870\uc131\ud55c\uc758 \ucca8\ubcf4 -\u3009, \u300a\ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\uc5f0\uad6c\u300b, \ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\uc5f0\uad6c\ud68c, 1986\ub144</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nl.go.kr/nl/search/SearchDetail.nl?category_code=ct&service=KOLIS&vdkvgwkey=14167918&colltype=YON_ART&place_code_info=132&place_name_info=%EC%97%B0%EC%86%8D%EA%B0%84%ED%96%89%EB%AC%BC%EC%8B%A4(3%EC%B8%B5)&manage_code=MA&shape_code=B&refLoc=portal&category=storage&srchFlag=Y&h_kwd=%E6%96%B0%E7%BE%85%E5%BB%BA%E5%9C%8B%E8%A8%AD%E8%A9%B1%EC%9D%98+%E7%A1%8F%E7%A9%B6%7C4%E8%BC%AF(1972%EB%85%84+5%EC%9B%94),+p.+1-52|title=\uc790\ub8cc\uac80\uc0c9>\uc0c1\uc138_\uae30\uc0ac {{!}} \uad6d\ub9bd\uc911\uc559\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00|website=www.nl.go.kr|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Chanyu#List of Xiongnu Chanyus|List of Xiongnu rulers (Chanyus)]]\n* [[Chanyu#Chanyu family trees|Rulers family tree]]\n* [[Nomadic empire]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[History of the Han Dynasty]]\n* [[Ban Yong]]\n* [[Zubu]]\n* [[List of largest empires]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Primary sources\n* [[Ban Gu]] et al., ''[[Book of Han]]'', esp. vol. 94, [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377094\u4e0a|part 1]], [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377094\u4e0b|part 2]].\n* [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] et al., ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', esp.

The Xiongnu were also active in areas now part of [[Siberia]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]]. Their relations with adjacent Chinese dynasties to the south east were complex, with repeated periods of conflict and intrigue, alternating with exchanges of [[tribute]], trade, and marriage treaties ([[heqin]]).\n\nDuring the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] era, they were also known as one of the [[Five Barbarians]] who took part in an uprising against Chinese rule known as the [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]].\n\nAttempts to identify the Xiongnu with later groups of the western [[Eurasian Steppe]] remain controversial. [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]] were concurrently to the west. The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses, because only a few words, mainly titles and personal names, were preserved in the Chinese sources.

This new political unity transformed them into a more formidable state by enabling formation of larger armies and the ability to exercise better strategic coordination. The Xiongnu adopted many of the Chinese agriculture techniques such as slaves for heavy labor, wore silk like the Chinese, and lived in Chinese-style homes.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H., ''Old World Encounters,'' 1993, pg. 38</ref> The reason for creating the confederation remains unclear. Suggestions include the need for a stronger state to deal with the [[Qin's wars of unification|Qin unification of China]]<ref>Barfield 1989</ref> that resulted in a loss of the Ordos region at the hands of [[Meng Tian]] or the political crisis that overtook the Xiongnu in 215 BC when [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] armies evicted them from their pastures on the [[Yellow River]].<ref>di Cosmo 1999: 885\u2013966</ref>\n\nAfter forging internal unity, [[Modu Chanyu]] expanded the empire on all sides.

At the [[Battle of Baideng]], he was ambushed reputedly by Xiongnu cavalry. The emperor was cut off from supplies and reinforcements for seven days, only narrowly escaping capture.\n\nThe Han sent princesses to marry Xiongnu leaders in their efforts to stop the border raids. Along with arranged marriages, the Han sent gifts to bribe the Xiongnu to stop attacking.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\" /> After the defeat at Pingcheng in 200 BC, the Han emperor abandoned a military solution to the Xiongnu threat. Instead, in 198 BC{{nbsp}}, the courtier {{Interlanguage link multi|Liu Jing (Han dynasty)|zh|3=\u5289\u656c (\u897f\u6f22)|lt=Liu Jing}} was dispatched for negotiations. The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a Han princess given in marriage to the ''chanyu'' (called ''[[heqin]]'') ({{zh|c=\u548c\u89aa|l=harmonious kinship}}); periodic gifts to the Xiongnu of [[silk]], [[distilled beverage]]s and [[rice]]; equal status between the states; and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] as mutual border.\n\nThis first treaty set the pattern for relations between the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and the Xiongnu for sixty years. Up to 135&nbsp;BC, the treaty was renewed nine times, each time with an increase in the \"gifts\" to the Xiongnu Empire. In 192&nbsp;BC, [[Modu Chanyu|Modun]] even asked for the hand of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] widow [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. His son and successor, the energetic Jiyu, known as the [[Laoshang Chanyu]], continued his father's expansionist policies. Laoshang succeeded in negotiating with [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] terms for the maintenance of a large scale government sponsored market system.\n\nWhile the Xiongnu benefited handsomely, from the Chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly, very humiliating, and ineffective. [[Laoshang Chanyu]] showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously. On one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near [[Chang'an]]. In 166 BC he personally led 140,000 cavalry to invade [[Anding District, Tainan|Anding]], reaching as far as the imperial retreat at Yong. In 158 BC, his successor sent 30,000 cavalry to attack [[Shangdang]] and another 30,000 to [[Yunzhong Commandery|Yunzhong]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Xiongnu also [[Heqin#Xiongnu|practiced marriage alliances with Han dynasty officers and officials]] who defected to their side. The older sister of the Chanyu (the Xiongnu ruler) was married to the Xiongnu General [[Zhao Xin]], the Marquis of Xi who was serving the Han dynasty. The daughter of the Chanyu was married to the [[Han Chinese]] General [[Li Ling]] after he surrendered and defected.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/5147439/Aristocratic_elites_in_the_Xiongnu_empire], p. 31.</ref><ref name=\"SimaWatson1993\">{{cite book|author1=Qian Sima|author2=Burton Watson|title=Records of the Grand Historian: Han dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YNlgKEVYdHEC&pg=PA161&dq=li+guangli+daughter#v=onepage&q=li%20guangli%20daughter&f=false|date=January 1993|publisher=Renditions-Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08166-5|pages=161\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Monumenta Serica|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-1wAAAAMAAJ&q=li+guangli+daughter+chanyu&dq=li+guangli+daughter+chanyu|year=2004|publisher=H.

By that point the empire was consolidated politically, militarily and economically, and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court. In that year, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty.\n\nFull-scale war broke out in autumn 129 BC, when 40,000 Chinese [[cavalry]] made a surprise attack on the Xiongnu at the border markets. In 127 BC, the Han general [[Wei Qing]] retook the Ordos. In 121 BC, the Xiongnu suffered another setback when [[Huo Qubing]] led a force of light cavalry westward out of Longxi and within six days fought his way through five Xiongnu kingdoms. The Xiongnu Hunye king was forced to surrender with 40,000 men. In 119 BC both Huo and Wei, each leading 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 footsoldiers (in order to keep up with the mobility of the Xiongnu, many of the non-cavalry Han soldiers were mobile infantrymen who traveled on horseback but fought on foot), and advancing along different routes, forced the chanyu and his Xiongnu court to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].{{Sfn | Loewe | 1974}}{{Page needed |date=December 2014}} Major logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns. According to the analysis of Yan You (\u56b4\u5c24), the difficulties were twofold. Firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances.  Secondly, the weather in the northern Xiongnu lands was difficult for Han soldiers, who could never carry enough fuel.{{NoteTag|This view was put forward to [[Wang Mang]] in AD 14{{Refn|''Han Shu'' (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju ed) 94B, p. 3824.}}.}} According to official reports, the Xiongnu lost 80,000 to 90,000 men, and out of the 140,000 horses the Han forces had brought into the desert, fewer than 30,000 returned to China.\n\nIn 104 and 102 BC, the Han fought and won the [[War of the Heavenly Horses]] against the Kingdom of [[Dayuan]]. As a result, the Han gained many [[Ferghana horse]]s which further aided them in their battle against the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] and Gansu corridor to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people]]s to the south, and also gained direct access to the [[Western Regions]]. Because of strong Chinese control over the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu became unstable and were no longer a threat to the Han Chinese.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H, \"Old World Encounters\", 1993, p. 37</ref>\n\n[[File:Asia 001ad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Xiongnu among other people in Asia around 1 AD.]]\n[[Ban Chao]], Protector General (\u90fd\u8b77; ''Duhu'') of the Han dynasty, embarked with an army of 70,000 soldiers in a campaign against the Xiongnu remnants who were harassing the trade route now known as the [[Silk Road]].  His successful military campaign saw the subjugation of one Xiongnu tribe after another. Ban Chao also sent an envoy named [[Gan Ying]] to [[Daqin]] (Rome).  Ban Chao was created the Marquess of Dingyuan (\u5b9a\u9060\u4faf, i.e., \"the Marquess who stabilized faraway places\") for his services to the Han Empire and returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] at the age of 70 years and died there in the year 102.  Following his death, the power of the Xiongnu in the Western Regions increased again, and the emperors of subsequent dynasties did not reach as far west until the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 42\u201347] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/42 }}</ref>\n\n=== Xiongnu Civil War (60\u201353 BC) ===\nWhen a Chanyu died, power could pass to his younger brother if his son was not of age. This system, which can be compared to Gaelic [[tanistry]], normally kept an adult male on the throne, but could cause trouble in later generations when there were several lineages that might claim the throne.  When the 12th Chanyu died in 60 BC, power was taken by Woyanqudi, a grandson of the 12th Chanyu's cousin. Being something of a usurper, he tried to put his own men in power, which only increased the number of his enemies. The 12th Chanyu's son fled east and, in 58 BC, revolted. Few would support Woyanqudi and he was driven to suicide, leaving the rebel son, [[Huhanye]], as the 14th Chanyu. The Woyanqudi faction then set up his brother, Tuqi, as Chanyu (58 BC). In 57 BC three more men declared themselves Chanyu. Two dropped their claims in favor of the third who was defeated by Tuqi in that year and surrendered to Huhanye the following year. In 56 BC Tuqi was defeated by Huhanye and committed suicide, but two more claimants appeared: Runzhen and Huhanye's elder brother [[Zhizhi Chanyu]]. Runzhen was killed by Zhizhi in 54 BC, leaving only Zhizhi and Huhanye. Zhizhi grew in power, and, in 53 BC, Huhanye moved south and submitted to the Chinese. Huhanye used Chinese support to weaken Zhizhi, who gradually moved west. In 49 BC, a brother to Tuqi set himself up as Chanyu and was killed by Zhizhi. In 36 BC, Zhizhi was killed by a Chinese army while trying to establish a new kingdom in the far west near [[Lake Balkhash]].\n\n=== Tributary relations with the Han ===\n[[File:Bronze seal of a Xiongnu chief.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bronze seal says \"To '''Han''' obedient, friendly and loyal chief of Xiongnu of '''Han''' ('''\u6f22'''\u5308\u5974\u6b78\u7fa9\u89aa'''\u6f22'''\u9577)\"\uff0eBronze seal conferred by the Eastern Han government on a Xiongnu chief.]]\nIn 53 BC [[Huhanye]] (\u547c\u97d3\u90aa) decided to enter into tributary relations with [[Han China]].<ref name=Rene1>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 37\u201338] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/37 }}</ref> The original terms insisted on by the Han court were that, first, the ''Chanyu'' or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage; secondly, the ''Chanyu'' should send a hostage prince; and thirdly, the ''Chanyu'' should present tribute to the Han emperor. The political status of the Xiongnu in the Chinese world order was reduced from that of a \"brotherly state\" to that of an \"outer vassal\" (\u5916\u81e3). During this period, however, the Xiongnu maintained political sovereignty and full territorial integrity. The [[Great Wall of China]] continued to serve as the line of demarcation between Han and Xiongnu.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHuhanye sent his son, the \"wise king of the right\" Shuloujutang, to the Han court as hostage. In 51 BC he personally visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor on the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]]. In the same year, another envoy Qijushan (\u7a3d\u5c45\u72e6) was received at the [[Sweet Spring Palace]] in the north west of modern [[Shanxi]].{{sfn|Fairbank & T\u00eang|1941}} On the financial side, Huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold, cash, clothes, silk, horses and grain for his participation. Huhanye made two further homage trips, in 49 BC and 33 BC; with each one the imperial gifts were increased. On the last trip, Huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. As a sign of the decline in the political status of the Xiongnu, [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] refused, giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting. One of them was [[Wang Zhaojun]], famed in Chinese folklore as one of the [[Four Beauties]].\n\nWhen Zhizhi learned of his brother's submission, he also sent a son to the Han court as hostage in 53&nbsp;BC. Then twice, in 51 BC and 50 BC, he sent envoys to the Han court with tribute. But having failed to pay homage personally, he was never admitted to the tributary system. In 36 BC, a junior officer named [[Chen Tang]], with the help of Gan Yanshou, protector-general of the Western Regions, assembled an expeditionary force that defeated him at the [[Battle of Zhizhi]] and sent his head as a trophy to Chang'an.\n\nTributary relations were discontinued during the reign of Huduershi (18 AD\u201348), corresponding to the political upheavals of the [[Xin Dynasty]] in China. The Xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions, as well as neighboring peoples such as the [[Wuhuan]]. In 24 AD, Hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system.\n\n=== Southern Xiongnu and Northern Xiongnu ===\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = horizontal|header=|header_align = left/right/center|footer = An [[Eastern Han]] Chinese glazed ceramic statue of a horse with [[bridle]] and [[halter]] headgear, from [[Sichuan]], late 2nd century to early 3rd century AD|footer_align = left|image1 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 02.JPG|width1 = 130|caption1 =|image2 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 03.JPG|width2 = 263|caption2 =}}\nThe Xiongnu's new power was met with a policy of appeasement by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]. At the height of his power, Huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor, Modu. Due to growing regionalism among the Xiongnu, however, Huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority. In contravention of a principle of [[fraternal succession]] established by Huhanye, Huduershi designated his son Punu as [[heir-apparent]]. However, as the eldest son of the preceding ''chanyu'', Bi (Pi) \u2013 the Rizhu King of the Right \u2013 had a more legitimate claim. Consequently, Bi refused to attend the annual meeting at the ''chanyu'''s court. Nevertheless, in 46 AD, Punu ascended the throne.\n\nIn 48 AD, a confederation of eight Xiongnu tribes in Bi's power base in the south, with a military force totalling 40,000 to 50,000 men, seceded from Punu's kingdom and acclaimed Bi as ''chanyu''.

Consequently, in 50 AD, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to tributary relations with Han China. The system of tribute was considerably tightened by the Han, to keep the Southern Xiongnu under control. The ''chanyu'' was ordered to establish his court in the Meiji district of [[Xihe Commandery]] and the Southern Xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies. At the same time, large numbers of Chinese were also resettled in these commanderies, in mixed Han-Xiongnu settlements. Economically, the Southern Xiongnu became reliant on trade with the Han.\n\nTensions were evident between Han settlers and practitioners of the nomadic way of life. Thus, in 94, Anguo Chanyu joined forces with newly subjugated Xiongnu from the north and started a large scale rebellion against the Han.\n\nDuring the late 2nd century AD, the southern Xiongnu were drawn into the rebellions then plaguing the Han court. In 188, the ''chanyu'' was murdered by some of his own subjects for agreeing to send troops to help the Han suppress a rebellion in [[Hebei]] \u2013 many of the Xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the Han court. The murdered ''chanyu's'' son [[Yufuluo]], entitled Chizhisizhu ({{lang|zh|\u6301\u81f3\u5c38\u9010\u4faf}}), succeeded him, but was then overthrown by the same rebellious faction in 189. He travelled to [[Luoyang]] (the Han capital) to seek aid from the Han court, but at this time the Han court was in disorder from the clash between Grand General [[He Jin]] and the eunuchs, and the intervention of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]]. The ''chanyu'' had no choice but to settle down with his followers in [[Linfen|Pingyang]], a city in [[Shanxi]]. In 195, he died and was succeeded as ''chanyu'' by his brother [[Huchuquan Chanyu]].\n\nIn 215\u2013216 AD, the warlord-statesman [[Cao Cao]] detained [[Huchuquan Chanyu]] in the city of [[Ye, China|Ye]], and divided his followers in Shanxi into five divisions: left, right, south, north, and centre. This was aimed at preventing the exiled Xiongnu in Shanxi from engaging in rebellion, and also allowed Cao Cao to use the Xiongnu as auxiliaries in his cavalry.\n\nLater the Xiongnu aristocracy in Shanxi changed their surname from [[Luanti]] to Liu for prestige reasons, claiming that they were related to the Han imperial clan through the old intermarriage policy. After Huchuquan, the Southern Xiongnu were partitioned into five local tribes.  Each local chief was under the \"surveillance of a chinese resident\", while the shanyu was in \"semicaptivity at the imperial court.\"<ref name=Rene111>{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 54] |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppesh00prof/page/54 }}</ref>\n\n=== Later Xiongnu states in northern China ===\nThe Southern Xiongnu that settled in northern China during the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] retained their tribal affiliation and political organization and played an active role in Chinese politics.

Their remnants were then settled in the city of [[Gaochang]] before being destroyed by the [[Rouran]].\n\n== Significance ==\nThe Xiongnu confederation was unusually long-lived for a steppe empire. The purpose of raiding China was not simply for goods, but to force the Chinese to pay regular tribute. The power of the Xiongnu ruler was based on his control of Chinese tribute which he used to reward his supporters. The Han and Xiongnu empires rose at the same time because the Xiongnu state depended on Chinese tribute.  A major Xiongnu weakness was the custom of lateral succession. If a dead ruler's son was not old enough to take command, power passed to the late ruler's brother. This worked in the first generation but could lead to civil war in the second generation. The first time this happened, in 60 BC, the weaker party adopted what Barfield calls the 'inner frontier strategy.'  They moved south and submitted to China and then used Chinese resources to defeat the Northern Xiongnu and re-establish the empire.  The second time this happened, about 47 AD, the strategy failed. The southern ruler was unable to defeat the northern ruler and the Xiongnu remained divided.<ref>{{Citation|last=Barfield|first=Thomas J|title=The Perilous Frontier: Nomadic Empires and China, 221 BC to AD 1757|year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== Ethnolinguistic origins{{anchor|Language}} ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Pronunciation of \u5308<br /> <small>Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929174528/http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=%5Cdata%5Cchina%5Cbigchina&first=1&text_character=%E5%8C%88 http://starling.rinet.ru]</small>\n|-\n|Preclassic [[Old Chinese]]: || {{IPA|s\u014bo\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Classic Old Chinese: || {{IPA-ltc|\u014b\u030ao\u014b|}}\n|-\n|Postclassic Old Chinese: || {{IPA|ho\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Middle Chinese]]: || {{IPA|x\u00f6u\u014b}}\n|-\n|[[Standard Mandarin|Modern Mandarin]]: || {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1}}\n|}\n[[File:East-Hem 300ad.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of Xiongnu and other steppe nations in 300 AD.]]\n\nThe Chinese name for the Xiongnu was a [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative term in itself]], as the characters (\u5308\u5974) have the meaning of \"fierce slave\".<ref name=yuuu86-384 /> (The Chinese characters are pronounced as ''Xi\u014dngn\u00fa'' {{IPAc-cmn|x|iong|1|n|u|2}} in modern [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]].)\n\nThere are several theories on the ethnolinguistic identity of the Xiongnu.\n\n=== Huns ===\n{{see also|Origin of the Huns}}\nThe sound of the first Chinese character (\u5308) in the name has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/q\u02b0o\u014b/}} in Old Chinese.<ref>Baxter-Sagart (2014).</ref> This sound has a possible similarity with the name \"[[Huns|Hun]]\" in European languages. The second character (\u5974) appears to have no parallel in Western terminology. Whether the similarity is evidence of kinship or mere coincidence is hard to tell. It could lend credence to the theory that the Huns were in fact descendants of the Northern Xiongnu who migrated westward, or that the Huns were using a name borrowed from the Northern Xiongnu, or that these Xiongnu made up part of the Hun confederation.\n\nThe Xiongnu-Hun hypothesis originated with the 18th-century French historian [[Joseph de Guignes]], who noticed that ancient Chinese scholars had referred to members of tribes associated with the Xiongnu by names similar to \"Hun\", albeit with varying Chinese characters. [[\u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re]] has shown that, in the [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian script]] used in the so-called \"[[Sogdian Ancient Letters]]\", both the Xiongnu and Huns were referred to as \u03b3wn (''xwn''), indicating that the two were synonymous.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vaissi\u00e8re|first=\u00c9tienne|title=Xiongnu|url=https://www.academia.edu/2455107|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica}}</ref> DNA testing of the remains of purported Huns has so far proved inconclusive in determining their origin.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Although the theory that the Xiongnu were precursors of the Huns known later in Europe is now accepted by many scholars, it has yet to become a consensus view. The identification with the Huns may be either incorrect or an oversimplification (as would appear to be the case with a [[Proto-Mongols|proto-Mongol]] people, the [[Rouran]], who have sometimes been linked to the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars of Central Europe]]).\n\n=== Iranian theories ===\n{{See also|Iranian languages}}\n[[Harold Walter Bailey]] proposed an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin of the Xiongnu, recognizing all the earliest Xiongnu names of the 2nd century BC as being of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] type.<ref name=\"Bailey21\" /> This theory is supported by [[Turkology|turkologist]] [[:pl:Henryk Jankowski (turkolog)|Henryk Jankowski]].<ref name=\"Jankowski26\" /> Central Asian scholar [[Christopher I.

From a Xiongnu tomb on the frontier, 4th\u20133rd century BC]]\n\n=== Artistic distinctions ===\n{{One source|section|date=December 2012}}\nWithin the Xiongnu culture more variety is visible from site to site than from \"era\" to \"era,\" in terms of the Chinese chronology, yet all form a whole that is distinct from that of the Han and other peoples of the non-Chinese north.<ref name=\"Psarras\">{{cite journal|last=Psarras|first=Sophia-Karin|title=Han and Xiongnu: A Reexamination of Cultural and Political Relations|journal=Monumenta Serica|year=2003|volume=51|pages=55\u2013236|jstor=40727370|doi=10.1080/02549948.2003.11731391}}</ref> In some instances iconography can not be used as the main cultural identifier because art depicting animal predation is common among the steppe peoples. An example of animal predation associated with Xiongnu culture is a tiger carrying dead prey.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> We see a similar image in work from Maoqinggou, a site which is presumed to have been under Xiongnu political control but is still clearly non-Xiongnu. From Maoqinggou, we see the prey replaced by an extension of the tiger's foot. The work also depicts a lower level of execution; Maoqinggou work was executed in a rounder, less detailed style.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> In its broadest sense, Xiongnu iconography of animal predation include examples such as the gold headdress from Aluchaideng and gold earrings with a turquoise and jade inlay discovered in Xigouban, Inner Mongolia.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The gold headdress can be viewed, along with some other examples of Xiongnu art, from the external links at the bottom of this article.\n\nXiongnu art is harder to distinguish from [[Saka]] or [[Scythian art]]. There was a similarity present in stylistic execution, but Xiongnu art and Saka art did often differ in terms of iconography. Saka art does not appear to have included predation scenes, especially with dead prey, or same-animal combat. Additionally, Saka art included elements not common to Xiongnu iconography, such as a winged, horned horse.<ref name=\"Psarras\" /> The two cultures also used two different bird heads. Xiongnu depictions of birds have a tendency to have a moderate eye and beak and have ears, while Saka birds have a pronounced eye and beak and no ears.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}} Some scholars{{who|date=November 2014}} claim these differences are indicative of cultural differences. Scholar Sophia-Karin Psarras claims that Xiongnu images of animal predation, specifically tiger plus prey, is spiritual, representative of death and rebirth, and same-animal combat is representative of the acquisition of or maintenance of power.<ref name=\"Psarras\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}}\n\n=== Rock art and writing ===\nThe rock art of the [[Yin Mountains|Yin]] and [[Helan Mountains]] is dated from the 9th millennium BC to the 19th century AD. It consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and only minimally of painted images.<ref>Dematt\u00e8 2006</ref>\n\nExcavations conducted between 1924 and 1925 in the Noin-Ula kurgans produced objects with over twenty carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to that of to the runic letters of the [[Old Turkic alphabet]] discovered in the [[Orkhon Valley]]. From this a some scholars hold that the Xiongnu had a script similar to Eurasian runiform and this alphabet itself served as the basis for the ancient Turkic writing.<ref>Ishjamts 1996: 166</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (vol. [[:zh:s:\u53f2\u8a18/\u5377110|110]]) state that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood; they also mention a \"Hu script\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Fig6Ishjamts p166R1.gif|2nd century BCE \u2013 2nd century CE characters of Hun-[[Xianbei]] script (Mongolia and Inner Mongolia), N.

From their lifestyle of herding flocks and their horse-trade with China, it can be concluded that their diet consist mainly of [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], [[horse meat]] and wild geese that were shot down.\n\n== Possible connection to Korean Silla Dynasty ==\nIn various kinds of ancient inscriptions on monuments of [[Munmu of Silla]], it is recorded that King Munmu possibly came from an unknown Xiongnu-tribe or that he has partially Xiongnu ancestry. According to several historians, it is possible that this unknown tribe was originally of [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] origin and joined the Xiongnu confederation. Later the tribes ruling family returned to Korea and married into the royal family of Silla. There are also some Korean researchers that point out that the grave goods of Silla and of the eastern Xiongnu are alike.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Cho Gab-je|date= |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\u9a0e\u99ac\ud749\ub178\uad6d\uac00 \u65b0\u7f85 \uc5f0\uad6c\u3000\u8d99\u7532\u6fdf(\u6708\u520a\u671d\u9bae \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc7a5)\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35\ucde8\uc7ac\u3000\ub0b4 \ubab8\uc18d\uc744 \ud750\ub974\ub294 \ud749\ub178\uc758 \ud53c|publisher=[[Monthly Chosun]]|url=http://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?nNewsNumb=200403100027&ctcd=&cpage=1|accessdate=2016-09-25|author-link= Cho Gab-je}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=\uae40\uc6b4\ud68c|date=2005-08-30 |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\uae40\uc6b4\ud68c\uc758 '\ub300\uc96c\uc2e0\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544\uc11c' <23> \uae08\uad00\uc758 \ub098\ub77c, \uc2e0\ub77c\u201d|publisher=\ud504\ub808\uc2dc\uc548|url=http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=40050830181724&Section=04|accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=|date=2009-02-27 |language=ko-kr |script-title=ko:\uacbd\uc8fc \uc0ac\ucc9c\uc655\uc0ac(\u5bfa) \uc0ac\ucc9c\uc655\uc0c1(\u56db\u5929\u738b\u50cf) \uc65c 4\uac1c\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c 3\uac1c\uc77c\uae4c|publisher=\uc870\uc120\uc77c\ubcf4|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/26/2009022601873.html|accessdate=2016-09-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230090440/http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/02/26/2009022601873.html|archivedate=2014-12-30}}</ref><ref>\uae40\ucc3d\ud638, \u3008\ubb38\ubb34\uc655\ub989\ube44\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \uc870\uc0c1\uc778\uc2dd \u2013 \ud0dc\uc870\uc131\ud55c\uc758 \ucca8\ubcf4 -\u3009, \u300a\ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\uc5f0\uad6c\u300b, \ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\uc5f0\uad6c\ud68c, 1986\ub144</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nl.go.kr/nl/search/SearchDetail.nl?category_code=ct&service=KOLIS&vdkvgwkey=14167918&colltype=YON_ART&place_code_info=132&place_name_info=%EC%97%B0%EC%86%8D%EA%B0%84%ED%96%89%EB%AC%BC%EC%8B%A4(3%EC%B8%B5)&manage_code=MA&shape_code=B&refLoc=portal&category=storage&srchFlag=Y&h_kwd=%E6%96%B0%E7%BE%85%E5%BB%BA%E5%9C%8B%E8%A8%AD%E8%A9%B1%EC%9D%98+%E7%A1%8F%E7%A9%B6%7C4%E8%BC%AF(1972%EB%85%84+5%EC%9B%94),+p.+1-52|title=\uc790\ub8cc\uac80\uc0c9>\uc0c1\uc138_\uae30\uc0ac {{!}} \uad6d\ub9bd\uc911\uc559\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00|website=www.nl.go.kr|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Chanyu#List of Xiongnu Chanyus|List of Xiongnu rulers (Chanyus)]]\n* [[Chanyu#Chanyu family trees|Rulers family tree]]\n* [[Nomadic empire]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[History of the Han Dynasty]]\n* [[Ban Yong]]\n* [[Zubu]]\n* [[List of largest empires]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Primary sources\n* [[Ban Gu]] et al., ''[[Book of Han]]'', esp. vol. 94, [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377094\u4e0a|part 1]], [[:zh:s:\u6f22\u66f8/\u5377094\u4e0b|part 2]].\n* [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] et al., ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', esp.

The infectious agent responsible for the disease is '''rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus''' ('''RHDV'''), or '''rabbit calicivirus''' ('''RCV'''), genus ''[[Lagovirus]]'' of the family [[Caliciviridae]]. The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control rabbit populations.\n\n== RHDV1 and RHDV2 ==\n\nRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a single strand RNA virus in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae. In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=P. J. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Holmes |first3=E. C. |title=Origin and Phylodynamics of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus |journal=Journal of Virology |date=16 September 2009 |volume=83 |issue=23 |pages=12129\u201312138 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01523-09|doi-access=free }}</ref> all of which are highly pathogenic. In addition, non-pathogenic rabbit caliciviruses related to but distinct from RHDV have been identified in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capucci |first1=L. |last2=Fusi |first2=P. |last3=Lavazza |first3=A. |last4=Pacciarini |first4=M.L. |last5=Rossi |first5=C. |title=Detection and preliminary characterization of a new rabbit calicivirus related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus but nonpathogenic |journal=Journal of Virology |date=December 1996 |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=8614-8623}}</ref>\n\nThe two strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease currently of medical significance are RHDV1 and RHDV2. RHDV1 (sometimes referred to simply as RHDV, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV1 in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nRHDV2 first appeared in France in 2010, from which it spread to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, and Australia. This strain affects multiple lagomorph species, including ''Sylvilagus spp.'' (cottontail rabbits) and ''Lepus spp.'' (hares). It can also cause disease in young rabbits. RHDV2 appears to be replacing the RHDV1 strain in Australia. The 2019 and 2020 outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Washington state and Vancouver were caused by RHDV2. The 2020 outbreak of RHDV2 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is affecting wild cottontails and hares as well as domestic European rabbits; since the virus has now spread into the wild rabbit populations, containment is unlikely.\n\nRHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV1 that the two have different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Both viruses appear to spread via direct contact, fomites, biting insects (mechanical vectors only), and inhalation.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV1 first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]]. It was first isolated and characterized by S.J. Liu ''et al''. in 1984.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | title = A New Viral Disease of Rabbit| work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171330.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-17 }}</ref> The Chinese outbreak was spread by the [[angora rabbit]], which had originated in [[Europe]].

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Cases of viral transmission to domesticated pet rabbits have been confirmed and vaccinating rabbits has been recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evira.fi/elaimet/elainlaakaripalvelut/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille/2016/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille-elokuu-2016/rhd-tauti-todettu-myos-lemmikkikaniinissa-erityisluvallista-rokotetta-saatavilla/|title=RHD-tauti todettu my\u00f6s lemmikkikaniinissa - erityisluvallista rokotetta saatavilla|website=Finnish Food Safety Authority (Finnish)|access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nTransmission of RHD occurs by direct contact with an infected animal and [[fomite]]s. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

RHDV1 (sometimes referred to simply as RHDV, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus'').

There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV1 in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nRHDV2 first appeared in France in 2010, from which it spread to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, and Australia. This strain affects multiple lagomorph species, including ''Sylvilagus spp.'' (cottontail rabbits) and ''Lepus spp.'' (hares). It can also cause disease in young rabbits. RHDV2 appears to be replacing the RHDV1 strain in Australia. The 2019 and 2020 outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Washington state and Vancouver were caused by RHDV2. The 2020 outbreak of RHDV2 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is affecting wild cottontails and hares as well as domestic European rabbits; since the virus has now spread into the wild rabbit populations, containment is unlikely.\n\nRHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV1 that the two have different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Both viruses appear to spread via direct contact, fomites, biting insects (mechanical vectors only), and inhalation.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV1 first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]].

However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Cases of viral transmission to domesticated pet rabbits have been confirmed and vaccinating rabbits has been recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evira.fi/elaimet/elainlaakaripalvelut/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille/2016/saparo-uutiskirje-elainlaakareille-elokuu-2016/rhd-tauti-todettu-myos-lemmikkikaniinissa-erityisluvallista-rokotetta-saatavilla/|title=RHD-tauti todettu my\u00f6s lemmikkikaniinissa - erityisluvallista rokotetta saatavilla|website=Finnish Food Safety Authority (Finnish)|access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Transmission ==\nTransmission of RHD occurs by direct contact with an infected animal and [[fomite]]s. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

The operation included an attack on the headquarters of [[Erwin Rommel]], the commander of {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Afrika]]}} in [[North Africa]]. It was timed for the night of 17/18 November 1941, just before the start of [[Operation Crusader]]. The operation failed as Rommel had left the target house weeks earlier and all but two of the commandos who landed were killed or captured. One member of the [[Special Boat Section]] team, who had secured the beach for the commando party, also escaped.\n\n==Planning==\nFrom October to November 1941, a plan was formulated at [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] headquarters to attack: (data from Jones 2006 unless indicated){{sfn|Jones|2006|p=197}}\n* Rommel's presumed headquarters near [[Bayda, Libya|Beda Littoria]], some {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland from [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]], Libya\n* a wireless station and intelligence centre at Apollonia\n* an Italian headquarters and communications cable mast at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]\n* the headquarters of the Italian [[Trieste Division]] near [[Slonta]]\n\nAlthough not specified in the orders, the goal of the raid was to kill or capture Rommel, to disrupt German organisation before the start of Crusader. Rommel's headquarters was believed to be at Beda Littoria, because Captain John Haselden had reconnoitred the area disguised as an Arab and reported that Rommel's staff car came and went from the former [[Prefecture]]. The operation was led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Robert Laycock]]; Lieutenant-Colonel [[Geoffrey Charles Tasker Keyes|Geoffrey Keyes]], present throughout the planning stage, selected the most hazardous task of the attack on Rommel's headquarters for himself. Unbeknownst to the planners, Beda Littoria had only briefly been Rommel's headquarters and had been taken over by the chief quartermaster of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Afrika}}, General Schleusener. Some weeks earlier, Rommel had moved his headquarters nearer to [[Tobruk]] to be close to the action. Rommel was not even in North Africa during Flipper, having gone to Rome to request replacements for supply ships sunk by the British.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=110}}\n\n==Raid==\n[[File:HMS Torbay.jpg|thumb|Submarine HMS ''Torbay'']]\nOn 10 November, {{HMS|Torbay|N79|6}} carried Keyes, Captain Robin Campbell, Lieutenant Roy Cooke and 25 men. {{HMS|Talisman|N78|6}} transported Laycock, Captain Glennie, Lieutenant Sutherland and 25 men from [[Alexandria]]. On the night of 14/15 November 1941, Keyes' detachment landed on the beach of {{lang|ar|Khashm al-Kalb}} (The Dog's Nose), guided by two-man Special Boat Section (SBS) teams in folbots (folding canoes).{{sfn|Pitt|2001|p=39}} The beach lay near a place known as Hamama, some {{convert|250|miles|km|abbr=on}} behind Axis lines. Once ashore, they made contact with Haselden, delivered earlier by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] for reconnaissance. The weather deteriorated and Laycock's group had a much more difficult time getting ashore. Laycock and seven men landed but the rest were stranded on ''Talisman''. With only 34 of the 59 men available, instead of four detachments attacking the targets, there were only to be three.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=198}} Laycock remained at the rendezvous with three men to secure the beach, Keyes led his detachment of 25 men for the attack on Rommel's supposed headquarters, while Lieutenant Cooke took six men to destroy the communications facilities near Cyrene. Haselden's detachment completed its mission and was picked up by the LRDG.\n\nShortly before first light, Keyes' men moved to a [[wadi]], where they sheltered until dark on the second night then moved off. Their Arab guide refused to accompany the party in the deteriorating weather. Keyes then led his men on a {{convert|1800|ft|m|abbr=on}} climb, followed by an approach march of {{convert|18|miles|km|abbr=on}} in pitch dark and torrential rain. Hiding in a cave during the day, the detachment advanced to within a few hundred yards of the objective by 22:00 on the third night. At 23:59, Keyes led his party past sentries and other defences up to the house. Unable to find an open window or door, Keyes took advantage of Campbell's excellent German by having him pound on the front door and demand entrance. They set upon the sentry who opened the door. Campbell shot him and Keyes might have been wounded in the scuffle. The official version is that Keyes opened the door to a nearby room, found Germans inside, closed it again abruptly, reopened it to hurl in a grenade and was shot by one of the Germans. Only one round was fired by the Germans during the raid on the HQ.{{sfn|Asher|2004|p=243}}\n\nKeyes was taken outside but quickly died; shortly afterwards, Campbell, having forgotten his orders to shoot on sight, was shot in the leg by one of his men. He passed command to Sergeant Jack Terry and remained behind. Terry gathered the raiding team and retreated with 17 men to rejoin Laycock at the beach. An Italian source, not explicit in naming the British names, points that Cooke's men encountered a platoon of Italian police paratroopers. The Italians had been searching for the British raiders close to the village Mansura (about {{cvt|15|km|miles|0|order=flip}} north of Cyrene).\n\nAccording to the source, 2nd lieutenant Alfredo Sandulli Mercuro and the 3rd Platoon, 2nd Company, 1\u00b0 {{lang|it|Battaglione Paracadutisti Carabinieri Reali}} encountered what he thought was a band of Arabs hiding along a mountain ridge on 19 November 1941. When called upon by Mercuro's Arab interpreter, the Italians were fired on and the paratroopers engaged what they now knew were British commandos, who withdrew to a cave. With no way out, the wounded commandos surrendered after Mercuro threatened to use [[flamethrower|flamethrowers]] on them. The paratroops took prisoner a group consisting of an officer, one NCO and three other ranks. Except for the officer, all the British were wounded and received medical treatment from the Italians. Mercuro searched the cave and found small arms and three demolition charges. The Italians suffered three wounded during the fight.{{sfn|Cursi|2014|p=75}}\n\nIt proved impossible for the Laycock party to re-embark on the submarines and they waited for the weather to improve. They were discovered and exchanged fire with local Italian gendarmes (and German troops by some accounts). Aware that they could not hope to stand off the large force that was surely being organised, Laycock ordered the men to scatter. Laycock and Terry made it to safety after 37 days in the desert and Bombardier John Brittlebank, one of the SBS team who had guided the commandos in the folbots, escaped and survived alone in the desert for forty days until picked up by Allied troops. The rest of the raiding force was captured, some of them wounded. Contrary to some reports, only Keyes was killed by the Germans; one man drowned during the landing.\n\n==Nominal roll==\n(Reconstructed by Michael Asher (2004), based on a list by Hans Edelmaier, amended from documentary and witness evidence, with the assistance of the Commando Association [now defunct].

An emergency signal was sent to Middle East Command but was too late to stop the operation. On 15 November, a decrypt of an Italian C 38m machine cipher had revealed that the Italians knew from divers sources that a British landing was imminent near Apollonia.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=188}}\n\nThe German historian Hans Edelmaier suggests that Rommel was not the objective of the raid and his name not featuring in the plan supports this. There is no proof that Hasleden reported Rommel's presence at the house in Beda and it has never been explained how Rommel was to be found or recognised by the commando unit.{{sfn|Edelmaier|2000|p=}}{{page needed|date=August 2017}} The only extant evidence that Rommel was the object of the raid came from a witness, Gunner Jim Gornall, who related that Keyes briefed the men on board the ''Torbay'' that their objective was to \"get Rommel\".{{sfn|Asher|2004|p=166}} When news of the raid reached him, Rommel was said to be indignant that the British should believe his headquarters was {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the front; Rommel preferred to be near the front line with his troops.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=110}}{{efn|An article in the Scottish Daily Express (Thursday July 9, 1942) titled ''Up Rommel's H.Q.'' describes the story relayed by repatriated New Zealanders of 23 survivors of the raid interned in Italy. Sergeant Charles Nicol of Aberdeen, Sergeant Charles Bruce of Brechin Angus and Bombardier D. Brodie of Ballinluig Perthshire were named. They and other Commandos told the New Zealanders that they had been taken up the coast in a submarine. They were at first unable to land at their destination because of storm but on the following night they set off in rubber boats, one of which capsized. Some of the men swam ashore in life-belts. Sergeant Bruce was nearly drowned but was dragged out by Sergeant Nicol. On the beach, which was swept by a gale, they were met by an intelligence officer who was dressed as a desert nomad. He guided them to Rommel's headquarters. They travelled two days. On the final stage a thunderstorm soaked their bomb fuses. While shooting up Rommel's house Bombardier Brodie blew up the generator with bombs. Bad weather prevented the survivors from getting away by sea. Sergeant Charles Bruce, a 41-year-old Brechin man, went to Australia when he was 21. He was working on a farm there when war broke out. He tried to enlist but without success. So he came home, volunteered and joined an Army unit in December 1939, transferring to the Commandos more than a year later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nThe British suffered two men killed, 28 captured (three wounded) and three men escaped; German casualties were four killed and three wounded. Keyes' body and those of the four dead Germans were buried with [[military honours]] on Rommel's orders in a local Catholic cemetery.{{sfn|Mortimer|2014|p=64}} For his actions Keyes was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. The citation for the award was written by Robert Laycock, who contrary to British military custom, was not a witness to Keyes' actions on the night in which he was killed.

The operation included an attack on the headquarters of [[Erwin Rommel]], the commander of {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Afrika]]}} in [[North Africa]]. It was timed for the night of 17/18 November 1941, just before the start of [[Operation Crusader]]. The operation failed as Rommel had left the target house weeks earlier and all but two of the commandos who landed were killed or captured. One member of the [[Special Boat Section]] team, who had secured the beach for the commando party, also escaped.\n\n==Planning==\nFrom October to November 1941, a plan was formulated at [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] headquarters to attack: (data from Jones 2006 unless indicated){{sfn|Jones|2006|p=197}}\n* Rommel's presumed headquarters near [[Bayda, Libya|Beda Littoria]], some {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland from [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]], Libya\n* a wireless station and intelligence centre at Apollonia\n* an Italian headquarters and communications cable mast at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]\n* the headquarters of the Italian [[Trieste Division]] near [[Slonta]]\n\nAlthough not specified in the orders, the goal of the raid was to kill or capture Rommel, to disrupt German organisation before the start of Crusader. Rommel's headquarters was believed to be at Beda Littoria, because Captain John Haselden had reconnoitred the area disguised as an Arab and reported that Rommel's staff car came and went from the former [[Prefecture]]. The operation was led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Robert Laycock]]; Lieutenant-Colonel [[Geoffrey Charles Tasker Keyes|Geoffrey Keyes]], present throughout the planning stage, selected the most hazardous task of the attack on Rommel's headquarters for himself. Unbeknownst to the planners, Beda Littoria had only briefly been Rommel's headquarters and had been taken over by the chief quartermaster of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Afrika}}, General Schleusener. Some weeks earlier, Rommel had moved his headquarters nearer to [[Tobruk]] to be close to the action. Rommel was not even in North Africa during Flipper, having gone to Rome to request replacements for supply ships sunk by the British.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=110}}\n\n==Raid==\n[[File:HMS Torbay.jpg|thumb|Submarine HMS ''Torbay'']]\nOn 10 November, {{HMS|Torbay|N79|6}} carried Keyes, Captain Robin Campbell, Lieutenant Roy Cooke and 25 men. {{HMS|Talisman|N78|6}} transported Laycock, Captain Glennie, Lieutenant Sutherland and 25 men from [[Alexandria]]. On the night of 14/15 November 1941, Keyes' detachment landed on the beach of {{lang|ar|Khashm al-Kalb}} (The Dog's Nose), guided by two-man Special Boat Section (SBS) teams in folbots (folding canoes).{{sfn|Pitt|2001|p=39}} The beach lay near a place known as Hamama, some {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind Axis lines. Once ashore, they made contact with Haselden, delivered earlier by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] for reconnaissance. The weather deteriorated and Laycock's group had a much more difficult time getting ashore. Laycock and seven men landed but the rest were stranded on ''Talisman''. With only 34 of the 59 men available, instead of four detachments attacking the targets, there were only to be three.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=198}} Laycock remained at the rendezvous with three men to secure the beach, Keyes led his detachment of 25 men for the attack on Rommel's supposed headquarters, while Lieutenant Cooke took six men to destroy the communications facilities near Cyrene. Haselden's detachment completed its mission and was picked up by the LRDG.\n\nShortly before first light, Keyes' men moved to a [[wadi]], where they sheltered until dark on the second night then moved off. Their Arab guide refused to accompany the party in the deteriorating weather. Keyes then led his men on a {{convert|1800|ft|m|abbr=on}} climb, followed by an approach march of {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} in pitch dark and torrential rain. Hiding in a cave during the day, the detachment advanced to within a few hundred yards of the objective by 22:00 on the third night. At 23:59, Keyes led his party past sentries and other defences up to the house. Unable to find an open window or door, Keyes took advantage of Campbell's excellent German by having him pound on the front door and demand entrance. They set upon the sentry who opened the door. Campbell shot him and Keyes might have been wounded in the scuffle. The official version is that Keyes opened the door to a nearby room, found Germans inside, closed it again abruptly, reopened it to hurl in a grenade and was shot by one of the Germans. Only one round was fired by the Germans during the raid on the HQ.{{sfn|Asher|2004|p=243}}\n\nKeyes was taken outside but quickly died; shortly afterwards, Campbell, having forgotten his orders to shoot on sight, was shot in the leg by one of his men. He passed command to Sergeant Jack Terry and remained behind. Terry gathered the raiding team and retreated with 17 men to rejoin Laycock at the beach. An Italian source, not explicit in naming the British names, points that Cooke's men encountered a platoon of Italian police paratroopers. The Italians had been searching for the British raiders close to the village Mansura (about {{cvt|15|km|mi|0|order=flip}} north of Cyrene).\n\nAccording to the source, 2nd lieutenant Alfredo Sandulli Mercuro and the 3rd Platoon, 2nd Company, 1\u00b0 {{lang|it|Battaglione Paracadutisti Carabinieri Reali}} encountered what he thought was a band of Arabs hiding along a mountain ridge on 19 November 1941. When called upon by Mercuro's Arab interpreter, the Italians were fired on and the paratroopers engaged what they now knew were British commandos, who withdrew to a cave. With no way out, the wounded commandos surrendered after Mercuro threatened to use flamethrowers on them. The paratroops took prisoner a group consisting of an officer, one NCO and three other ranks. Except for the officer, all the British were wounded and received medical treatment from the Italians. Mercuro searched the cave and found small arms and three demolition charges. The Italians suffered three wounded during the fight.{{sfn|Cursi|2014|p=75}}\n\nIt proved impossible for the Laycock party to re-embark on the submarines and they waited for the weather to improve. They were discovered and exchanged fire with local Italian gendarmes (and German troops by some accounts). Aware that they could not hope to stand off the large force that was surely being organised, Laycock ordered the men to scatter. Laycock and Terry made it to safety after 37 days in the desert and Bombardier John Brittlebank, one of the SBS team who had guided the commandos in the folbots, escaped and survived alone in the desert for forty days until picked up by Allied troops. The rest of the raiding force was captured, some of them wounded. Contrary to some reports, only Keyes was killed by the Germans; one man drowned during the landing.\n\n==Nominal roll==\n(Reconstructed by Michael Asher (2004), based on a list by Hans Edelmaier, amended from documentary and witness evidence, with the assistance of the Commando Association [now defunct].

An emergency signal was sent to Middle East Command but was too late to stop the operation. On 15 November, a decrypt of an Italian C 38m machine cipher had revealed that the Italians knew from divers sources that a British landing was imminent near Apollonia.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=188}}\n\nThe German historian Hans Edelmaier suggests that Rommel was not the objective of the raid and his name not featuring in the plan supports this. There is no proof that Hasleden reported Rommel's presence at the house in Beda and it has never been explained how Rommel was to be found or recognised by the commando unit.{{sfn|Edelmaier|2000|p=}}{{page needed|date=August 2017}} The only extant evidence that Rommel was the object of the raid came from a witness, Gunner Jim Gornall, who related that Keyes briefed the men on board the ''Torbay'' that their objective was to \"get Rommel\".{{sfn|Asher|2004|p=166}} When news of the raid reached him, Rommel was said to be indignant that the British should believe his headquarters was {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the front; Rommel preferred to be near the front line with his troops.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=110}}{{efn|An article in the Scottish Daily Express (Thursday July 9, 1942) titled ''Up Rommel's H.Q.'' describes the story relayed by repatriated New Zealanders of 23 survivors of the raid interned in Italy. Sergeant Charles Nicol of Aberdeen, Sergeant Charles Bruce of Brechin Angus and Bombardier D. Brodie of Ballinluig Perthshire were named. They and other Commandos told the New Zealanders that they had been taken up the coast in a submarine. They were at first unable to land at their destination because of storm but on the following night they set off in rubber boats, one of which capsized. Some of the men swam ashore in life-belts. Sergeant Bruce was nearly drowned but was dragged out by Sergeant Nicol. On the beach, which was swept by a gale, they were met by an intelligence officer who was dressed as a desert nomad. He guided them to Rommel's headquarters. They travelled two days. On the final stage a thunderstorm soaked their bomb fuses. While shooting up Rommel's house Bombardier Brodie blew up the generator with bombs. Bad weather prevented the survivors from getting away by sea. Sergeant Charles Bruce, a 41-year-old Brechin man, went to Australia when he was 21. He was working on a farm there when war broke out. He tried to enlist but without success. So he came home, volunteered and joined an Army unit in December 1939, transferring to the Commandos more than a year later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nThe British suffered two men killed, 28 captured (three wounded) and three men escaped; German casualties were four killed and three wounded. Keyes' body and those of the four dead Germans were buried with [[military honours]] on Rommel's orders in a local Catholic cemetery.{{sfn|Mortimer|2014|p=64}} For his actions Keyes was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. The citation for the award was written by Robert Laycock, who contrary to British military custom, was not a witness to Keyes' actions on the night in which he was killed.

The cathedral city is [[Kristiansand]], Norway's fifth largest city. [[Kristiansand Cathedral]] serves as the seat of the presiding Bishop. The bishop since 2013 has been [[Stein Reinertsen]].  As of 1 January 2003, there were 347,324 members of the Church of Norway in the diocese.\n\n==History==\nIn 1125, the southern part of the [[Ancient Diocese of Bergen]] was split off as the [[Ancient Diocese of Stavanger]]. This new diocese stretched from the coast of [[Haugesund]] in the west to [[Gjernestangen]] between [[Ris\u00f8r]] and [[Krager\u00f8]], later the border stretched to [[Eidanger]] in the east. [[Stavanger]] was the [[cathedral]] city.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], Norway became a Lutheran nation, establishing the [[Church of Norway]].  The diocesan boundaries remained the same.\n\nOver time, however, the diocese was reduced in size.  The parish of Eidfjord was transferred to the neighboring [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] in 1630.

The Diocese of Agder continued to serve the counties of [[Aust-Agder]], [[Vest-Agder]], and [[Telemark]], although its name \"Diocese of Agder\" continued to be used until 2005 when the name \"Telemark\" was added to fully reflect the areas included in the diocese.<ref name=\"snl\" />\n\n==Kristiansand Cathedral==\n{{main|Kristiansand Cathedral}}\n[[Kristiansand Cathedral]] is the headquarters of the Diocese of Agder and Telemark and it is the main parish church for the city of [[Kristiansand]].
