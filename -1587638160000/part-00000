The tender for the then-new franchise in 2015 originally permitted the continued use of Pacer trains, as it was judged by the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) that a new rolling stock order represented \"''poor value for money.''\".<ref>{{cite web |title=McLoughlin overrules officials who called Pacer replacement 'poor value' |url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/mcloughlin-overrules-officials-who-called-pacer-replacement-poor-value-for-money |work=Rail Technology Magazine |date=27 February 2015}}</ref> However the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Transport Select Committee]] described the continued use of ''Pacer'' trains as \"''unacceptable''\" and recommended that the [[Secretary of State for Transport|Secretary of State]] use franchise specification power to include the need for a new rolling stock order.<ref>{{cite web |title=Proposals to withdraw Pacer trains by 2020 |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/news/pacer-trains/ |work=House of Commons |date=27 February 2015}}</ref> Subsequently, the then Secretary of State for Transport [[Patrick McLoughlin]] issued a [[Ministerial order|ministerial directive]] in February 2015 to force the new franchise to include a new rolling stock order as part of the franchise agreement, which would enable the ''Pacer'' trains to be phased out.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pacer vehicles withdrawal: confirming the ministerial direction |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pacer-vehicles-withdrawal-confirming-the-ministerial-direction |work=gov.uk |date=27 February 2015 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of the new trains was made by now-previous operator Arriva UK Trains when it was confirmed that it would become the next operator of the Northern franchise (after Serco-Abellio) from 1 April 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.arrivarailnorth.org/keeping-you-posted/9-test-news-article-2 |title= Intention to award Northern franchise to Arriva |publisher= Arriva Rail North |access-date= 22 March 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160317020324/http://www.arrivarailnorth.org/keeping-you-posted/9-test-news-article-2 |archive-date= 17 March 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The Class 195 order was based on Arriva's belief that the ageing and dilapidated state of rolling stock in Northern England was an inherent obstacle to enticing new passengers - particularly those in cars - and that investing in new modern trains represented the best long-term strategy for enabling passenger growth.<ref name=\"engineer\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Northern's new trains set to trigger fleet rejuvenation |quote=However, Northern believes that withdrawal of the Pacers by the end of next year means attention will then turn to the quality of the remaining trains.

Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system.

The move, which Erdo\u011fan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=19 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places.

Within his [[Virtue Party]], there was a dispute about the appropriate discourse of the party between traditional politicians and pro-reform politicians. The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like [[National Order Party]], [[National Salvation Party]] and [[Welfare Party]]. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary [[conservatism|conservative party]] following the example of the European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.\n\nWhen the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of [[Necmettin Erbakan]] founded the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) and the reformers founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) under the leadership of [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] and Erdo\u011fan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like [[Ali Babacan]] and [[Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu]]), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program.

Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system.

The move, which Erdo\u011fan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=19 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places.

He defined the thought process, and how it reaches the status of conviction or concepts. He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the ''Nafs'' (emotions and sentiments). Delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions, and the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in London South Bank University's information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is through discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in Muslims' mental, emotional and conceptual lives led to the decline of Muslim culture and the eventual destruction of the Caliphate. He believed the first major step in the decline of Muslim culture was confusion about and conflict with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued that the Islamic world did not know how to tackle and contextualize these ideas because they became insular and complacent instead of preserving Islamic thought and philosophy and keeping it relevant to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed that Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after ''Aqeeda'' (belief) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]), but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book [4], contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n'''Kamal al-Din al-Nabhani''' (January 3, 1929 \u2013 December 31, 2006) was one of the founders of the [[Islamist]] political party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and was a son of Sheikh [[Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani]].\n\n== Early Life ==\nKamal al-Din al-Nabhani was born on January 3, 1929, in [[Beirut, Lebanon]].\n\n== Thought ==\n\n=== Philosophy and Theology ===\nIn his books 'Thought' and 'System of Islam 2' (based on the work of his father [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]]), Nabhani placed heavy emphasis on discussing modes and models of the psychology behind human thought and concepts.
