Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

Un Nom Encens (L\u2019Harmattan, 1999). G. follows Maimonides\u2019 teaching that that YHWH \u201cis read as it is written,\u201d i.e., yehua, in the same way that yhwdh is vocalized yehuda\u2014applying the (coincidentally correct) Masoretic vowels. G. first considers biblical treatment of \u201cthe name\u201d: the power of the name; to know God\u2019s name; Jesus, Satan, the controversy over the name; and \u201cthe name read distinctly\u201d (reconstruction of the reading).

Gilligan states: \"because God is wondrous and mighty\u2014an object of awe\u2014the name of God would also be wondrous and mighty, intended to be spoken or sung with reverence. In a biblical culture, the name of God would express God\u2019s majesty and power\" and adds: \"to put it in other terms, a biblical name (in a sense) was an alter ego; it represented the person. To know someone\u2019s name was to know who and what the person was: not only his or her character or qualities, but especially his or her power, role, or function\u2014what the individual was empowered to do. To be without a name was to be worthless, of no importance.\"<ref name=Gilligan/>\n\n==== Some comments of his thesis ====\nE. J. Revell (Professor emeritus at the [[University of Toronto]]) claim: I was very interested to read the copy of your work which you sent me. Before reading your study, had no particular opinion on the pronunciation of the name of God. As a student in the 50\u2019s, I was told that scholars have determined that \u201cYahweh\u201d was the ancient pronunciation. I did not find the argument wellgrounded, but the view was held almost as an article of faith by my instructors, and I had no superior argument, so I ignored the problem. I have occasionally thought about it since, but I have not acquired any information that you have not noticed in your study.

Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

As a student in the 50\u2019s, I was told that scholars have determined that \u201cYahweh\u201d was the ancient pronunciation. I did not find the argument wellgrounded, but the view was held almost as an article of faith by my instructors, and I had no superior argument, so I ignored the problem. I have occasionally thought about it since, but I have not acquired any information that you have not noticed in your study.

{"title_page": "Colorado Silver Boom", "text_new": "[[File:Matchless Mine.JPG|thumb|300px|The Matchless Mine in Leadville, originally owned by [[Horace Tabor]], known as \"The Silver King\".]]\n\nThe '''Colorado Silver Boom''' was a dramatic expansionist period of [[silver]] [[mining]] activity in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]] in the late 19th century. The boom started in 1879 with the discovery of silver at [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]]. Over 82 million dollars worth of silver was mined during the period, making it the second great mineral boom in the state, and coming twenty years after the earlier and shorter [[Colorado Gold Rush]] of 1859.  The boom was largely the consequence of large-scale purchases of silver by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1878. The boom endured throughout the 1880s, resulting in an intense increase in both the population and wealth of Colorado, especially in the mountains. It came to an end in 1893 in the wake of the collapse of silver prices caused by the repeal of [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]].<ref name=Voynick>Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0878424555}}</ref>{{rp|61\u201362}}\n\nSilver had been discovered in Colorado in the 1860s, with early mining in [[Clear Creek Canyon]] at [[Georgetown, Colorado|Georgetown]] in 1864. In the early days, the mineral was overshadowed by gold, however, and the low price of mineral meant that most mines were not profitable enough to operate. In 1878, responding to pressure from western interests, the United States Congress passed the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] authorizing the free coinage of silver. The government demand raised the price of the metal to the point where many additional mines were profitable. The discovery of the Leadville district the following year resulted in a flood of new emigrant prospectors to many of the same mountain gullies that had been the site of the gold rush. The resulting opulence was most lavish in Leadville itself.  The repeal of the Sherman Act in 1893 conversely led to a collapse of silver prices, bringing out an end to the boom as well.\n\n[[File:Creede, Bachelor Loop mine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old mine in Creede, Colorado]]\n\nBeginning in 1889, [[Creede, Colorado]] was the site of another big silver boom.\nThe first discovery was made at the Alpha mine in 1869, but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores. The great \u201cBoom Days\u201d started with the discovery of rich minerals in Willow Creek Canyon. The town leapt from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891. The mines operated continuously until 1995.

The boom also drove many extensions of the railway network in the mountains, including such lines as the [[Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad|Denver, South Park and Pacific]], which built an early [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] line to Leadville. Likewise the extension of the railroad network up the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork Valley]] to the previously failed mining town of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in the late 1880s made the extraction of silver ore there economically feasible, and saved the town from near extinction.\n\nThe government purchases of silver were subsequently nearly doubled by the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act, further extending the boom into the early 1890s.  The repeal of the act in 1893 resulted in a collapse of silver prices, bringing about an end to the boom. After 1893, many mining camps became [[ghost town]]s. The accompanying collapse in statewide economic activity was ameliorated somewhat by the simultaneous emergence of agriculture, previously derided as not feasible, as a large component of the state economy.\n\nThe working conditions inside the mines were often very dangerous. [[Silicosis]]  which, at the time, was incurable, ruined miners' lungs quickly. Many other hazards existed. Apart from the lanterns or tallow candles the miners carried, the mines were otherwise completely dark. Miners at the time were also subject to the threat of tunnel collapse, flooding and the lack of oxygen in the deeper areas of the mines. Often the miners brought caged canaries down with them; when the bird passed out, it indicated that the oxygen levels were dangerously low in the area. Mines were commonly very small and tightly spaced to save on the cost, effort and time it would take to expand the tunnels, and so resulted in the use of people of smaller stature and even children.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Leadville Miners' Strike]]\n* [[Leadville mining district]]\n* [[Silver mining in Colorado]]\n* [[Gold mining in Colorado]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n*Carl Ubbelohde, Maxine Benson, and Duane A.

The repeal of the Sherman Act in 1893 conversely led to a collapse of silver prices, bringing out an end to the boom as well.\n\n[[File:Creede, Bachelor Loop mine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old mine in Creede, Colorado]]\n\nBeginning in 1889, [[Creede, Colorado]] was the site of another big silver boom.\nThe first discovery was made at the Alpha mine in 1869, but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores. The great \u201cBoom Days\u201d started with the discovery of rich minerals in Willow Creek Canyon. The town leapt from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891. The mines operated continuously until 1995.  Creede was the last silver boom town in Colorado in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams Jr.|first=Albert|title=Creede, A New Mining Camp|journal=The Engineering Magazine|volume=III|issue=3|pages=324\u2013339|publisher=McGraw Hill Publishing Co.|location=New York, NY|date=June 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkQAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA325#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Congress and Silver|journal=The Illustrated American|volume=X|issue=108|pages=158|date=March 12, 1893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwvnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA158#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Creede, the New Mining Town of Colorado|journal=Scientific American|volume=LXVI|issue=13|pages=196\u2013197|publisher=Munn & Co.|location=New York, NY|date=March 26, 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FdIxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA196#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Frank|title=History of the State of Colorado|publisher=The Blakely Printing Company|volume=IV|year=1895|location=Chicago, IL|pages=223\u2013225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZlQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA223#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Creede Is A Lively Town: Thousands Rush In For Sale Of Lands|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 27, 1892|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/02/27/106806911.pdf|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Creede, the New Mining Town of Colorado|journal=Scientific American|volume=LXVI|issue=13|pages=196\u2013197|publisher=Munn & Company|location=New York, NY|date=March 26, 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoU9AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA196#|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Creede|journal=The Colorado Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|pages=163\u2013172|publisher=The Colorado Publishing Co.|location=Denver, CO|date=May 1893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00NOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA163#|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Hall|editor-first= Henry|title=America's Successful Men of Affairs (entry for Nicholas C.

The boom also drove many extensions of the railway network in the mountains, including such lines as the [[Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad|Denver, South Park and Pacific]], which built an early [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] line to Leadville. Likewise the extension of the railroad network up the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork Valley]] to the previously failed mining town of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in the late 1880s made the extraction of silver ore there economically feasible, and saved the town from near extinction.\n\nThe government purchases of silver were subsequently nearly doubled by the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act, further extending the boom into the early 1890s.  The repeal of the act in 1893 resulted in a collapse of silver prices, bringing about an end to the boom. After 1893, many mining camps became [[ghost town]]s. The accompanying collapse in statewide economic activity was ameliorated somewhat by the simultaneous emergence of agriculture, previously derided as not feasible, as a large component of the state economy.\n\nThe working conditions inside the mines were often very dangerous. [[Silicosis]]  which, at the time, was incurable, ruined miners' lungs quickly. Many other hazards existed. Apart from the lanterns or tallow candles the miners carried, the mines were otherwise completely dark. Miners at the time were also subject to the threat of tunnel collapse, flooding and the lack of oxygen in the deeper areas of the mines. Often the miners brought caged canaries down with them; when the bird passed out, it indicated that the oxygen levels were dangerously low in the area. Mines were commonly very small and tightly spaced to save on the cost, effort and time it would take to expand the tunnels, and so resulted in the use of people of smaller stature and even children.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Leadville Miners' Strike]]\n* [[Leadville mining district]]\n* [[Silver mining in Colorado]]\n* [[Gold mining in Colorado]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n*Carl Ubbelohde, Maxine Benson, and Duane A.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

While she acknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not pleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know and love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and addition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment unfavourably to [[Patricia Rozema]]'s [[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|1999 adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, Sarah|title=How Not to Adapt \"Anne of Green Gables\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/how-not-to-adapt-anne-of-green-gables|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> For Joanna Robinson, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for Anne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled patriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into [[misogynists]], most notably the Reverend Allan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"''Anne with an E'' seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's continually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance needs no such clumsy opposition.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

When their neighbor Mrs. Lynde calls her homely, skinny and redhaired, she loses her temper.

It also seems to think that Anne needs a radical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist in its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that conflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop tragedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Joanna|title=The Depths of Despair: Anne of Green Gables: Netflix's Bleak Adaptation Gets It All So Terribly Wrong|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 12, 2017|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/anne-of-green-gables-netflix-review-anne-with-an-e-bleak-sad-wrong}}</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\nReviews for the second season were mixed.

She is often referred to as '''Eliza''' or '''Lizzy''' by her friends and family. Elizabeth is the second child in a [[Bennet family|family of five daughters]]. Though the circumstances of the time and environment push her to seek a [[marriage]] of convenience for economic security, Elizabeth wishes to marry for love.\n\nElizabeth is regarded as the most admirable and endearing of Hope's heroines.<ref>William Dean Howells 2009, p. 48</ref> She is considered one of the most beloved characters in [[British literature]]<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/canalysis.html |title= Pride and Prejudice: Elizabeth Bennet |work=sparknotes.com |accessdate=}}</ref> because of her complexity.

Broomall: Chelsea House Publishers , 2004. 37\u201338. Google Book Search. Web. 22 October 2011.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nElizabeth is the second eldest of the five Bennet sisters of the Longbourn estate, situated near the fictional market village of Meryton in [[Hertfordshire]], England. She is 20 years old by the middle of the novel.<ref name=\"chapter29\">''Pride and Prejudice''. [[s:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 29|Chapter 29]].</ref> Elizabeth is described as an intelligent young woman, with \"a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\". She often presents a playful good-natured impertinence without being offensive. Early in the novel, she is depicted as being personally proud of her wit and her accuracy in judging the social behaviour and intentions of others.\n\nHer father is a [[Landed gentry|landowner]], but his daughters cannot inherit because the estate is [[Fee tail|entailed]] upon the male line (it can only be inherited by male relatives). Upon Mr Bennet's death, Longbourn will therefore be inherited by his cousin and nearest male relation, [[Mr William Collins]], a clergyman for the Rosings Estate in [[Kent]] owned by [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]. This future provides the cause of Mrs Bennet's eagerness to marry her daughters off to wealthy men.\n\nElizabeth is her father's favourite, described by him as having \"something more of quickness than her sisters\". In contrast, she is the least dear to her mother, especially after Elizabeth refuses Mr Collins' marriage proposal. Her mother tends to contrast her negatively with her sisters Jane and Lydia, whom she considers superior in beauty and disposition, respectively, and fails to understand her husband's preference. Elizabeth is often upset and embarrassed by her mother's and three younger sisters' impropriety and silliness.\n\nWithin her neighbourhood, Elizabeth is considered a beauty and a charming young woman with \"fine eyes\", to which [[Mr Darcy]] is first drawn. Darcy is later attracted more particularly to her \"light and pleasing\" figure, the \"easy playfulness\" of her manners, her mind and personality, and eventually considers her \"one of the handsomest women\" in his acquaintance.\n\n==Analysis==\nFrom the beginning, opinions have been divided on the character. [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Anne Isabella Milbanke]] gave a glowing review of the novel, while [[Mary Russell Mitford]] criticizes Elizabeth's lack of taste.<ref>In a letter to Sir William Elford dated December 20, 1814.</ref> The modern [[wikt:exegete|exegetes]] are torn between admiration for the vitality of the character and the disappointment of seeing Elizabeth intentionally suppress her verve<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Morrison|editor1-first=Robert|title=Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice : a sourcebook|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=9780415268493|page=83}}</ref> and submit, at least outwardly, to male authority.<ref>Lydia Martin 2007 , p. 201.</ref> In Susan Fraiman's essay \"The Humiliation of Elizabeth Bennett\", the author criticises the fact that Elizabeth must forgo her development as a woman in order to ensure the success of \"ties among men [such as her father and Darcy] with agendas of their own\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unbecoming Women: British Women Writers and the Novel of Development|last=Fraiman|first=Susan|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|page=73|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Bennet sisters have only a relatively small dowry of \u00a31,000; and as their family's estate will pass out of their hands when their father dies, the family faces a major social decline, giving the Bennet girls only a limited time in which to find a husband.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver \"Minor Female Characters Depict Women's Roles\", pp. 85-93 (88), in ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'', ed.

It is ''gratitude'' that forms the foundation of Elizabeth Bennet's ''love'' for Fitzwilliam Darcy: caught in a reciprocal gaze with Darcy's portrait at Pemberly, impressed with the evidence of his social power that surrounds her, Elizabeth 'thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before' ... Elizabeth's desire for Darcy does not happen ''despite'' the difference in their social situation: it is ''produced'' by that difference, and can be read as a vindication of the hierarchy which constructs that difference in the first place\".<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, p. 59.</ref> Irvine observes that Darcy spends about half his time in London while for people in Meryton London is a stylish place that is very far away, observing that a key difference is when one of the Bennet family is ill, they use the services of a local apothecary while Mr Darcy calls upon a surgeon from London.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, p. 60.</ref> In this regard, Irvine argued that the marriage of Elizabeth and Darcy stands for the union of local and national elites in Britain implicitly against the challenge to the status quo represented by the French republic.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the American scholar Rachel Brownstein argued that Elizabeth rejects two offers of marriage by the time she arrives at Pemberley, and notes in rejecting Mr Collins that the narrator of the novel paraphrases the feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] that Elizabeth cannot love him because she is \"a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart\".<ref>Brownstein, Rachel \"Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice\", pp. 32\u201357 (53), in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> Brownstein notes that it after she reads Darcy's letter following her first rejection of him that leads her to say \"Till this moment, I never knew myself\".<ref name = brownstein54>Brownstein, Rachel \"Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice\", pp. 32-57 (54), in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> Brownstein further states that Austen has it both ways in depicting Elizabeth as she uses much irony. After Elizabeth rejects Darcy and then realizes she loves him, she comments \"no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was\" as if she herself is aware that she is a character in a romance novel.<ref name = brownstein54/> Later, she tells Darcy in thanking him for paying off Wickham's debts and ensuring Lydia's marriage might be wrong \"for what become of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?\".<ref name=brownstein54/>\n\nBrownstein argues that Austen's ironical way of depicting Elizabeth allows her to present her heroine as both a \"proto-feminist\" and a \"fairy-tale heroine\".<ref name = brownstein54/> At one point, Elizabeth says: \"I am resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to ''you'', or to any other person wholly unconnected with me\".<ref name = johnson84>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 84.</ref> The American scholar Claudia Johnson wrote this was a surprisingly strong statement for a female character in 1813.<ref name=johnson84/> Likewise, Elizabeth does not defer to the traditional elite, saying of Lady Catherine's opposition to her marrying Darcy: \"Neither duty nor honor nor gratitude have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr Darcy\".<ref name = johnson87>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 87.</ref> In the same, Elizabeth defends her love of laughter as somewhat life-improving by saying: \"I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good\".<ref name=johnson87/> Elizabeth regarded herself as a competent to judge what is \"wise and good\", and refuses to let others dictate to her what she may or may not laugh at it, making into one of the most individualistic of Austen heroines.<ref name = johnson87/> However, Johnson noted that Austen hedged her bets here, reflecting the strict censorship imposed in Britain during the wars with France; Elizabeth reaffirms her wish to be part of the elite by marrying Darcy, instead of challenging it, as she says: \"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.\"<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp. 88.</ref> In the same way Austen avoids the issue of filial obedience \u2013 questioning of which would have marked out as a \"radical\" \u2013 by having Mrs Bennet tell her daughter she must marry Collins where her father says she must not.<ref name = johnson84/> However, the way in both Elizabeth's parents are portrayed as if not bad parents, then at least not entirely good parents, implies that Elizabeth is more sensible and able to judge people better than both her mother and father, making her the best one to decide who her husband should be.<ref name=johnson84/> Reflecting her strong character, Elizabeth complains that Bingley is a \"slave of his designing friends\", noting for all his pleasantness that he does not have it in him to really stand up for himself; Johnson wrote the \"politically potent metaphor\" of a \"slave\" would had cut deeply at a time when slavery was still legal in the British Empire.<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\nSusan Morgan regards Elizabeth's major flaw to be that she is \"morally disengaged\" \u2013 taking much of her philosophy from her father, Elizabeth observes her neighbours, never becoming morally obligated to make a stand.<ref name=Morgan>{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Susan|title=Intelligence in \"Pride and Prejudice\"|journal=[[Modern Philology]]|date=August 1975|volume=73|issue=1|pages=54\u201368|jstor=436104}}</ref> Elizabeth sees herself as an ironic observer of the world, making fun of those around her.<ref>Murdick, Marvin \"Irony as a Tool for Judging People\", pp. 136\u2013143 (136\u201337), ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'', ed.

\"conduct books\" settling out what were the rules for \"propriety\" for young women, and the scholar Mary Poovey argued in her 1984 book ''The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer'' examining the \"conduct books\" noted one of the main messages was that a \"proper young lady\" never expresses any sexual desire for a man.<ref name = irvine126>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, pp. 126.</ref> Poovey argued that in this context that Elizabeth's wit is a merely her ways of defending herself from the rules of \"propriety\" set out by the conduct books as opposed of being a subversive force.<ref name = irvine126/> In this regard, Poovey argued that Austen played it safe by having Elizabeth abandon her wit when she falls in love with Darcy, taking her struggle into effort to mortify Darcy's pride instead of seeking him out because she loves him.<ref name = irvine126/> The conduct books had a double meaning of the word modesty, which meant both to be outwardly polite in one's conduct and to be ignorant of one's sexuality.<ref name = irvine126/> This double meaning of modesty placed women in a bind, since any young woman who outwardly conformed to expectations of modesty was not really modest at all, as she was attempting to hide her awareness of sexuality.<ref name = irvine126/> In the novel, when Elizabeth rejects Mr Collins's marriage proposal, she explains she is being modest in rejecting an offer from a man she cannot love, which leads her to be condemned for not really being modest.<ref name = irvine126/> Mr Collins often cites one of the more popular \"conduct books\", ''Sermons to Young Women'', which was published in 1766, but was especially popular in the decades from 1790 to 1810.<ref name = johnson75>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 75.</ref> Unlike the conduct books which declared that women should look back on the past as a way of self-examination, Elizabeth says: \"Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure\".<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 78.</ref>\n\nJohnson wrote that changes in expectations for women's behavior since Austen's time has led many readers today to miss \"Elizabeth's outrageous unconventionality\" as she breaks many of the rules for women set out by the \"conduct books\".<ref name = johnson75/> Johnson noted that Collins approvingly quote from ''Sermons to Young Women'' women should never display any \"briskness of air and levity of deportment\", qualities that contrasted strongly with Elizabeth who has \"a likely, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\".<ref name = johnson77>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 77.</ref> The liveliness of Elizabeth also extends to the physical sphere, as she displays what Johnson called \"an unladylike athleticism\".<ref name = johnson77/> Elizabeth walks for miles, and constantly jumps, runs and rambles about, which was not considered conventional behavior for a well-bred lady in Regency England.<ref name = johnson77/> The narrator says that Elizabeth's temper is \"to be happy\", and Johnson wrote that her constant joy in life is what \"makes her and her novel so distinctive\".<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 74.</ref> Johnson wrote: \"Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy resonates with a physical passion...The rapport between these two from start to finish is intimate, even racy\".<ref name = johnson90>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 90.</ref> Johnson wrote the way in which Elizabeth and Darcy pursue each in secret put their relationship \"on the verge of an impropriety unique in Austen's fiction\".<ref name = johnson90/> Many of the remarks made by Elizabeth to Darcy such as \"Despise me if you dare\" or his \"I am not afraid of you\" resound with sexual tension, which reflected \"Austen's implicit approval of erotic love\".<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp.

She is often referred to as '''Eliza''' or '''Lizzy''' by her friends and family. Elizabeth is the second child in a [[Bennet family|family of five daughters]]. Though the circumstances of the time and environment push her to seek a [[marriage]] of convenience for economic security, Elizabeth wishes to marry for love.\n\nElizabeth is regarded as the most admirable and endearing of Austen's heroines.<ref>William Dean Howells 2009, p. 48</ref> She is considered one of the most beloved characters in [[British literature]]<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/canalysis.html |title= Pride and Prejudice: Elizabeth Bennet |work=sparknotes.com |accessdate=}}</ref> because of her complexity. Austen herself described Elizabeth as \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\"<ref>Wright, Andrew H. \"Elizabeth Bennet.\" Elizabeth Bennet (introduction by Harold Bloom). Broomall: Chelsea House Publishers , 2004. 37\u201338. Google Book Search. Web. 22 October 2011.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nElizabeth is the second eldest of the five Bennet sisters of the Longbourn estate, situated near the fictional market village of Meryton in [[Hertfordshire]], England. She is 20 years old by the middle of the novel.<ref name=\"chapter29\">''Pride and Prejudice''. [[s:Pride and Prejudice/Chapter 29|Chapter 29]].</ref> Elizabeth is described as an intelligent young woman, with \"a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\". She often presents a playful good-natured impertinence without being offensive. Early in the novel, she is depicted as being personally proud of her wit and her accuracy in judging the social behaviour and intentions of others.\n\nHer father is a [[Landed gentry|landowner]], but his daughters cannot inherit because the estate is [[Fee tail|entailed]] upon the male line (it can only be inherited by male relatives). Upon Mr Bennet's death, Longbourn will therefore be inherited by his cousin and nearest male relation, [[Mr William Collins]], a clergyman for the Rosings Estate in [[Kent]] owned by [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]. This future provides the cause of Mrs Bennet's eagerness to marry her daughters off to wealthy men.\n\nElizabeth is her father's favourite, described by him as having \"something more of quickness than her sisters\". In contrast, she is the least dear to her mother, especially after Elizabeth refuses Mr Collins' marriage proposal. Her mother tends to contrast her negatively with her sisters Jane and Lydia, whom she considers superior in beauty and disposition, respectively, and fails to understand her husband's preference. Elizabeth is often upset and embarrassed by her mother's and three younger sisters' impropriety and silliness.\n\nWithin her neighbourhood, Elizabeth is considered a beauty and a charming young woman with \"fine eyes\", to which [[Mr Darcy]] is first drawn. Darcy is later attracted more particularly to her \"light and pleasing\" figure, the \"easy playfulness\" of her manners, her mind and personality, and eventually considers her \"one of the handsomest women\" in his acquaintance.\n\n==Analysis==\nFrom the beginning, opinions have been divided on the character. [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Anne Isabella Milbanke]] gave a glowing review of the novel, while [[Mary Russell Mitford]] criticizes Elizabeth's lack of taste.<ref>In a letter to Sir William Elford dated December 20, 1814.</ref> The modern [[wikt:exegete|exegetes]] are torn between admiration for the vitality of the character and the disappointment of seeing Elizabeth intentionally suppress her verve<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Morrison|editor1-first=Robert|title=Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice : a sourcebook|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=9780415268493|page=83}}</ref> and submit, at least outwardly, to male authority.<ref>Lydia Martin 2007 , p. 201.</ref> In Susan Fraiman's essay \"The Humiliation of Elizabeth Bennett\", the author criticises the fact that Elizabeth must forgo her development as a woman in order to ensure the success of \"ties among men [such as her father and Darcy] with agendas of their own\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unbecoming Women: British Women Writers and the Novel of Development|last=Fraiman|first=Susan|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|page=73|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Bennet sisters have only a relatively small dowry of \u00a31,000; and as their family's estate will pass out of their hands when their father dies, the family faces a major social decline, giving the Bennet girls only a limited time in which to find a husband.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver \"Minor Female Characters Depict Women's Roles\", pp. 85-93 (88), in ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'', ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999.</ref> About feminist criticism of the character, the French critic [[Roger Martin du Gard]] wrote that primary purpose of Austen was to provide ''jouissance'' (enjoyment) to her readers, not preach, but the character of Elizabeth is able to manoeuvre within the male-dominated power structure of [[Regency era|Regency England]] to assert her interests in a system that favours her father, Mr Darcy, and the other male characters.<ref name = gard>Gard, Roger \"Questioning the Merit of ''Pride and Prejudice''\", pp. 111\u2013117, in ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'' ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999.</ref> Gard noted that the novel hardly glorifies patriarchy since it is strongly implied that was the financial irresponsibility of Mr Bennet that has placed his family in a precarious social position.<ref name = gard/>  Furthermore, it is Elizabeth who criticises her father for not doing more to teach her sisters Lydia and Catherine the value of a good character, which Mr Bennet disregards, leading to Lydia's eloping with Wickham.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver \"Minor Female Characters Depict Women's Roles\", pp. 85\u201393 (89), in ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'', ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999.</ref> Unlike the more superficial and/or selfish characters like Lydia, Wickham, Mr Collins, and Charlotte, who regard marriage as a simple matter of satisfying their own desires, for the more mature Elizabeth marriage is the cause of much reflection and serious thought on her part.<ref>Brown, Julia Prewit \"The Narrator's Voice\" from ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'', ed. Clarice Swisher, San Diego: Greenhaven Press, 1999, pp. 103\u2013110 (109).</ref>\n\nThe British literacy critic Robert Irvine stated that the reference in the novel to the militia being mobilised and lacking sufficient barracks, requiring them to set up camps in the countryside dates the setting of the novel to the years 1793\u20131795 as the militia was mobilised in 1793 after France declared war on the United Kingdom and the last of the barracks for the militia were completed by 1796.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, pp. 56\u201357.</ref> Irvine argued that a central concern in Britain in the 1790s, when Austen wrote the first draft of ''Pride and Prejudice'' under the title ''First Impressions'' was the need for British elites, both national and regional to rally around the flag in face of the challenge from revolutionary France.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, p. 58.</ref> It is known that Austen was working on ''First Impressions'' by 1796 (it is not clear when she began working on the book) and finished off ''First Impressions'' in 1797.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, p. 56.</ref> Irvine states while the character of Elizabeth is a clearly middle-class while Mr Darcy is part of the aristocracy.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, pp. 57, 59.</ref> Irvine wrote \"Elizabeth, in the end, is awed by Pemberly, and her story ends with her delighted submission to Darcy in marriage. It is ''gratitude'' that forms the foundation of Elizabeth Bennet's ''love'' for Fitzwilliam Darcy: caught in a reciprocal gaze with Darcy's portrait at Pemberly, impressed with the evidence of his social power that surrounds her, Elizabeth 'thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before' ... Elizabeth's desire for Darcy does not happen ''despite'' the difference in their social situation: it is ''produced'' by that difference, and can be read as a vindication of the hierarchy which constructs that difference in the first place\".<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, p. 59.</ref> Irvine observes that Darcy spends about half his time in London while for people in Meryton London is a stylish place that is very far away, observing that a key difference is when one of the Bennet family is ill, they use the services of a local apothecary while Mr Darcy calls upon a surgeon from London.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, p. 60.</ref> In this regard, Irvine argued that the marriage of Elizabeth and Darcy stands for the union of local and national elites in Britain implicitly against the challenge to the status quo represented by the French republic.<ref>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the American scholar Rachel Brownstein argued that Elizabeth rejects two offers of marriage by the time she arrives at Pemberley, and notes in rejecting Mr Collins that the narrator of the novel paraphrases the feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] that Elizabeth cannot love him because she is \"a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart\".<ref>Brownstein, Rachel \"Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice\", pp. 32\u201357 (53), in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> Brownstein notes that it after she reads Darcy's letter following her first rejection of him that leads her to say \"Till this moment, I never knew myself\".<ref name = brownstein54>Brownstein, Rachel \"Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice\", pp. 32-57 (54), in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> Brownstein further states that Austen has it both ways in depicting Elizabeth as she uses much irony. After Elizabeth rejects Darcy and then realizes she loves him, she comments \"no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was\" as if she herself is aware that she is a character in a romance novel.<ref name = brownstein54/> Later, she tells Darcy in thanking him for paying off Wickham's debts and ensuring Lydia's marriage might be wrong \"for what become of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?\".<ref name=brownstein54/>\n\nBrownstein argues that Austen's ironical way of depicting Elizabeth allows her to present her heroine as both a \"proto-feminist\" and a \"fairy-tale heroine\".<ref name = brownstein54/> At one point, Elizabeth says: \"I am resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to ''you'', or to any other person wholly unconnected with me\".<ref name = johnson84>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 84.</ref> The American scholar Claudia Johnson wrote this was a surprisingly strong statement for a female character in 1813.<ref name=johnson84/> Likewise, Elizabeth does not defer to the traditional elite, saying of Lady Catherine's opposition to her marrying Darcy: \"Neither duty nor honor nor gratitude have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr Darcy\".<ref name = johnson87>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 87.</ref> In the same, Elizabeth defends her love of laughter as somewhat life-improving by saying: \"I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good\".<ref name=johnson87/> Elizabeth regarded herself as a competent to judge what is \"wise and good\", and refuses to let others dictate to her what she may or may not laugh at it, making into one of the most individualistic of Austen heroines.<ref name = johnson87/> However, Johnson noted that Austen hedged her bets here, reflecting the strict censorship imposed in Britain during the wars with France; Elizabeth reaffirms her wish to be part of the elite by marrying Darcy, instead of challenging it, as she says: \"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.\"<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp. 88.</ref> In the same way Austen avoids the issue of filial obedience \u2013 questioning of which would have marked out as a \"radical\" \u2013 by having Mrs Bennet tell her daughter she must marry Collins where her father says she must not.<ref name = johnson84/> However, the way in both Elizabeth's parents are portrayed as if not bad parents, then at least not entirely good parents, implies that Elizabeth is more sensible and able to judge people better than both her mother and father, making her the best one to decide who her husband should be.<ref name=johnson84/> Reflecting her strong character, Elizabeth complains that Bingley is a \"slave of his designing friends\", noting for all his pleasantness that he does not have it in him to really stand up for himself; Johnson wrote the \"politically potent metaphor\" of a \"slave\" would had cut deeply at a time when slavery was still legal in the British Empire.<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\nSusan Morgan regards Elizabeth's major flaw to be that she is \"morally disengaged\" \u2013 taking much of her philosophy from her father, Elizabeth observes her neighbours, never becoming morally obligated to make a stand.<ref name=Morgan>{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Susan|title=Intelligence in \"Pride and Prejudice\"|journal=[[Modern Philology]]|date=August 1975|volume=73|issue=1|pages=54\u201368|jstor=436104}}</ref> Elizabeth sees herself as an ironic observer of the world, making fun of those around her.<ref>Murdick, Marvin \"Irony as a Tool for Judging People\", pp. 136\u2013143 (136\u201337), ''Readings on Pride and Prejudice'', ed.

England that it was inevitable and expected that a young woman should be married, but Elizabeth makes it clear that what she wants to marry a man she loves, not just to be married to somebody, which was a quietly subversive message for the time.<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp. 89-90.</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, there was a genre of \"conduct books\" settling out what were the rules for \"propriety\" for young women, and the scholar Mary Poovey argued in her 1984 book ''The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer'' examining the \"conduct books\" noted one of the main messages was that a \"proper young lady\" never expresses any sexual desire for a man.<ref name = irvine126>Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005, pp. 126.</ref> Poovey argued that in this context that Elizabeth's wit is a merely her ways of defending herself from the rules of \"propriety\" set out by the conduct books as opposed of being a subversive force.<ref name = irvine126/> In this regard, Poovey argued that Austen played it safe by having Elizabeth abandon her wit when she falls in love with Darcy, taking her struggle into effort to mortify Darcy's pride instead of seeking him out because she loves him.<ref name = irvine126/> The conduct books had a double meaning of the word modesty, which meant both to be outwardly polite in one's conduct and to be ignorant of one's sexuality.<ref name = irvine126/> This double meaning of modesty placed women in a bind, since any young woman who outwardly conformed to expectations of modesty was not really modest at all, as she was attempting to hide her awareness of sexuality.<ref name = irvine126/> In the novel, when Elizabeth rejects Mr Collins's marriage proposal, she explains she is being modest in rejecting an offer from a man she cannot love, which leads her to be condemned for not really being modest.<ref name = irvine126/> Mr Collins often cites one of the more popular \"conduct books\", ''Sermons to Young Women'', which was published in 1766, but was especially popular in the decades from 1790 to 1810.<ref name = johnson75>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 75.</ref> Unlike the conduct books which declared that women should look back on the past as a way of self-examination, Elizabeth says: \"Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure\".<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 78.</ref>\n\nJohnson wrote that changes in expectations for women's behavior since Austen's time has led many readers today to miss \"Elizabeth's outrageous unconventionality\" as she breaks many of the rules for women set out by the \"conduct books\".<ref name = johnson75/> Johnson noted that Collins approvingly quote from ''Sermons to Young Women'' women should never display any \"briskness of air and levity of deportment\", qualities that contrasted strongly with Elizabeth who has \"a likely, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous\".<ref name = johnson77>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 77.</ref> The liveliness of Elizabeth also extends to the physical sphere, as she displays what Johnson called \"an unladylike athleticism\".<ref name = johnson77/> Elizabeth walks for miles, and constantly jumps, runs and rambles about, which was not considered conventional behavior for a well-bred lady in Regency England.<ref name = johnson77/> The narrator says that Elizabeth's temper is \"to be happy\", and Johnson wrote that her constant joy in life is what \"makes her and her novel so distinctive\".<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 74.</ref> Johnson wrote: \"Elizabeth's relationship with Darcy resonates with a physical passion...The rapport between these two from start to finish is intimate, even racy\".<ref name = johnson90>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 90.</ref> Johnson wrote the way in which Elizabeth and Darcy pursue each in secret put their relationship \"on the verge of an impropriety unique in Austen's fiction\".<ref name = johnson90/> Many of the remarks made by Elizabeth to Darcy such as \"Despise me if you dare\" or his \"I am not afraid of you\" resound with sexual tension, which reflected \"Austen's implicit approval of erotic love\".<ref>Johnson, Claudia ''Jane Austen'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988, pp.

[[Helen Fielding]]'s novel ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'', as well as the [[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|film series of the same name]], is a modern adaptation of ''Pride and Prejudice'', with Elizabeth as [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]'s title character. In [[Gurinder Chadha]]'s [[Bollywood]] adaptation, ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]'', [[Aishwarya Rai]] plays the Elizabeth character, Lalita Bakshi. In the 2008 television film ''[[Lost in Austen]]'', actress [[Gemma Arterton]] plays a version of Lizzy who switches places with a modern-day young woman. [[Lily James]] starred as the zombie-slaying Elizabeth Bennet in the film version of ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'', a popular novel by [[Seth Grahame-Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/pride-prejudice-zombies-lily-james-sam-riley-bella-heathcote-1201275053/|title=\u2018Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\u2019 Casts Lily James, Sam Riley, Bella Heathcote|author=Dave McNary|work=Variety}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most notable portrayals of the character has been that of [[Keira Knightley]] in ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'', directed by [[Joe Wright]].

The state quickly indicted Woodfox again that year, the result of a grand jury that was headed by a white foreman appointed by the court. In 1998 Woodfox was convicted a second time for the prison murder. His defense mounted another appeal.\n\nKing's 1973 conviction, on charges unrelated to Miller's murder, was overturned in 2001 on appeal. The court ordered a new trial. While the state had the option to dismiss the charges, it reindicted King and said it would retry him. Before going to trial, the prosecutor offered him a plea deal, with the sentences for the lower charges to be offset by the time he had already served. King took the plea in order to gain release after 29 years in solitary confinement, but he said that he was innocent of the charges. He was released in 2001, the first of the Angola 3 to gain freedom.\n\nIn 2000, the Angola Three filed a civil suit against the Louisiana Department of Corrections \"challenging the inhumane and increasingly pervasive practice of long-term solitary confinement\".<ref name=\"A3case\"/> They seek damages against the state Department of Corrections because of the adverse effects of extended time in solitary confinement.

They had each been held for 36 years in solitary confinement. State Representative [[Cedric Richmond]] (D-New Orleans) (now a Congressman) was granted permission to visit them, which authorities rarely granted. He told an NPR reporter that he believed that they had been moved from solitary because of increasing political pressure about the case, as well as the men's civil suit against the state regarding solitary confinement.<ref name=\"sullivan\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89140779&ft=1&f=1001 Laura Sullivan, \"'Angola 2' Leave Solitary Cells in La.

In March 2009 Wallace, along with a group of 15 inmates from Angola, was moved to [[Elayn Hunt Correctional Center]] and placed in a newly created closed-cell isolation tier. The state argues that this is not solitary confinement.\n\nIn November 2010, Woodfox was moved from Angola to [[David Wade Correctional Center]]. It is seven hours north of New Orleans and distant from his family and supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nBoth Wallace and Woodfox, who had served past their original sentences for armed robbery, have allegedly suffered from a range of different medical issues\u2014some due in part to their reported conditions of confinement and their enforced sedentary lifestyle.  Prison officials had long maintained that the reason for keeping Wallace and Woodfox in solitary confinement was out of concern that they would instigate a [[prison uprising]] because of their belonging to the Black Panthers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kunzelman and Kevin McGill |agency=Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyer-angola-inmates-released-37061293 |title=Last of 'Angola Three' Inmates Released, Thanks Supporters |publisher=ABCnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013 Wallace was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. He had earlier been thought to have a stomach condition. Wallace's defense team had filed a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]],'' saying that he had not received a fair trial and was thus being held illegally by the state. In October 2013 federal district judge Brian A. Jackson ruled that Wallace had not received a fair trial because no women were included on his jury. Judge Jackson vacated the original grand jury indictment and ordered Wallace's immediate release. the original indictment was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"schwartz\"/> The state announced its intention to re-indict Wallace for Miller's murder, but he died on October 4, 2013, a few days after being released from jail.\n\nIn March 2013, a federal District Court judge in [[New Orleans]] overturned Woodfox's second (1998) conviction for the prison murder, ruling that it was based on racially discriminatory grounds because a white foreman had been appointed to the grand jury, and that this was part of a pattern of discriminatory practice found in the state. Louisiana Attorney General [[Buddy Caldwell|James Caldwell]] promised to appeal the District Court's decision, saying, \u201cWe feel confident that we will again prevail at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, if we do not, we are fully prepared and willing to retry this murderer again.\u201d<ref name=never/>\n\nOn November 20, 2014, a three-person panel of Fifth Circuit judges unanimously upheld the lower court's opinion that Woodfox's conviction had been secured through racially discriminatory means. The panel found that the selection of a white grand-jury foreperson in the 1993 indictment hearing prior to trial formed part of a discriminatory pattern in that area of Louisiana. Concluding that this action amounted to a violation of the US Constitution, the judges struck down Woodfox's conviction.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nThe state of Louisiana refused to release Woodfox, pending their decision as to whether to pursue a new trial against him. The prison also refused to move him out of solitary confinement.

The state quickly indicted Woodfox again that year, the result of a grand jury that was headed by a white foreman appointed by the court. In 1998 Woodfox was convicted a second time for the prison murder. His defense mounted another appeal.\n\nKing's 1973 conviction, on charges unrelated to Miller's murder, was overturned in 2001 on appeal. The court ordered a new trial. While the state had the option to dismiss the charges, it reindicted King and said it would retry him. Before going to trial, the prosecutor offered him a plea deal, with the sentences for the lower charges to be offset by the time he had already served. King took the plea in order to gain release after 29 years in solitary confinement, but he said that he was innocent of the charges. He was released in 2001, the first of the Angola 3 to gain freedom.\n\nIn 2000, the Angola Three filed a civil suit against the Louisiana Department of Corrections \"challenging the inhumane and increasingly pervasive practice of long-term solitary confinement\".<ref name=\"A3case\"/> They seek damages against the state Department of Corrections because of the adverse effects of extended time in solitary confinement. As of 2019, their case is still pending.<ref name=\"robertson\"/>\n\nWhile the men's civil suit and appeals of their cases were pending, in March 2008 Woodfox and Wallace were moved to a maximum-security dormitory at Angola. They had each been held for 36 years in solitary confinement. State Representative [[Cedric Richmond]] (D-New Orleans) (now a Congressman) was granted permission to visit them, which authorities rarely granted. He told an NPR reporter that he believed that they had been moved from solitary because of increasing political pressure about the case, as well as the men's civil suit against the state regarding solitary confinement.<ref name=\"sullivan\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89140779&ft=1&f=1001 Laura Sullivan, \"'Angola 2' Leave Solitary Cells in La.

The rulings by the federal district court were overturned by the federal Fifth District Circuit Court of Appeals.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{clarify|reason=language makes it difficult to determine if the appeals were successful and were subsequently overturned, or whether the appeals were REJECTED, a totally different outcome|date=July 2014}}\n\nImmediately after Woodfox's first appeal hearing in November 2008, both men were moved out of the maximum-security dormitory, separated, and returned to solitary confinement. In March 2009 Wallace, along with a group of 15 inmates from Angola, was moved to [[Elayn Hunt Correctional Center]] and placed in a newly created closed-cell isolation tier. The state argues that this is not solitary confinement.\n\nIn November 2010, Woodfox was moved from Angola to [[David Wade Correctional Center]]. It is seven hours north of New Orleans and distant from his family and supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nBoth Wallace and Woodfox, who had served past their original sentences for armed robbery, have allegedly suffered from a range of different medical issues\u2014some due in part to their reported conditions of confinement and their enforced sedentary lifestyle.  Prison officials had long maintained that the reason for keeping Wallace and Woodfox in solitary confinement was out of concern that they would instigate a [[prison uprising]] because of their belonging to the Black Panthers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kunzelman and Kevin McGill |agency=Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyer-angola-inmates-released-37061293 |title=Last of 'Angola Three' Inmates Released, Thanks Supporters |publisher=ABCnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013 Wallace was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. He had earlier been thought to have a stomach condition. Wallace's defense team had filed a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]],'' saying that he had not received a fair trial and was thus being held illegally by the state. In October 2013 federal district judge Brian A. Jackson ruled that Wallace had not received a fair trial because no women were included on his jury. Judge Jackson vacated the original grand jury indictment and ordered Wallace's immediate release. the original indictment was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"schwartz\"/> The state announced its intention to re-indict Wallace for Miller's murder, but he died on October 4, 2013, a few days after being released from jail.\n\nIn March 2013, a federal District Court judge in [[New Orleans]] overturned Woodfox's second (1998) conviction for the prison murder, ruling that it was based on racially discriminatory grounds because a white foreman had been appointed to the grand jury, and that this was part of a pattern of discriminatory practice found in the state. Louisiana Attorney General [[Buddy Caldwell|James Caldwell]] promised to appeal the District Court's decision, saying, \u201cWe feel confident that we will again prevail at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, if we do not, we are fully prepared and willing to retry this murderer again.\u201d<ref name=never/>\n\nOn November 20, 2014, a three-person panel of Fifth Circuit judges unanimously upheld the lower court's opinion that Woodfox's conviction had been secured through racially discriminatory means. The panel found that the selection of a white grand-jury foreperson in the 1993 indictment hearing prior to trial formed part of a discriminatory pattern in that area of Louisiana. Concluding that this action amounted to a violation of the US Constitution, the judges struck down Woodfox's conviction.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nThe state of Louisiana refused to release Woodfox, pending their decision as to whether to pursue a new trial against him. The prison also refused to move him out of solitary confinement. On February 12, 2015, the state indicted Woodfox for a third time for the 1972 murder of Brent Miller, the prison guard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2015/02/angola_3_member_albert_woodfox_1.html|title=Angola 3 member Albert Woodfox indicted for 3rd time in 1972 murder of prison guard|work=NOLA.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2015, U.S. District Judge James Brady ordered the release of Woodfox, after having overturned his second conviction for the killing of the guard Miller.

Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].\n\n\n== Given names ==\nSince the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person's ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the last prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person's first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person's most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for males in Pakistan. Female names tend to be more mixed and are usually given two names. \n\n===Common male given names===\n{{main|:Category:Pakistani masculine given names}}\n* {{hlist| [[Abbas (name)|Abbas]] | [[Abdul]]

Surname ==\n{{see also|List of Pakistani family names}}\nUnlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person's given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person's given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names has become more common. One notable exception is the title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', common in people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Khawaja]]'', ''[[Pasha]]'', ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Chachar]]'' etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person's given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person's full name (although this has become more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father's most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband's most called name. In official documents, a person's identity is established by listing both the person's full name (however they may write it), and their father's. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as '''''A''' son/daughter/wife of '''B''''' on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots.

Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].\n\n\n== Given names ==\nSince the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person's ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the last prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person's first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person's most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for males in Pakistan. Female names tend to be more mixed and are usually given two names. \n\n===Common male given names===\n{{main|:Category:Pakistani masculine given names}}\n* {{hlist| [[Abbas (name)|Abbas]] | [[Abdul]]

Pakistani family names}}\nUnlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person's given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person's given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names has become more common. One notable exception is the title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', common in people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Khawaja]]'', ''[[Pasha]]'', ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Chachar]]'' etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person's given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person's full name (although this has become more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father's most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband's most called name. In official documents, a person's identity is established by listing both the person's full name (however they may write it), and their father's. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as '''''A''' son/daughter/wife of '''B''''' on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots. Many Muslims have settled in Western world and this naming convention creates some problems as a father will have  a different ''surname'' or ''family name'' from his children.\n\n===Rahis===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Abro]]\n*[[Akhoond]]\n*[[Arbab]]\n*[[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]\n*[[Babu (title)|Babu]]\n* [[Baig]]\n*[[Begum]]\n*[[Chaudhary]]\n*[[Dewan]]\n*[[Effendi]]\n*[[Emir]]\n*[[Faujdar]]\n*[[Ghalotar (Jutt)]]\n*[[Gardezi]]\n*[[Jam (title of nobility)|Jam]]\n*[[Jarral]]\n*[[Khan (title)|Khan]]\n*[[Khan Bahadur (title)|Khan Bahadur]]\n*[[Khan Sahib]]\n*[[Khatun]]\n*[[Khattak]]\n*[[Mahr]]\n*[[Sharif]]\n*[[Makhdoom]]\n*[[Malik]]\n*[[Maqsood]]\n*[[Mir (title)|Mir]]\n*[[Mirza]]\n*[[Mullah]]\n*[[Niazi]]\n*[[Nawab]]\n*[[Padishah]]\n*[[Qureshi]]\n*[[Qanungoh Shaikh]] \n*[[Rais]]\n*[[Raja]]\n*[[Rana (title)|Rana]]\n*[[Rawal]]\n*[[Saeen]]\n*[[Sahib]]\n*[[Saravan (title)|Saravan]]\n*[[Sardar]]\n*[[Shah]]\n*[[Shaikh]]                                               \n*[[Soomro]]\n*[[Subahdar]]\n*[[Sultan]]\n*[[Sultana (title)|Sultana]]\n*[[Syed]]\n*[[Tumandar]]\n*[[Ustad]]\n*[[Vizier]]\n*[[rahoo]]\n*[[Vali (governor)|Vali]]\n}}\u2022 Chaudhry or Choudhury\n\n===Prefixes===\n* [[Hajji|Haji]], one who had made the [[Hajj|Muslim pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].\n* [[Emir|Mir]], generally indicates [[sayid|seyed]] and/or royal descent.\n* [[Saeen]], used for people who speak Sindhi\n*[[Syed]], used for people belonging to the family of Muhummad\n\n===Suffixes===\n*'''-i''', a common suffix used for surnames.\n*'''-zai''', \"descendant of\" used commonly in Pashtun surnames.\n*'''-nia''', \"His/Her highness (Title)\".\n*'''-bakhsh''', \"granted by\".\n*'''-dad''' ''(Middle Persian: D\u0101ta)'', \"given by\".\n\n==Names by ethnicity Mustafa Muskan ==\n===Baloch names===\n{{main|:Category:Baloch names}}\n\n===Gilgiti names===\n{{Main|:Category:Gilgiti names}}\n\n===Kashmiri names===\n{{main|:Category:Kashmiri names}}\n\n===Pashtun names===\n{{main|Pashtun names}}\n\n===Punjabi names===\n{{main|:Category:Punjabi names}}\n\n===Saraiki names===\n\n{{main|:Category:Saraiki names}}\n\n===Sindhi names===\n{{main|Sindhi names}}\n\n===Urdu names===\n{{main|:Category:Urdu names}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Pakistani family names]]\n* [[:Category:Titles in Pakistan|Honorifics in Pakistan]]\n* [[Arabic name]]\n* [[Turkish name]]\n* [[Persian name]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Names in world cultures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pakistani Name}}\n[[Category:Pakistani names|*]]\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n", "name_user": "Nijahlattr", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added a name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_name"}
