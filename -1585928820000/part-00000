They must, therefore, be distinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study (e.g. music or technology), and from abilities inherent in the student, such as aspects of intelligence or [[learning styles]].\n\n== Historical context ==\nThe term ''study skills'' is used for general approaches to learning, skills for specific courses of study.  There are many theoretical works on the subject, including a vast number of popular books and websites.  Manuals for students have been published since the 1940s {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, college instructors in the fields of psychology and the study of education used to research, theory, and experience with their own students in writing manuals.<ref>, Preston, Rah (1959).

The act of memorization is often a deliberate mental process undertaken in order to store in memory for later recall items such as experiences, names, appointments, addresses, telephone numbers, lists, stories, poems, pictures, maps, diagrams, facts, music or other visual, auditory, or tactical information. Memorization may also refer to the process of storing particular data into the memory of a device. \nOne of the most basic approaches to learning any information is simply to repeat it by rote.  Typically this will include reading over notes or a textbook and re-writing notes.\n\n=== Reading and listening ===\n<!-- [[PQRST (study skill)]] links here! -->\n\nThe weakness of rote learning is that it implies a passive reading and listening style. Educators such as [[John Dewey]] have argued that students need to learn [[critical thinking]] \u2013 questioning and weighing up evidence as they learn. This can be done during lectures or when reading books.\n\nA method that is useful during the first interaction with the subject of [[study|https://thehometutions.in/]] is '''REAP method'''. This method helps students to improve their understanding of the text and bridge the idea with that of the author's. REAP is an acronym for '''R'''ead, '''E'''ncode, '''A'''nnotate and '''P'''onder.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sheryn Spencer-Waterman|title=Handbook on Differentiated Instruction for Middle & High Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSIEAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA61|date=9 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-93008-2|page=61}}</ref>\n\n#'''Read''': Reading a section to discern the idea.\n#'''Encode''': Paraphrasing the idea from the author's perspective to the student's own words.\n#'''Annotate''': Annotating the section with critical understanding and other relevant notes.\n#'''Ponder''': To ponder about what they read through thinking, discussing with others and reading related materials.

These have numerous uses in teaching and learning but can be used for revision.  Students often make their own [[flashcard]]s, or more detailed '''index cards''' \u2013 cards designed for filing, often A5 size, on which short summaries are written.  Being discrete and separate, they have the advantage of allowing students to re-order them, pick a selection to read over, or choose randomly for self-testing.  Software equivalents can be used.\n\n=== Summary methods ===\n\nSummary methods vary depending on the topic, but most involve condensing the large amount of information from a course or book into shorter notes.  Often, these notes are then condensed further into key facts.\n\n'''Organized summaries:''' Such as [[outline (list)|outlines]] showing [[Index term|keywords]] and definitions and relations, usually in a [[tree structure]].\n\n'''Spider diagrams:''' Using [[spider diagram]]s or [[mind map]]s can be an effective way of linking concepts together. They can be useful for planning essays and essay responses in exams.  These tools can give a visual summary of a topic that preserves its logical structure, with lines used to show how different parts link together.\n\n===Visual imagery ===\n\nSome learners are thought to have a visual [[learning style]], and will benefit greatly from taking information from their studies which are often heavily verbal, and using [[Mental image|visual techniques]] to help encode and retain it in memory.\n\nSome memory techniques make use of visual memory, for example the [[method of loci]], a system of visualising key information in real physical locations e.g. around a room.\n\n'''Diagrams''' are often underrated tools.{{cn|date=May 2018}} They can be used to bring all the information together and provide practice reorganizing what has been learned in order to produce something practical and useful. They can also aid the recall of information learned very quickly, particularly if the student made the diagram while studying the information.  Pictures can then be transferred to flashcards that are very effective last-minute revision tools rather than rereading any written material.\n\n=== Acronyms and mnemonics ===\n\nA '''mnemonic''' is a method of organizing and memorizing information.  Some use a simple phrase or fact as a trigger for a longer list of information.  For example, the cardinal points of the [[compass]] can be recalled in the correct order with the phrase \"'''N'''ever '''E'''at '''S'''hredded '''W'''heat\".  Starting with '''North''', the first letter of each word relates to a compass point in clockwise order round a compass. \n\n===Exam strategies ===\n\nThe '''Black-Red-Green method''' (developed through the Royal Literary Fund) helps the student to ensure that every aspect of the question posed has been considered, both in [[exam]]s and essays.<ref>Royal Literary Fund: ''Mission Possible: the Study Skills Pack'' http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/mission_possible.cfm</ref>  The student underlines relevant parts of the question using three separate colors (or some equivalent).  '''BLA'''ck denotes ''''BLA'''tant instructions', i.e. something that clearly must be done; a directive or obvious instruction. '''RE'''d is a '''RE'''ference Point or '''RE'''quired input of some kind, usually to do with definitions, terms, cited authors, theory, etc. (either explicitly referred to or strongly implied).  '''GRE'''en denotes '''GRE'''mlins, which are subtle signals one might easily miss, or a \u2018'''GRE'''EN Light\u2019 that gives a hint on how to proceed, or where to place the emphasis in answers [https://web.archive.org/web/20061004191812/http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/documents/answerquestionb.pdf]. Another popular method whilst studying is to P.E.E; Point, evidence and explain, reason being, this helps the student break down exam questions allowing them to maximize their marks/grade during the exam. Many Schools will encourage practicing the P.E. BEing method prior to an exam.\n\n=== Spacing ===\n'''Spacing''', also called '''distributed learning''' by some; helps individuals remember at least as much if not more information for a longer period of time than using only one study skill. Using spacing in addition to other study methods can improve retention and performance on tests.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Spacing is especially useful for retaining and recalling new material.<ref name=\":0\" /> The theory of spacing is that instead of cramming all studying into one long study session an individual would split that single session to a few shorter sessions that are hours, if not days apart. Studying will not last longer than it would have originally and one is not working harder but this tool gives the user the ability to remember and recall things for a longer time period. The science behind this; according to Jost\u2019s Law from 1897 \u201cIf two associations are of equal strength but of different age, a new repetition has a greater value for the older one\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=68}}</ref> This means that if a person were to study two things once, at different times, the one studied most recently will be easier to recall.\n\n=== Time management, organization and lifestyle changes<ref>College Success: Study Strategies and Skills, Jean A. Reynolds, \u00a91996 by Allyn & Bacon, Boston</ref> ===\n\nOften, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to things unrelated to the study material itself, such as [[Time management|time-management]], boosting [[motivation]] and avoiding [[procrastination]], and in improvements to [[sleep]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].\n\nTime management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest benefit are given the greatest focus.  A '''traffic lights''' system is a simple way of identifying the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours:\n* Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple\n* Amber: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming\n* Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital.\n\nThis reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit, while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows.  The concept is similar to the [[ABC analysis]], commonly used by workers to help prioritize. Also, some websites (such as [[FlashNotes]]) can be used for additional study materials and may help improve time management and increase motivation.\n\nIn addition to time management, sleep is important; getting adequate rest improves memorisation.<ref>[https://www.teenlife.com/blogs/articles/how-study-more-efficiently Study Efficiently] TeenLife Media, January, 2015</ref> Students are generally more productive in the morning than the afternoon. <ref>http://home.uchicago.edu/~npope/morning_afternoon.pdf</ref>\n\nIn addition to time management and sleep, emotional state of mind can matter when a student is studying. If an individual is calm or nervous in class; replicating that emotion can assist in studying. With replicating the emotion an individual is more likely to recall more information if they are in the same state of mind when in class. This also goes the other direction; if one is upset but normally calm in class it\u2019s much better to wait until they are feeling calmer to study. At the time of the test or class they will remember more. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=47}}</ref> \n\n=== Study environment ===\nStudying can also be more effective if one changes their environment while studying. For example: the first time studying the material, one can study in a bedroom, the second time one can study outside, and the final time one can study in a coffee shop. The thinking behind this is that as when an individual changes their environment the brain associates different aspects of the learning and gives a stronger hold and additional brain pathways with which to access the information. In this context environment can mean many things; from location, to sounds, to smells, to other stimuli including foods. When discussing environment in regards to its effect on studying and retention Carey says \u201ca simple change in venue improved retrieval strength (memory) by 40 percent.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=62}}</ref> Another change in the environment can be background music; if people study with music playing and they are able to play the same music during test time they will recall more of the information they studied.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref> According to Carey \u201cbackground music weaves itself subconsciously into the fabric of stored memory.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=51}}</ref> This \u201cdistraction\u201d in the background helps to create more vivid memories with the studied material.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHomework completion is typically irrelevant to academic performance. <ref>http://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/news/the-homework-debate-the-case-against-homework/</ref>\n\n===Analogues===\n\nAnalogies can create misleading or superficial mental models in learners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theelearningcoach.com/learning/analogies-for-learning/ |title=How To Write Better Analogies For Learning |first=Connie |last=Malamed |year=2013 |access-date=5 July 2019 |work=The eLearning Coach}}</ref>\n\n===Concept mapping===\n\nThere is some support for the efficacy of concept mapping as a learning tool.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-talk/concept-map-learning-tool-any-subject |title=The concept map: a learning tool for any subject |first=Noelle Christiane |last=Boucquey |date=1 April 2015 |access-date=5 July 2019 |work=[[Stanford University]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homework]]\n*[[Learning]]\n*[[Andragogy#Adult learning styles|Learning styles]]\n*[[Reading day]]\n*[[Speed reading]]\n*[[SQ3R]]\n*[[Study guide]]\n*[[Study software]]\n*[[Video study guide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Study Skills}}\n*[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/pspi/learning-techniques.html Improving Students\u2019 Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology] from ''[[Association for Psychological Science]]''\n*[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/videos/index.html Academic learning strategy videos] from ''[[Dartmouth College]]'' provide skills training\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130728588&sc=fb&cc=fp Think You Know How To Study?

Some use a simple phrase or fact as a trigger for a longer list of information.  For example, the cardinal points of the [[compass]] can be recalled in the correct order with the phrase \"'''N'''ever '''E'''at '''S'''hredded '''W'''heat\".  Starting with '''North''', the first letter of each word relates to a compass point in clockwise order round a compass. \n\n===Exam strategies ===\n\nThe '''Black-Red-Green method''' (developed through the Royal Literary Fund) helps the student to ensure that every aspect of the question posed has been considered, both in [[exam]]s and essays.<ref>Royal Literary Fund: ''Mission Possible: the Study Skills Pack'' http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/mission_possible.cfm</ref>  The student underlines relevant parts of the question using three separate colors (or some equivalent).  '''BLA'''ck denotes ''''BLA'''tant instructions', i.e. something that clearly must be done; a directive or obvious instruction. '''RE'''d is a '''RE'''ference Point or '''RE'''quired input of some kind, usually to do with definitions, terms, cited authors, theory, etc. (either explicitly referred to or strongly implied).  '''GRE'''en denotes '''GRE'''mlins, which are subtle signals one might easily miss, or a \u2018'''GRE'''EN Light\u2019 that gives a hint on how to proceed, or where to place the emphasis in answers [https://web.archive.org/web/20061004191812/http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/writing/documents/answerquestionb.pdf]. Another popular method whilst studying is to P.E.E; Point, evidence and explain, reason being, this helps the student break down exam questions allowing them to maximize their marks/grade during the exam. Many Schools will encourage practicing the P.E. BEing method prior to an exam.\n\n=== Spacing ===\n'''Spacing''', also called '''distributed learning''' by some; helps individuals remember at least as much if not more information for a longer period of time than using only one study skill. Using spacing in addition to other study methods can improve retention and performance on tests.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Spacing is especially useful for retaining and recalling new material.<ref name=\":0\" /> The theory of spacing is that instead of cramming all studying into one long study session an individual would split that single session to a few shorter sessions that are hours, if not days apart. Studying will not last longer than it would have originally and one is not working harder but this tool gives the user the ability to remember and recall things for a longer time period. The science behind this; according to Jost\u2019s Law from 1897 \u201cIf two associations are of equal strength but of different age, a new repetition has a greater value for the older one\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=68}}</ref> This means that if a person were to study two things once, at different times, the one studied most recently will be easier to recall.\n\n=== Time management, organization and lifestyle changes<ref>College Success: Study Strategies and Skills, Jean A. Reynolds, \u00a91996 by Allyn & Bacon, Boston</ref> ===\n\nOften, improvements to the effectiveness of study may be achieved through changes to things unrelated to the study material itself, such as [[Time management|time-management]], boosting [[motivation]] and avoiding [[procrastination]], and in improvements to [[sleep]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].\n\nTime management in study sessions aims to ensure that activities that achieve the greatest benefit are given the greatest focus.  A '''traffic lights''' system is a simple way of identifying the importance of information, highlighting or underlining information in colours:\n* Green: topics to be studied first; important and also simple\n* Amber: topics to be studied next; important but time-consuming\n* Red: lowest priority; complex and not vital.\n\nThis reminds students to start with the things which will provide the quickest benefit, while 'red' topics are only dealt with if time allows.  The concept is similar to the [[ABC analysis]], commonly used by workers to help prioritize. Also, some websites (such as [[FlashNotes]]) can be used for additional study materials and may help improve time management and increase motivation.\n\nIn addition to time management, sleep is important; getting adequate rest improves memorisation.<ref>[https://www.teenlife.com/blogs/articles/how-study-more-efficiently Study Efficiently] TeenLife Media, January, 2015</ref> Students are generally more productive in the morning than the afternoon. <ref>http://home.uchicago.edu/~npope/morning_afternoon.pdf</ref>\n\nIn addition to time management and sleep, emotional state of mind can matter when a student is studying. If an individual is calm or nervous in class; replicating that emotion can assist in studying. With replicating the emotion an individual is more likely to recall more information if they are in the same state of mind when in class. This also goes the other direction; if one is upset but normally calm in class it\u2019s much better to wait until they are feeling calmer to study. At the time of the test or class they will remember more. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=47}}</ref> \n\n=== Study environment ===\nStudying can also be more effective if one changes their environment while studying. For example: the first time studying the material, one can study in a bedroom, the second time one can study outside, and the final time one can study in a coffee shop. The thinking behind this is that as when an individual changes their environment the brain associates different aspects of the learning and gives a stronger hold and additional brain pathways with which to access the information. In this context environment can mean many things; from location, to sounds, to smells, to other stimuli including foods. When discussing environment in regards to its effect on studying and retention Carey says \u201ca simple change in venue improved retrieval strength (memory) by 40 percent.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=62}}</ref> Another change in the environment can be background music; if people study with music playing and they are able to play the same music during test time they will recall more of the information they studied.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref> According to Carey \u201cbackground music weaves itself subconsciously into the fabric of stored memory.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Surprising Truth About How We Learn And Why It Happens|last=Carey|first=Benedict|publisher=Random House|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8129-8429-3|location=New York|pages=51}}</ref> This \u201cdistraction\u201d in the background helps to create more vivid memories with the studied material.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHomework completion is typically irrelevant to academic performance. <ref>http://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/news/the-homework-debate-the-case-against-homework/</ref>\n\n===Analogues===\n\nAnalogies can create misleading or superficial mental models in learners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theelearningcoach.com/learning/analogies-for-learning/ |title=How To Write Better Analogies For Learning |first=Connie |last=Malamed |year=2013 |access-date=5 July 2019 |work=The eLearning Coach}}</ref>\n\n===Concept mapping===\n\nThere is some support for the efficacy of concept mapping as a learning tool.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-talk/concept-map-learning-tool-any-subject |title=The concept map: a learning tool for any subject |first=Noelle Christiane |last=Boucquey |date=1 April 2015 |access-date=5 July 2019 |work=[[Stanford University]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Homework]]\n*[[Learning]]\n*[[Andragogy#Adult learning styles|Learning styles]]\n*[[Reading day]]\n*[[Speed reading]]\n*[[SQ3R]]\n*[[Study guide]]\n*[[Study software]]\n*[[Video study guide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Study Skills}}\n*[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/pspi/learning-techniques.html Improving Students\u2019 Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology] from ''[[Association for Psychological Science]]''\n*[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/videos/index.html Academic learning strategy videos] from ''[[Dartmouth College]]'' provide skills training\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130728588&sc=fb&cc=fp Think You Know How To Study?

These atrocities were sometimes collectively referred to by European contemporaries as the \"Congo Horrors\", and were particularly associated with the labour policies used to collect [[natural rubber]] for export. With the majority of the Free State's revenues derived from the export of rubber, a labour policy (known by critics as the \"Red Rubber system\") was created to maximise its extraction.

The rubber boom and the associated need for a large workforce had a significant negative effect on the indigenous population across Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. As rubber plantations grew, labor shortages increased. The owners of the plantations or rubber barons were rich, but those who collected the rubber made very little as a large amount of rubber was needed to be profitable. The rubber barons rounded up all the Indians and forced them to tap rubber out of the trees. One plantation started with 50,000 Indians and when discovered of the killings, only 8,000 were still alive. Slavery and systematic brutality were widespread, and in some areas, 90% of the Indian population was wiped out. These rubber plantations were part of the Brazilian rubber market, which declined as rubber plantations in southeast Asia became more effective.<ref>[http://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3104-why-do-they-hide Why do they hide?], Survival International:</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hunger Plan]], a German plan to starve the Slavic and Jewish populations\n*[[Penal labour]]\n*[[J\u00e4gerstab]]\n*[[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)]]\n*[[Death march]]\n*[[Utilitarian genocide]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{in lang|de}} St\u00e9phane Courtois: ''Das Schwarzbuch des Kommunismus, Unterdr\u00fcckung, Verbrechen und Terror''.

These atrocities were sometimes collectively referred to by European contemporaries as the \"Congo Horrors\", and were particularly associated with the labour policies used to collect [[natural rubber]] for export. With the majority of the Free State's revenues derived from the export of rubber, a labour policy (known by critics as the \"Red Rubber system\") was created to maximise its extraction. Labour was demanded by the administration as taxation.{{efn|Demanding taxation in the form of forced labour was common across colonial Africa at the time.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267\u20138}}{{Citation not found|date=April 2020}} }}\n\nThis created a \"slave society\", as companies became increasingly dependent on forcibly mobilising Congolese labour for their collection of rubber.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}}{{Citation not found|date=April 2020}} Workers who refused to supply their labour were coerced with \"constraint and repression\".

Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labor camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labor camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organized for labor purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticizes other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labor. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labor and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref>\"Hannah Arendt ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 - 45\"</ref>\n\nAccording to formerly secret internal Gulag documents, some 1.6 million people must have died in the period between 1930 and 1956 in Soviet forced labour camps and colonies (excluding prisoner-of-war camps), though these figures only include the deaths in the colonies beginning in 1935.

The rubber boom and the associated need for a large workforce had a significant negative effect on the indigenous population across Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. As rubber plantations grew, labor shortages increased. The owners of the plantations or rubber barons were rich, but those who collected the rubber made very little as a large amount of rubber was needed to be profitable. The rubber barons rounded up all the Indians and forced them to tap rubber out of the trees. One plantation started with 50,000 Indians and when discovered of the killings, only 8,000 were still alive. Slavery and systematic brutality were widespread, and in some areas, 90% of the Indian population was wiped out. These rubber plantations were part of the Brazilian rubber market, which declined as rubber plantations in southeast Asia became more effective.<ref>[http://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3104-why-do-they-hide Why do they hide?], Survival International:</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hunger Plan]], a German plan to starve the Slavic and Jewish populations\n*[[Penal labour]]\n*[[J\u00e4gerstab]]\n*[[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)]]\n*[[Death march]]\n*[[Utilitarian genocide]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{in lang|de}} St\u00e9phane Courtois: ''Das Schwarzbuch des Kommunismus, Unterdr\u00fcckung, Verbrechen und Terror''.

It is inspired from [[JSON-RPC]], but the lack of a service description specification with documentation in JSON-RPC sparked the design of JSON-WSP.\n\nThe description format has the same purpose for JSON-WSP as [[WSDL]] has for [[SOAP]] or [[Interface description language|IDL]] for [[CORBA]], which is to describe the types and methods used in a given service. It also describes inter-type relations (i.e. nested types) and defines which types are expected as method arguments and which types the user can expect to receive as method return values. Finally the description opens the possibility to add documentation on service, method, parameter and return levels.\n\nCommunication between clients and a JSON-WSP server is carried out using [[HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|first1=Fielding|last1=Roy|first2=Reschke|last2=Julian|website=Tools.ietf.org|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> requests and responses, with the JSON objects as data with the content-type application/json.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140936/http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.html |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\nJSON-WSP consists of four JSON object specifications:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Specification\n!Description\n|-\n|description\n|Service description specification (like [[WSDL]]). This specification describes methods, method parameters, types and return types. It also supports user documentation on service, method and parameter levels.\n|-\n|request\n|Specification for JSON requests. It contains information about which method that is to be invoked and all the arguments for the method call. Arguments in the request must obey the parameter definition of the same method described in the corresponding JSON-WSP description.\n|-\n|response\n|Specification for JSON responses. The response object contains the result of a service method invocation. The return type must obey the defined return type of the same method in the corresponding JSON-WSP description.\n|-\n|fault\n|Specification for JSON fault responses. The fault object contains a fault code and a fault string. The fault information specifies whether the fault occurred on the client or server side.

It can be used anywhere in the description as a primitive type. In requests and responses that involve attachments, the message format must be [[MIME#Multipart messages|multipart/related]] where the attachments are transported as mimeparts of media type: [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-4.5.1 application/octet-stream] with no Content-Transfer-Encoding (only raw binary). Mimeparts must have a unique CONTENT-ID in their entity headers. Attachment values in the JSON-WSP request/response objects must match the regular expression \"^cid:(.+)$\" where the capture group maps to one of the mimepart's CONTENT-ID.\n\n=== Attachment service description example ===\nThe following example shows what a simple JSON-WSP description with attachments could look like:\n\n<source lang=\"json\">\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/description\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"url\": \"http://mysite.com/TransferService/jsonwsp\",\n    \"servicename\": \"TransferService\",\n    \"types\": {\n        \"File\": {\n            \"data\": \"attachment\",\n            \"name\": \"string\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"methods\": {\n        \"upload\": {\n            \"ret_info\": {\n                \"doc_lines\": [],\n                \"type\": \"number\"\n            },\n            \"doc_lines\": [],\n            \"params\": {\n                \"incoming\": {\n                    \"def_order\": 1,\n                    \"doc_lines\": [],\n                    \"type\": [ \"File\" ],\n                    \"optional\": false\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Attachment service request example ===\nA request to the method \"upload\" described above could look like this:\n\n<source lang=\"mime\">\nContent-Type: multipart/related; boundary=\"2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\"\n\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/json, charset=UTF-8\nContent-ID: body\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/request\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"methodname\": \"upload\",\n    \"args\": {\n        \"incoming\": [ {\n            \"data\": \"cid:img2354.png\",\n            \"name\": \"face.png\"\n        }, {\n            \"data\": \"cid:cv.pdf\",\n            \"name\": \"cv.pdf\"\n        } ]\n    }\n}\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-ID: img2354.png\n\n<png-image binary data>\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-ID: cv.pdf\n\n<pdf-image binary data>\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25--\n</source>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[JSON-RPC]] JSON-based remote procedure call\n* [[JSON#JSON Schema|JSON Schema]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Web service specifications]]\n[[Category:Remote procedure call]]\n[[Category:JSON]]\n", "text_old": ":[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=757972316 This article] is on hold ([[Talk:JSON-WSP#Why has the content been deleted.3F|will be deleted]]), perhaps you are searching for [[JSON-RPC]] or [[JSON#JSON Schema|JSON Schema]].\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=July 2014}}\n{{Notability|date=January 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}}}\n\n'''JSON-WSP''' (JavaScript Object Notation Web-Service Protocol) is a web-service protocol that uses [[JSON]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|format=PDF|title=ECMAScript \u2013 2017 Language Specification|website=Ecma-international.org|access-date=28 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412040502/http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> for service description, requests and responses.

It also describes inter-type relations (i.e. nested types) and defines which types are expected as method arguments and which types the user can expect to receive as method return values.

It also stores information about the type and version of itself.\n\nThe optional '''mirror''' value can be used to send information from the client which will then be reflected by the server and returned unchanged in the response object's '''reflection''' value. This feature allows clients to send multiple requests to a method and send request identification values that can be intercepted by the client's response handler. This is often necessary from javascript if more than one request is being processed simultaneously by the server and the response order is unknown by the client.\n\n==== Specification ====\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/request\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"methodname\": <method-name>,\n    \"args\": { ( <key>: <value>, )* }(,\n    \"mirror\": <value> )?\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Response object ===\n\n==== Specification ====\nThe '''reflection''' value is an unchanged server reflection of the request object's '''mirror''' value.

It can be used anywhere in the description as a primitive type. In requests and responses that involve attachments, the message format must be [[MIME#Multipart messages|multipart/related]] where the attachments are transported as mimeparts of media type: [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-4.5.1 application/octet-stream] with no Content-Transfer-Encoding (only raw binary). Mimeparts must have a unique CONTENT-ID in their entity headers. Attachment values in the JSON-WSP request/response objects must match the regular expression \"^cid:(.+)$\" where the capture group maps to one of the mimepart's CONTENT-ID.\n\n=== Attachment service description example ===\nThe following example shows what a simple JSON-WSP description with attachments could look like:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/description\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"url\": \"http://mysite.com/TransferService/jsonwsp\",\n    \"servicename\": \"TransferService\",\n    \"types\": {\n        \"File\": {\n            \"data\": \"attachment\",\n            \"name\": \"string\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"methods\": {\n        \"upload\": {\n            \"ret_info\": {\n                \"doc_lines\": [],\n                \"type\": \"number\"\n            },\n            \"doc_lines\": [],\n            \"params\": {\n                \"incoming\": {\n                    \"def_order\": 1,\n                    \"doc_lines\": [],\n                    \"type\": [ \"File\" ],\n                    \"optional\": false\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Attachment service request example ===\nA request to the method \"upload\" described above could look like this:\n\n<source lang=\"mime\">\nContent-Type: multipart/related; boundary=\"2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\"\n\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/json, charset=UTF-8\nContent-ID: body\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/request\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"methodname\": \"upload\",\n    \"args\": {\n        \"incoming\": [ {\n            \"data\": \"cid:img2354.png\",\n            \"name\": \"face.png\"\n        }, {\n            \"data\": \"cid:cv.pdf\",\n            \"name\": \"cv.pdf\"\n        } ]\n    }\n}\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-ID: img2354.png\n\n<png-image binary data>\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-ID: cv.pdf\n\n<pdf-image binary data>\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25--\n</source>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[JSON-RPC]] JSON-based remote procedure call\n* [[JSON#JSON Schema|JSON Schema]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Web service specifications]]\n[[Category:Remote procedure call]]\n[[Category:JSON]]\n", "name_user": "Cedar101", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAttachment service description example:lang=\"json\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-WSP"}

The film explores Johnson's varied, often aggressive attempts at rationalizing what he did, revealing his true motives for killing the suspect in a series of flashbacks. [[Trevor Howard]] and [[Vivien Merchant]] appear in major supporting roles.\n\n==Plot ==\nDetective-Sergeant Johnson has been a police officer for 20 years and is deeply affected by the [[murder]]s, [[rape]]s, and other violent crimes he has investigated. He is plagued by images of violence and is losing his mind under the strain.\n\nHis anger surfaces while interrogating Kenneth Baxter, who is suspected of raping a young girl. By the end of the interrogation, Johnson has severely beaten Baxter who is then taken to the hospital where he later dies. Johnson is suspended for the beating and returns home for the night, getting into a violent argument with his wife Maureen.

During their long confrontation, [[flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]] show the events of the previous night, when Johnson beats Baxter.\n\nThe flashbacks portray Baxter - whose guilt or innocence is left ambiguous - taunting Johnson, insinuating that he secretly wants to commit the sort of [[sex crime]]s he investigates. Johnson at first flies into a rage and strikes Baxter, but he eventually admits that he does indeed harbour obsessive fantasies of murder and rape. He then tearfully begs Baxter to help him. When Baxter recoils from him in disgust, Johnson snaps and kills him.\n\nThe film ends with another flashback, this time of Johnson attacking the police officers who pulled him off Baxter, and muttering \"God...my God...\" as he realises what he has done.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sean Connery]] - Johnson\n*[[Trevor Howard]] - Cartwright\n*[[Vivien Merchant]] - Maureen\n*[[Ian Bannen]] - Baxter\n*[[Peter Bowles]] - Cameron\n*[[Derek Newark]] - Jessard\n*[[Ronald Radd]] - Lawson\n*[[John Hallam]] - Panton\n*[[Richard Moore (actor)|Richard Moore]] - Garrett\n*[[Anthony Sagar]] - Hill\n*[[Maxine Gordon]] - Janie\n*[[Hilda Fenemore]] - woman on common  \n*Rhoda Lewis - woman at school  \n*Cynthia Lund - child at school  \n*[[Howard Goorney]] - Lambert\n\n==Production==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nWhen Connery agreed to return as [[James Bond]] in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', [[David V.

Lumet was keen to work with Connery again and accepted. Ian Bannen, who had also appeared in ''The Hill'' was hired as co-star.<ref>http://screenanarchy.com/2015/05/learning-from-the-masters-of-cinema-sidney-lumets-the-offence.html</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on a small budget of \u00a3385,000 in March and April 1972 in and around [[Bracknell]], [[Berkshire]] - notably the [[Wildridings]] Mill Pond area and [[Easthampstead]]'s Point Royal.

It was a critical success but a commercial failure and did not yield a profit for nine years,<ref name=\"bray\" /> even going unreleased in several markets, including [[France]], where it did not premiere until 2007. United Artists pulled out of the deal and the other project, a film version of ''[[Macbeth]]'' that Connery was to direct, was scotched by [[Roman Polanski]]'s [[Macbeth (1971 film)|adaptation]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{blockquote|\"A fascinating look at the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] based on ''[[Z-Cars|Z Cars]]'' scriptwriter John Hopkins acclaimed stage play ''This Story of Yours'', ''The Offence'' is an expertly crafted study of [[evil]] and human weakness that demands to be watched in its entirety. ''[...]'' it still packs quite a punch and features compelling performances from both Sean Connery and Ian Bannen.\"|Britmovie}}\n\n{{blockquote|\"Less well-known than his other British pictures (''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'', ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''), this unrelentingly somber policier inaugurates a newfound force in Lumet\u2019s work. The story, adapted by John Hopkins from his play, abounds in stylistic tics (recurring visual [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, various events replayed several times, [[color coding]]), but the flashiness that pockmarked much of the director\u2019s earlier work has been pruned to hushed, concentrated intensity. Likewise, the movie looks ahead to the bathed-in-gray themes of Lumet\u2019s later studies of law & order ambivalence -- Connery\u2019s pressure-cooker copper, plagued with lurid images palpitating inside his brain, is the template for the protagonists of ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Prince of the City]]'' and ''[[Q&A (film)|Q & A]]''. Connery pinpoints some fantastic shadings of bullying, dissatisfaction and self-disgust, matched by Bannen\u2019s peerless razzing &mdash; the culminating pounding is less liberating purgation than guilt transference, christened by Bannen\u2019s bloodied leer.\"|Fernando F. Croce, Cinepassion}}\n\n==DVD releases==\nIn 2004, [[MGM]] [[UK]] released a [[DVD]] of the film which contained no extras or trailers. Simultaneous releases from MGM were made in other [[PAL]] format countries, such as [[Germany]] and [[Australia]]. On 20 October 2008, the film was again released on DVD in the UK by [[Optimum Releasing]], again without extras or trailers. A French [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD, preserving the film's original ratio of 1:1.66, became available in 2009.

Ian Bannen, who had also appeared in ''The Hill'' was hired as co-star.<ref>http://screenanarchy.com/2015/05/learning-from-the-masters-of-cinema-sidney-lumets-the-offence.html</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on a small budget of \u00a3385,000 in March and April 1972 in and around [[Bracknell]], [[Berkshire]] - notably the [[Wildridings]] Mill Pond area and [[Easthampstead]]'s Point Royal. Interior sets were filmed at Twickenham Studios.<ref name=\"bray\" /> The fight sequences between Connery and Bannen were choreographed, uncredited, by [[Bob Simmons (stunt man)|Bob Simmons]], who had designed similar action scenes for the Bond films. The film remains Sir [[Harrison Birtwistle]]'s only film score.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=T83Z0vkHWBcC&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=tantallon+films#v=onepage&q=tantallon%20films&f=false |title = The Films of Sean Connery|isbn = 9780806522234|last1 = Pfeiffer|first1 = Lee|last2 = Lisa|first2 = Philip|year = 2001}}</ref>\n\nUnited Artists released ''The Offence'' early in 1973. It was a critical success but a commercial failure and did not yield a profit for nine years,<ref name=\"bray\" /> even going unreleased in several markets, including [[France]], where it did not premiere until 2007. United Artists pulled out of the deal and the other project, a film version of ''[[Macbeth]]'' that Connery was to direct, was scotched by [[Roman Polanski]]'s [[Macbeth (1971 film)|adaptation]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{blockquote|\"A fascinating look at the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] based on ''[[Z-Cars|Z Cars]]'' scriptwriter John Hopkins acclaimed stage play ''This Story of Yours'', ''The Offence'' is an expertly crafted study of [[evil]] and human weakness that demands to be watched in its entirety. ''[...]'' it still packs quite a punch and features compelling performances from both Sean Connery and Ian Bannen.\"|Britmovie}}\n\n{{blockquote|\"Less well-known than his other British pictures (''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'', ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'', ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''), this unrelentingly somber policier inaugurates a newfound force in Lumet\u2019s work. The story, adapted by John Hopkins from his play, abounds in stylistic tics (recurring visual [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, various events replayed several times, [[color coding]]), but the flashiness that pockmarked much of the director\u2019s earlier work has been pruned to hushed, concentrated intensity. Likewise, the movie looks ahead to the bathed-in-gray themes of Lumet\u2019s later studies of law & order ambivalence -- Connery\u2019s pressure-cooker copper, plagued with lurid images palpitating inside his brain, is the template for the protagonists of ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Prince of the City]]'' and ''[[Q&A (film)|Q & A]]''. Connery pinpoints some fantastic shadings of bullying, dissatisfaction and self-disgust, matched by Bannen\u2019s peerless razzing &mdash; the culminating pounding is less liberating purgation than guilt transference, christened by Bannen\u2019s bloodied leer.\"|Fernando F. Croce, Cinepassion}}\n\n==DVD releases==\nIn 2004, [[MGM]] [[UK]] released a [[DVD]] of the film which contained no extras or trailers. Simultaneous releases from MGM were made in other [[PAL]] format countries, such as [[Germany]] and [[Australia]]. On 20 October 2008, the film was again released on DVD in the UK by [[Optimum Releasing]], again without extras or trailers. A French [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD, preserving the film's original ratio of 1:1.66, became available in 2009. In April 2010, MGM put the film out on a U.S. DVD-R \"on demand\" for the first time. It is available as an exclusive from Amazon.com and contains no extras.\n\nIn 2014 the film was released on [[Blu-ray]] in the US, and in 2015 it was released in the UK in the same format.\n\n==This Story of Yours==\n[[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' original play, ''This Story of Yours'', takes the form of three duologues between Johnson and, in Act One, Maureen, then Cartwright in Act Two and Baxter in Act Three. Directed by [[Christopher Morahan]], it opened at London's [[Royal Court Theatre]] on 11 December 1968. The cast was as follows:<ref>''Who's Who in the Theatre'' (15th edition), Pitman Publishing, London 1972, page 155</ref>\n\n*Johnson - [[Michael Bryant (actor)|Michael Bryant]]\n*Maureen - [[Alethea Charlton]]\n*Cartwright - [[John Phillips (actor)|John Phillips]]\n*Baxter - [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]]\n*Policemen - Edward Clayton, Steven Barnes, Oliver Maguire, Colin Pinney\n\nThe first major revival of the play was directed by [[Jack Gold]] at London's [[Hampstead Theatre]], opening on 5 February 1987 with the following cast:<ref>''This Story of Yours'' a play by John Hopkins / Hampstead Theatre: programme by Stilwell Darby & Co Ltd: '1987 no 7'</ref>\n\n*Johnson - [[David Suchet]]\n*Maureen - Jane Wood\n*Cartwright - [[Bryan Pringle]]\n*Baxter - [[James Hazeldine]]\n*Det Sgt Jessard - Richard Cubison\n*Police Constables - Paul Fryer, Frederick Lane\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0070468|title=The Offence}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|offence}}\n* [http://www.ecranlarge.com/movie_video-view-4438-831.php Original theatrical trailer] for ''The Offence''\n\n{{John Hopkins}}\n{{Sidney Lumet}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Offence, The}}\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1970s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sidney Lumet]]\n[[Category:Films about child sexual abuse]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Hopkins]]\n\n[[ru:\u041e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Offence"}
