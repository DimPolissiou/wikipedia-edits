They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] the school's First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] that continue to have bumps. Shrewsbury and Eton both race bumps in fours whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.\n\n=== Running ===\nThe Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt (RSSH or \"the Hunt\") is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records (the Hound Books) going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Roger|date=December 1998|title=On the Scent of History|journal=Running Times|page=28}}</ref> The sport of \"the Hunt\" or \"the Hounds\", now known as a [[Paper Chase (game)|Paper Chase]], was formalised at the school around 1800. Two runners (the \"foxes\") made a trail with paper shreds and after a set time they would be pursued by the other runners (the \"hounds\"). The club officers are the Huntsman and Senior and Junior Whips.

They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] the school's First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] that continue to have bumps. Shrewsbury and Eton both race bumps in fours whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.\n\n=== Running ===\nThe Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt (RSSH or \"the Hunt\") is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records (the Hound Books) going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Roger|date=December 1998|title=On the Scent of History|journal=Running Times|page=28}}</ref> The sport of \"the Hunt\" or \"the Hounds\", now known as a [[Paper Chase (game)|Paper Chase]], was formalised at the school around 1800.
