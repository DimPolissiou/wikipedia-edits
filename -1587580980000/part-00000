Initially, a small mining town, the city has changed noticeably both in its appearance and economic focus. Issaquah was originally developed to service the mining industry (on the two nearby mountains that now lend their names to the [[Cougar/Squak Corridor Park]]), and began as the town of \"Gilman\". As the mining deposits neared depletion in the late 1890s, other companies started to realize Issaquah's potential to support a lucrative lumber business. These companies exported timber from Issaquah and other small, local towns to Seattle and larger, rapidly growing communities throughout western Washington. These early boom industries, however, faded into a period of relative quiet by the time of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. The town remained fairly placid through the succeeding decades, with [[Boeing]] providing the majority of employment in the area. [[Microsoft]] and other technological industries moved into [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] and other cities in the area, and later established operations in Issaquah itself. Both Boeing and Microsoft have significantly affected Issaquah's history, cultural development, and diverse population through their active community participation and attraction of outside residents. In June 1996, [[Costco]] moved its global headquarters to Issaquah from nearby [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]].\n\nOther Issaquah employers include [[Siemens Medical Solutions]]' Ultrasound Group, [[GoldSim| GoldSim Technology Group]], Overtime Technologies, Boehm's Candies, and [[Darigold]].\n\n==Geography==\nIssaquah is located {{convert|15|mi|km}} east-southeast of [[Seattle]] at the south end of [[Lake Sammamish]]. Its neighboring cities are [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] to the west and [[Sammamish, Washington|Sammamish]] to the north.

A trial operation took place in 2001\u201302, giving public rides in a trolley car borrowed from [[Yakima Electric Railway Museum|Yakima Valley Trolleys]]. By 2010, the Issaquah Historical Society had acquired three trolleys of its own, but the planned service had not yet begun operation, as two of the cars were [[narrow gauge]], making them incompatible with the [[standard gauge]] rails left in Issaquah, and all three were not in operating condition. A federal transportation grant was obtained, providing funds for track evaluation and repairs, and in 2012 one of the two narrow gauge cars was sent to the [[Gomaco Trolley Company]] to be refurbished and regauged to standard gauge.<ref name=\"supporters prepare\">{{cite news|last=Kagarise|first=Warren|title=Trolley returns, and supporters prepare for rides to start in October|newspaper=[[Issaquah Press]]|date=August 28, 2012|url=http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/08/28/trolley-returns-and-supporters-prepare-for-rides-to-start-in-october/|accessdate=January 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819012315/http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/08/28/trolley-returns-and-supporters-prepare-for-rides-to-start-in-october/|archivedate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>  The overhauled trolley car, ex-[[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon]] 519, returned to Issaquah in August 2012, and regular public rides began in October 2012.<ref name=\"starts service\">{{cite news|author=Issaquah Press Staff|title=All aboard, Issaquah, as downtown trolley starts service|newspaper=[[Issaquah Press]]|date=October 16, 2012|url=http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/10/16/downtown-trolley-starts-service/|accessdate=January 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819012250/http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/10/16/downtown-trolley-starts-service/|archive-date=August 19, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Operation is expected to be seasonal and on weekends only.\n\nSome proponents of the Trolley Project hope to see trolley service extended to a northern re-extension of removed track to the southern tip of Lake Sammamish or beyond to downtown Redmond by reinstalling the track along the eastern shore of Lake Sammamish that the county removed several years ago.

It is initiated by a parade, celebrates the return of the salmon to their birth waters, and praises Issaquah's history, culture, and ethnic diversity. This free festival encompasses several arts and crafts conventions, attracting many Northwest artists; these artisans feature wood, glass, jewelry, paintings, pottery and metal artworks for sale in booths spread all across the downtown and historic area. There are four stages for entertainment such as live music. Sporting events include 5&nbsp;km/10&nbsp;km runs (and a 3&nbsp;km run for children), a [[fencing]] invitational, bike rides, and a golf tournament. Memorial Field, adjacent to the city hall, hosts a \"Field of Fun\" providing free entertainment for children of all ages, thanks to the many festival sponsors. Visitors are encouraged to visit the newly restored Salmon Hatchery to view the returning salmon in close detail. In 2005, the register revealed over 400,000 people attended the Salmon Days Festival.\n\n===Cougar Mountain Zoo===\n[[File:Lake Sammamish from Cougar Mountain Zoo panorama 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of Lake Sammamish from the zoo]]\n\nThe [[Cougar Mountain Zoo]] is located on the north slope of [[Cougar Mountain]], just to the west of Issaquah. This {{convert|8|acre|m2|adj=on}} zoo offers a glimpse at many [[endangered species]] from across the globe, including many endangered birds from around the world and small lemurs from Madagascar. The highlight of the zoo for many observers is the [[cougar]], named Nashi. Nashi is provided enrichment on a near-daily basis, which consists of a stimulant to keep him active mentally and physically. The zoo currently specializes in eight \"worlds\" of animals: cougars, lemurs, cranes, reindeer, macaws, wallabies, ratites, camelids.\n\nOn June 16, 2007, another world was added to the list, when the zoo welcomed its newest members, two male tiger cubs. Named Taj and Almos, they are the only [[Bengal tiger|Bengal]] tigers in Washington state. The Zoo is open for general admission Wednesday through Sunday, 9&nbsp;a.m. to 5&nbsp;p.m. (excluding the month of December). Each December the Zoo also offers a special [[Reindeer]] Festival, during which people may come view, and feed [[Santa Claus|Santa's]] Reindeer, and visit the \"big guy\" in person.\n\n===Issaquah Salmon Hatchery===\nThe Issaquah Salmon Hatchery was built in 1936 under the federal [[Works Project Administration]]. It is located on the [[Issaquah Creek]] within the city limits of Issaquah.

Friends of the Issaquah Salmon Hatchery (FISH) is a non-profit organization that trains volunteer guides who lead free educational tours of the hatchery and advocates retaining and improving the historic hatchery. Local elementary schools often raise small numbers of salmon eggs that are spawned in the hatchery and release them into the creeks as part of their science curriculum on the salmon life cycle. The Issaquah Salmon Hatchery is located in the cultural and geographical heart of Issaquah and is the Department of Fish and Wildlife's most visited hatchery, with an estimated 350,000 visitors a year.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=August 22, 2015|title=FISH: Mission|url=http://www.issaquahfish.org/about-fish/mission/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009025936/http://www.issaquahfish.org/about-fish/mission/|archive-date=October 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Gilman Village===\n[[Image:XXX Root Beer Restaurant Issaquah WA 2000px.jpg|right|thumb|upright|XXX Root Beer restaurant, one of two remaining locations]]\nGilman Village is a specialty shopping center created from rescued buildings dating back to the origins of the Issaquah community. Gilman Village was founded in 1972, when developers Marvin and Ruth Mohl started saving old, unwanted farming and mining buildings, as well as pioneer homes, from around Issaquah. They moved, renovated and combined them into an attractive retail area in a park-like setting. Their goal was to create a haven for independent shops and restaurants. In saving the buildings, the intent was to honor the character and ambiance of the old community rather than to create a museum. Still, the buildings that house the shops and restaurants of Gilman Village represent a significant portion of Issaquah's history.\n\nThe 40-plus shops and restaurants that make up Gilman Village became one of Puget Sound's best known{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and most distinctive shopping destinations. In its initial decades, Gilman Village was a destination while Issaquah was still a somewhat rural area. Over time, Gilman Village began to compete with other local shopping centers for tenants serving the Issaquah population.<ref name=\"gilman\">{{cite news|url=http://www.issaquah360.com/its-time-to-give-gilman-village-another-look/ | title=It's Time to Give Gilman Village Another Look | publisher=Blue Jacket | date=April 1, 2013 | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDesigners of Gilman Village have included the Baylis Architects, Richard Haag Associates and landscape architect Stephen G. Ray. Their combined efforts have won official recognition by the King County Board of Realtors in 1976 and the Issaquah Design Commission in 1977 for quality of design and landscaping. In 1985, The Bellevue Chamber of Commerce presented the Eastside Quality of Life Award to Gilman Village for \"the pleasures it gives through its rich discoveries of space and forms\".\n\n===Flight===\n[[Paragliding|Paragliders]] and [[hang gliders]] launch from [[Tiger Mountain (Washington)|Tiger Mountain]] in Issaquah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwparagliding.com/PilotInfo/TigerMountain/tabid/236/Default.aspx|title=Tiger Mountain|publisher=Northwest Paragliding Club.|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[Swedish Medical Center]] opened a full service hospital and healthcare facility in the Issaquah Highlands with a capacity of 175 inpatient beds and a 24-hour emergency room in 2012.<ref>[http://www.swedish.org/Locations/Issaquah-Campus Swedish Medical Center Seattle \u2013 Issaquah Campus].

Three of the laborers died from gunshot wounds, and none of the attackers were convicted of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe city was officially incorporated on April 29, 1892. Initially a small mining town, the city has changed noticeably both in its appearance and economic focus. Issaquah was originally developed to service the mining industry (on the two nearby mountains that now lend their names to the [[Cougar/Squak Corridor Park]]), and began as the town of \"Gilman\". As the mining deposits neared depletion in the late 1890s, other companies started to realize Issaquah's potential to support a lucrative lumber business. These companies exported timber from Issaquah and other small, local towns to Seattle and larger, rapidly growing communities throughout western Washington. These early boom industries, however, faded into a period of relative quiet by the time of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. The town remained fairly placid through the succeeding decades, with [[Boeing]] providing the majority of employment in the area. [[Microsoft]] and other technological industries moved into [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] and other cities in the area, and later established operations in Issaquah itself. Both Boeing and Microsoft have significantly affected Issaquah's history, cultural development, and diverse population through their active community participation and attraction of outside residents. In June 1996, [[Costco]] moved its global headquarters to Issaquah from nearby [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]].\n\nOther Issaquah employers include [[Siemens Medical Solutions]]' Ultrasound Group, [[GoldSim| GoldSim Technology Group]], Overtime Technologies, Boehm's Candies, and [[Darigold]].\n\n==Geography==\nIssaquah is located {{convert|15|mi|km}} east-southeast of [[Seattle]] at the south end of [[Lake Sammamish]]. Its neighboring cities are [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] to the west and [[Sammamish, Washington|Sammamish]] to the north.

A trial operation took place in 2001\u201302, giving public rides in a trolley car borrowed from [[Yakima Electric Railway Museum|Yakima Valley Trolleys]]. By 2010, the Issaquah Historical Society had acquired three trolleys of its own, but the planned service had not yet begun operation, as two of the cars were [[narrow gauge]], making them incompatible with the [[standard gauge]] rails left in Issaquah, and all three were not in operating condition. A federal transportation grant was obtained, providing funds for track evaluation and repairs, and in 2012 one of the two narrow gauge cars was sent to the [[Gomaco Trolley Company]] to be refurbished and regauged to standard gauge.<ref name=\"supporters prepare\">{{cite news|last=Kagarise|first=Warren|title=Trolley returns, and supporters prepare for rides to start in October|newspaper=[[Issaquah Press]]|date=August 28, 2012|url=http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/08/28/trolley-returns-and-supporters-prepare-for-rides-to-start-in-october/|accessdate=January 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819012315/http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/08/28/trolley-returns-and-supporters-prepare-for-rides-to-start-in-october/|archivedate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>  The overhauled trolley car, ex-[[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon]] 519, returned to Issaquah in August 2012, and regular public rides began in October 2012.<ref name=\"starts service\">{{cite news|author=Issaquah Press Staff|title=All aboard, Issaquah, as downtown trolley starts service|newspaper=[[Issaquah Press]]|date=October 16, 2012|url=http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/10/16/downtown-trolley-starts-service/|accessdate=January 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819012250/http://www.issaquahpress.com/2012/10/16/downtown-trolley-starts-service/|archive-date=August 19, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Operation is expected to be seasonal and on weekends only.\n\nSome proponents of the Trolley Project hope to see trolley service extended to a northern re-extension of removed track to the southern tip of Lake Sammamish or beyond to downtown Redmond by reinstalling the track along the eastern shore of Lake Sammamish that the county removed several years ago.

It is initiated by a parade, celebrates the return of the salmon to their birth waters, and praises Issaquah's history, culture, and ethnic diversity. This free festival encompasses several arts and crafts conventions, attracting many Northwest artists; these artisans feature wood, glass, jewelry, paintings, pottery and metal artworks for sale in booths spread all across the downtown and historic area. There are four stages for entertainment such as live music. Sporting events include 5&nbsp;km/10&nbsp;km runs (and a 3&nbsp;km run for children), a [[fencing]] invitational, bike rides, and a golf tournament. Memorial Field, adjacent to the city hall, hosts a \"Field of Fun\" providing free entertainment for children of all ages, thanks to the many festival sponsors. Visitors are encouraged to visit the newly restored Salmon Hatchery to view the returning salmon in close detail. In 2005, the register revealed over 400,000 people attended the Salmon Days Festival.\n\n===Cougar Mountain Zoo===\n[[File:Lake Sammamish from Cougar Mountain Zoo panorama 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of Lake Sammamish from the zoo]]\n\nThe [[Cougar Mountain Zoo]] is located on the north slope of [[Cougar Mountain]], just to the west of Issaquah. This {{convert|8|acre|m2|adj=on}} zoo offers a glimpse at many [[endangered species]] from across the globe, including many endangered birds from around the world and small lemurs from Madagascar. The highlight of the zoo for many observers is the [[cougar]], named Nashi. Nashi is provided enrichment on a near-daily basis, which consists of a stimulant to keep him active mentally and physically. The zoo currently specializes in eight \"worlds\" of animals: cougars, lemurs, cranes, reindeer, macaws, wallabies, ratites, camelids.\n\nOn June 16, 2007, another world was added to the list, when the zoo welcomed its newest members, two male tiger cubs. Named Taj and Almos, they are the only [[Bengal tiger|Bengal]] tigers in Washington state. The Zoo is open for general admission Wednesday through Sunday, 9&nbsp;a.m. to 5&nbsp;p.m. (excluding the month of December). Each December the Zoo also offers a special [[Reindeer]] Festival, during which people may come view, and feed [[Santa Claus|Santa's]] Reindeer, and visit the \"big guy\" in person.\n\n===Issaquah Salmon Hatchery===\nThe Issaquah Salmon Hatchery was built in 1936 under the federal [[Works Project Administration]]. It is located on the [[Issaquah Creek]] within the city limits of Issaquah.

Friends of the Issaquah Salmon Hatchery (FISH) is a non-profit organization that trains volunteer guides who lead free educational tours of the hatchery and advocates retaining and improving the historic hatchery. Local elementary schools often raise small numbers of salmon eggs that are spawned in the hatchery and release them into the creeks as part of their science curriculum on the salmon life cycle. The Issaquah Salmon Hatchery is located in the cultural and geographical heart of Issaquah and is the Department of Fish and Wildlife's most visited hatchery, with an estimated 350,000 visitors a year.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=August 22, 2015|title=FISH: Mission|url=http://www.issaquahfish.org/about-fish/mission/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009025936/http://www.issaquahfish.org/about-fish/mission/|archive-date=October 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Gilman Village===\n[[Image:XXX Root Beer Restaurant Issaquah WA 2000px.jpg|right|thumb|upright|XXX Root Beer restaurant, one of two remaining locations]]\nGilman Village is a specialty shopping center created from rescued buildings dating back to the origins of the Issaquah community. Gilman Village was founded in 1972, when developers Marvin and Ruth Mohl started saving old, unwanted farming and mining buildings, as well as pioneer homes, from around Issaquah. They moved, renovated and combined them into an attractive retail area in a park-like setting. Their goal was to create a haven for independent shops and restaurants. In saving the buildings, the intent was to honor the character and ambiance of the old community rather than to create a museum. Still, the buildings that house the shops and restaurants of Gilman Village represent a significant portion of Issaquah's history.\n\nThe 40-plus shops and restaurants that make up Gilman Village became one of Puget Sound's best known{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and most distinctive shopping destinations. In its initial decades, Gilman Village was a destination while Issaquah was still a somewhat rural area. Over time, Gilman Village began to compete with other local shopping centers for tenants serving the Issaquah population.<ref name=\"gilman\">{{cite news|url=http://www.issaquah360.com/its-time-to-give-gilman-village-another-look/ | title=It's Time to Give Gilman Village Another Look | publisher=Blue Jacket | date=April 1, 2013 | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDesigners of Gilman Village have included the Baylis Architects, Richard Haag Associates and landscape architect Stephen G. Ray. Their combined efforts have won official recognition by the King County Board of Realtors in 1976 and the Issaquah Design Commission in 1977 for quality of design and landscaping. In 1985, The Bellevue Chamber of Commerce presented the Eastside Quality of Life Award to Gilman Village for \"the pleasures it gives through its rich discoveries of space and forms\".\n\n===Flight===\n[[Paragliding|Paragliders]] and [[hang gliders]] launch from [[Tiger Mountain (Washington)|Tiger Mountain]] in Issaquah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwparagliding.com/PilotInfo/TigerMountain/tabid/236/Default.aspx|title=Tiger Mountain|publisher=Northwest Paragliding Club.|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[Swedish Medical Center]] opened a full service hospital and healthcare facility in the Issaquah Highlands with a capacity of 175 inpatient beds and a 24-hour emergency room in 2012.<ref>[http://www.swedish.org/Locations/Issaquah-Campus Swedish Medical Center Seattle \u2013 Issaquah Campus].

It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker.&nbsp;...<br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"G9a reverses \u0394FosB plasticity\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

In this way, the induction of CDK5 gene expression occurs together with suppression of the G9A gene coding for dimethyltransferase acting on the histone H3. A feedback mechanism can be observed in the regulation of these 2 crucial factors that determine the adaptive epigenetic response to cocaine. This depends on \u0394FosB inhibiting G9a gene expression, i.e. H3K9me2 synthesis which in turn inhibits transcription factors for \u0394FosB.

EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten & Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker & Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&nbsp;...<br />EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn\u2019t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&nbsp;...

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&nbsp;...<br />In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior.

One reason for this may be that the case is due to a focus of current research on common variants. Many addiction studies focus on common variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% in the general population; however, when associated with disease, these only confer a small amount of additional risk with an odds ratio of 1.1\u20131.3 percent.

These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This is not to say that previous findings, or the GWAS findings, are erroneous.

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&nbsp;...

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.<br />Cue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS<br />A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS.

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\"wanting\") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. }}</ref><ref name=\"Amphetamine epigenetics\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCowan TJ, Dhasarathy A, Carvelli L | title = The Epigenetic Mechanisms of Amphetamine | journal = J.

Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH.

Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation. Our present findings thus demonstrate clear cross talk among histone PTMs and suggest that decreased behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants following prolonged HDAC inhibition might be mediated through decreased activity of HDAC1 at H3K9 KMT promoters and subsequent increases in H3K9me2 and gene repression.}}<br />{{bull}}{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon-O'Brien E, Alaux-Cantin S, Warnault V, Buttolo R, Naassila M, Vilpoux C | title = The histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate decreases excessive ethanol intake in dependent animals | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 676\u201389 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25041570 | doi = 10.1111/adb.12161 | quote = Altogether, our results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of {{abbr|NaB|sodium butyrate}} in preventing excessive ethanol intake and relapse and support the hypothesis that {{abbr|HDACi|HDAC inhibitors}} may have a potential use in alcohol addiction treatment.}}<br />{{bull}}{{cite journal | vauthors = Castino MR, Cornish JL, Clemens KJ | title = Inhibition of histone deacetylases facilitates extinction and attenuates reinstatement of nicotine self-administration in rats | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = e0124796 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25880762 | pmc = 4399837 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0124796 | quote = treatment with NaB significantly attenuated nicotine and nicotine + cue reinstatement when administered immediately&nbsp;...

Decreasing HDAC2 reverses both the molecular and behavioral consequences of alcohol addiction, thus implicating this enzyme as a potential treatment target (Fig. 3). HDAC2 is also crucial for the induction and maintenance of structural synaptic plasticity in other neurological domains such as memory formation [115]. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential usefulness of HDAC inhibition in treating alcohol use disorders&nbsp;... Given the ability of HDAC inhibitors to potently modulate the synaptic plasticity of learning and memory [118], these drugs hold potential as treatment for substance abuse-related disorders.&nbsp;... Our lab and others have published extensively on the ability of HDAC inhibitors to reverse the gene expression deficits caused by multiple models of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, the results of which were discussed above [25,112,113].

It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker.&nbsp;...<br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"G9a reverses \u0394FosB plasticity\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bili\u0144ski P, Wojty\u0142a A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studzi\u0144ski T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten & Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker & Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo & Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&nbsp;...<br />EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn\u2019t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&nbsp;...

Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group.

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&nbsp;...

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.<br />Cue-triggered \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS<br />A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS.

This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience&nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed \u2018wanting\u2019 \u2013 CS-triggered pulses of intensified \u2018wanting\u2019 for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed \u2018wanting\u2019 \u2013 motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}}) that is assigned by the brain to a rewarding stimulus (e.g., a drug).

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (\"wanting\") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}}</ref><ref name=\"Incentive salience and motivation review\" /><ref name=\"Reinforcement in addiction\" /> Reward sensitization normally occurs following chronically high levels of exposure to the stimulus.

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. }}</ref><ref name=\"Amphetamine epigenetics\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCowan TJ, Dhasarathy A, Carvelli L | title = The Epigenetic Mechanisms of Amphetamine | journal = J.

Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH.

The effects of pharmacological inhibition of HDACs on psychostimulant-induced plasticity appear to depend on the timecourse of HDAC inhibition. Studies employing co-administration procedures in which inhibitors are given acutely, just prior to psychostimulant administration, report heightened behavioral responses to the drug<sup>1,3,4,13,14</sup>. In contrast, experimental paradigms like the one employed here, in which HDAC inhibitors are administered more chronically, for several days prior to psychostimulant exposure, show inhibited expression<sup>3</sup> or decreased acquisition of behavioral adaptations to drug<sup>5,11,12</sup>. The clustering of seemingly discrepant results based on experimental methodologies is interesting in light of our present findings. Both HDAC inhibitors and psychostimulants increase global levels of histone acetylation in NAc. Thus, when co-administered acutely, these drugs may have synergistic effects, leading to heightened transcriptional activation of psychostimulant-regulated target genes. In contrast, when a psychostimulant is given in the context of prolonged, HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation, homeostatic processes may direct AcH3 binding to the promoters of genes (e.g., G9a) responsible for inducing chromatin condensation and gene repression (e.g., via H3K9me2) in order to dampen already heightened transcriptional activation.

Decreasing HDAC2 reverses both the molecular and behavioral consequences of alcohol addiction, thus implicating this enzyme as a potential treatment target (Fig. 3). HDAC2 is also crucial for the induction and maintenance of structural synaptic plasticity in other neurological domains such as memory formation [115]. Taken together, these findings underscore the potential usefulness of HDAC inhibition in treating alcohol use disorders&nbsp;... Given the ability of HDAC inhibitors to potently modulate the synaptic plasticity of learning and memory [118], these drugs hold potential as treatment for substance abuse-related disorders.&nbsp;... Our lab and others have published extensively on the ability of HDAC inhibitors to reverse the gene expression deficits caused by multiple models of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, the results of which were discussed above [25,112,113]. This data supports further examination of histone modifying agents as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of alcohol addiction&nbsp;...
