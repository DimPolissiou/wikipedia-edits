He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the [[Short Parliament|Short]] (1640) and [[Long Parliament|Long]] (1640\u20131649) Parliaments. He entered the [[English Civil War]]s on the side of the \"[[Roundheads]]\" or Parliamentarians, nicknamed \"Old [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]]\". He demonstrated his ability as a commander and was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to being one of the principal commanders of the [[New Model Army]], playing an important role under General Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] in the defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalist (\"Cavalier\")]] forces.\n\nCromwell was one of the signatories of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s death warrant in 1649, and he dominated the short-lived [[Commonwealth of England]] as a member of the [[Rump Parliament]] (1649\u20131653). He was selected to take command of the English campaign in Ireland in 1649\u20131650. Cromwell's forces defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. During this period, a series of [[Penal Laws]] were passed against Roman Catholics (a significant minority in England and Scotland but the vast majority in Ireland), and a substantial amount of their land was confiscated. Cromwell also led a campaign against the Scottish army between 1650 and 1651.\n\nOn 20 April 1653, he dismissed the Rump Parliament by force, setting up a short-lived nominated assembly known as [[Barebone's Parliament]] before being invited by his fellow leaders to rule as [[Lord Protector]] of England (which included Wales at the time), Scotland, and Ireland from 16 December 1653.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cromwell_oliver.shtml|title=Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658)}}</ref> As a ruler, he executed an aggressive and effective foreign policy.

For several generations, the Williamses added the surname of Cromwell to their own, styling themselves \"Williams alias Cromwell\" in legal documents ({{harvnb|Noble|1784|pp=11\u201313}})}} then to Oliver's father Robert Williams, alias Cromwell (c. 1560\u20131617), who married Elizabeth Steward (c. 1564 \u2013 1654), probably in 1591.

The marriage brought Cromwell into contact with [[Oliver St John]] and with leading members of the London merchant community, and behind them the influence of the Earls of [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|Holland]]. A place in this influential network would prove crucial to Cromwell's military and political career.

His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morrill, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the [[Huntingdonshire]] [[county town]] of [[Huntingdon]]. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including ''valde melancholicus'' (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]]. In 1629 he was caught up in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1630.<ref>Morrill, pp.&nbsp;24\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell's House]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]\n\nIn 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon\u2014probably as a result of the dispute\u2014and moved to a farmstead in nearby [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] (then in Huntingdonshire, now in Cambridgeshire). This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact. A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening. The letter outlines how, having been \"the chief of sinners\", Cromwell had been called to be among \"the congregation of the firstborn\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> It would appear that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to [[Connecticut]] in America, but was prevented by the government from leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml|title=A unique leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around \u00a3300\u2013400 per year;<ref>Gaunt, p.34.</ref> by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]].<ref name=bcw>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/oliver-cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament: 1628\u201329 and 1640\u20131642==\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628\u20131629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received.<ref>Morrill, pp.25\u201326.</ref> After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973</ref>\n\nA second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628\u201329, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a Puritan [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]].<ref>Adamson, John (1990). \"Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament\", in Morrill, p. 57.</ref> At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]].<ref>Adamson, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Military commander: 1642\u20131646==\n\n===English Civil War begins===\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the [[English Civil War]]. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in [[East Anglia]] in 1643, notably at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lincolnshire.htm#gainsborough |title=1643: Civil War in Lincolnshire |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}</ref> He was subsequently appointed governor of the [[Isle of Ely]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elystandard.co.uk/ely-life/fenland-riots-as-country-slides-into-civil-war-1-258647|title=Fenland riots|website=www.elystandard.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> and a [[colonel]] in the Eastern Association.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n=== Marston Moor 1644 ===\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] of horse in Manchester's army. The success of his cavalry in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment during the battle but returning to help force the victory.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], London 1973, {{ISBN|0297765566}}, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], pp. 120\u2013129.</ref> After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor he wrote a famous letter to his [[Valentine Walton|brother-in-law]]. Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians, but failed to end Royalist resistance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/battle-of-marston-moor|publisher=British Civil Wars| title=The Battle of Marston Moor| accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe indecisive outcome of the [[Second Battle of Newbury]] in October meant that by the end of 1644 the war still showed no signs of ending. Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of \"low birth\" as officers in the army, to which he replied: \"If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them&nbsp;... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else\".<ref>Letter to Sir William Spring, September 1643, quoted in Carlyle, Thomas (ed.)

This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command. All of them\u2014except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament\u2014chose to renounce their military positions. The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms. In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Battle of Naseby 1645===\n[[File:Charles Landseer Cromwell Battle of Naseby.JPG|thumb|Cromwell in the Battle of Naseby in 1645. [[Charles Landseer]].]]\nAt the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender.<ref>Kenyon, John & Ohlmeyer, Jane (eds.) (2000). ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland, and Ireland 1638\u20131660'' (Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|0-19-280278-X}}, p.141</ref> Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at [[Bridgwater]], [[Sherborne]], Bristol, [[Devizes]], and [[Winchester]], then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June 1646.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Cromwell's military style===\nCromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.<ref>[[Austin Herbert Woolrych|Woolrych, Austin]] (1990). ''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp.117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nCromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-76556-6}}, pp. 154\u2013161</ref>\n\n==Politics: 1647\u20131649==\nIn February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/news/a-lasting-place-in-history-1-377880|title=A lasting place in history|publisher=Saffron Walden Reporter|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the \"[[Heads of Proposals]]\" pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Maurice|title=The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell|year=1957|publisher=Collier- Macmillan LTD.|location=London|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> It was designed to check the powers of the [[executive branch|executive]], to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] settlement.<ref>Although there is debate over whether Cromwell and Ireton were the authors of the Heads of Proposals or acting on behalf of Saye and Sele: Adamson, John (1987). \"The English Nobility and the Projected Settlement of 1647\", in ''Historical Journal'', 30, 3; Kishlansky, Mark (1990). \"Saye What?\" in ''Historical Journal'' 33, 4.</ref>\n\nMany in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other. The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1987).

If you move it down, it breaks the line into the next topic.--->\n\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the [[Second English Civil War]] in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms. Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]. The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning. The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks. Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|title=Spartacus: Rowland Laugharne at Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025014050/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|archivedate=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nCromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England. At [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Preston]], Cromwell, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, won a decisive victory against an army twice as large.<ref>Gardiner (1901), pp.144\u201347; Gaunt (1997) 94\u201397.</ref>\n\nDuring 1648, Cromwell's letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that \"they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land\". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod.<ref>Morrill and Baker (2008), p.31.</ref> These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument.<ref>Adamson, pp.76\u201384.</ref> The episode shows Cromwell's firm belief in \"[[Providentialism]]\"\u2014that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of \"chosen people\" (whom God had \"provided\" for such purposes).

Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London.

The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller [[English Council of State|Council of State]] also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the \"Rump\" and was appointed a member of the Council. In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as \"[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]\". In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the \"[[New Model Army]]\". The \"[[Leveller]]\" or \"[[Agitator]]\" movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto \"[[Agreement of the People]]\" in 1647. Cromwell and the rest of the \"[[Grandees]]\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners. In the \"[[Putney Debates]]\" of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad. The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm |title=The Levellers |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish campaign: 1649\u201350==\n{{See also|Irish Confederate Wars|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649&ndash;50. Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\".<ref>Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000). ''Confederate Catholics at War'' ([[Cork University Press]]), {{ISBN|1-85918-244-5}}, p.115.</ref>\n\nCromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of [[Pope|papal]] and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in [[continental Europe]].<ref>Fraser, pp.74\u201376.</ref> Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (\"Gaels\")]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.326\u2013328.</ref>\n\nParliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England. At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture\u2014comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.98.</ref> Cromwell wrote afterwards that:\n\n<blockquote>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret<ref>{{cite book|last=Cromwell |first=Oliver|title=''\"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\"'' |editor=[[Thomas Carlyle]]|publisher=William H.

While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.<ref>Fraser, Antonia (1973). ''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'', and ''Cromwell: the Lord Protector'' (Phoenix Press), {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}} pp.344\u201346; and Austin Woolrych, ''Britain In Revolution'' (Oxford, 2002), p. 470</ref>\n\nAfter the taking of Drogheda, Cromwell sent a column north to [[Ulster]] to secure the north of the country and went on to [[Siege of Waterford|besiege Waterford]], [[Kilkenny]] and [[Clonmel]] in Ireland's south-east. Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.100.</ref>\n\nOne of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament.<ref>Fraser, pp.321\u2013322; Lenihan 2000, p.113.</ref> At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.<ref>Fraser, p.355.</ref>\n\nThe Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]] mostly consisted of long sieges of fortified cities and [[guerrilla warfare]] in the countryside. The last Catholic-held town, [[Galway]], surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April of the following year.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn the wake of the Commonwealth's conquest of the island of Ireland, the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.314.</ref> All Catholic-owned land was confiscated under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652]] and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament's financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur094.htm |title= Act for the Settlement of Ireland, 12 August 1652, Henry Scobell, ii. 197.

On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England.<ref>Lenihan 2000, p. 1O22; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare.

Cromwell demanded that no supplies were to be seized from the civilian inhabitants and that everything should be fairly purchased; \"I do hereby warn....all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whatsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy.....as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishhistorylinks.net/Historical_Documents/Cromwell.html|title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches II: Letters from Ireland, 1649 and 1650| first=Thomas |last=Carlyle|year= 1897 |publisher= Chapman and Hall Ltd, London|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Robert Walker.jpg|thumb|left|Oliver Cromwell {{circa|1649}} by [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]].

However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]], killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.66.</ref> The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n===Battle of Worcester===\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made a desperate attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland.

The rule of the Commonwealth and Protectorate was largely peaceful, apart from the Highlands. Moreover, there were no wholesale confiscations of land or property.

Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government.<ref>Worden, Blair (1977). ''The Rump Parliament'' (Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|0-521-29213-1}}, ch.16\u201317.</ref> Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers. Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said \"you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting\".<ref>Abbott, p.643</ref> At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the \"bauble\" be taken away.<ref>Abbott, p.642-643.</ref> His troops were commanded by [[Charles Worsley]], later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/charles-worsley|title=Charles Worsley|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Establishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653==\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]] for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of [[saint]]s. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs\u2014which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth\u2014he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Roots|1989|pp=8\u201327}} The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called [[Barebone's Parliament]] after one of its members, [[Praise-God Barebone]]. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1982).

It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake \"the chief magistracy and the administration of government\". Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia.<ref>Gaunt, p.155.</ref> However, from this point on Cromwell signed his name 'Oliver P', the ''P'' being an abbreviation for ''Protector'', which was similar to the style of monarchs who used an ''R'' to mean ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', and it soon became the norm for others to address him as \"Your Highness\".<ref>Gaunt, p.156.</ref> As Protector, he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of a Council of State. Nevertheless, Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army.

The first was \"healing and settling\" the nation after the chaos of the civil wars and the regicide, which meant establishing a stable form for the new government to take.<ref>Hirst, Derek (1990). \"The Lord Protector, 1653\u20138\", in Morrill, p.172.</ref> Although Cromwell declared to the first Protectorate Parliament that, \"Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental,\" in practice social priorities took precedence over forms of government.

Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=David Hackett |authorlink1=David Hackett Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1991 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195069051 |pages=219\u2013220 |chapter=The South of England to Virginia: Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants, 1642\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654. He declared that \"healing and settling\" were the \"great end of your meeting\".<ref>Roots 1989, pp.41\u201356.</ref> However, the Parliament was quickly dominated by those pushing for more radical, properly republican reforms. After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament's bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of \u00a3200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value in which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.<ref>Aylmer, G.E., ''Rebellion or Revolution?

He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England.<ref>Hirst, p.173.</ref> During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of \"triers\" was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of \"ejectors\" was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a [[Penruddock uprising|Royalist uprising in March 1655]], led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the Commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]\u2014instated in September 1656\u2014voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.<ref>Durston, Christopher (1998).

It was this\u2014allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside Puritanism\u2014that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]] in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Hirst, p.137.</ref> There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on [[Matthew 23]]:37\u201339 and [[Romans 11]]. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:12\u201315 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again\".<ref>Roots 1989, p.128.</ref> The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655\u2014comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.<ref>Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\", in Beales, D. and Best, G.

The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice: Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.<ref>Masson, p. 354</ref>\n\n==Death and posthumous execution==\n{{See also|Oliver Cromwell's head}}\n[[File:WarwickCastle CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Oliver Cromwell's death mask at [[Warwick Castle]]]]\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and from \"stone\" ([[kidney stone disease]]). In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the [[Doge of Venice]] in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death.{{sfn|McMains|2015|p=75}} The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter [[Elizabeth Claypole]] in August.

For example, ''The Machiavilian Cromwell'' and ''The Juglers Discovered'' are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the [[Levellers]] after 1647, and both present him as a [[Machiavelli]]an figure.<ref>Morrill, John (1990). \"Cromwell and his contemporaries\", in Morrill, pp.263\u20134.</ref> John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in ''A Warning Piece Discharged'', comparing him to [[Moses]] rescuing the English by taking them safely through the [[Red Sea]] of the civil wars.<ref>Morrill, pp.271\u20132.</ref> Poet [[John Milton]] called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his ''Sonnet XVI''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/4350/poem1456.html |title=RPO - John Milton : Sonnet XVI: To the Lord General Cromwell |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral biographies were published soon after Cromwell's death. An example is ''The Perfect Politician'', which describes how Cromwell \"loved men more than books\" and provides a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience who is brought down by pride and ambition.<ref>Morrill, pp. 279\u201381.</ref> An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] in his ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. Clarendon famously declares that Cromwell \"will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man\".<ref name=g9>Gaunt, p.9.</ref> He argues that Cromwell's rise to power had been helped by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness. Clarendon was not one of Cromwell's confidantes, and his account was written after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]].<ref name=g9/>\n\nDuring the early 18th century, Cromwell's image began to be adopted and reshaped by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy.  [[John Toland]] rewrote [[Edmund Ludlow]]'s ''Memoirs'' in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny. Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a despot who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s.<ref>Worden, Blair (2001). ''Roundhead Reputations: The English Civil Wars and the Passions of Posterity'' (Penguin), {{ISBN|0-14-100694-3}}, pp. 53\u201359</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I hope to render the English name as great and formidable as ever the Roman was.<ref>\"The Life and Eccentricities of the late Dr. Monsey, F.R.S, physician to the Royal Hospital at Chelsea\", printed by J.D.

[[Thomas Carlyle]] continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of his letters and speeches, and describing English Puritanism as \"the last of all our Heroisms\" while taking a negative view of his own era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=Thomas |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |date=December 1843 |url=http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf}}</ref> By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness. Oxford civil war historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that \"the man\u2014it is ever so with the noblest\u2014was greater than his work\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.315.</ref> Gardiner stressed Cromwell's dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell's religious conviction.<ref>Worden, pp.256\u2013260.</ref> Cromwell's foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his \"constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.318.</ref> [[Calvin Coolidge]] described Cromwell as a brilliant statesman who \"dared to oppose the tyranny of the kings.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last= Coolidge\n |first= Calvin \n |date= 1929\n |title= The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge\n |location= USA\n |publisher=\n |page= 29\n |isbn= 978-1410216229\n |author-link=\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Cromwell's reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[Italian fascism|Italy]]. Harvard historian [[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morrill |first1=John |year=1990 |title=Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell |url= |journal=Historical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=629\u2013639 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X0001356X}}</ref>\n\nLate 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime. [[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.<ref>Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in ''History'' 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, {{ISSN|0018-2648}}.</ref> Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell's writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.<ref>Morrill (2004). \"Cromwell, Oliver (1599\u20131658)\", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (Oxford University Press) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765 Oxforddnb.com]; Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\".

[[Winston Churchill]] was First Lord of the Admiralty before [[World War I]], and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS ''Oliver Cromwell''. The suggestion was vetoed by [[George V of Great Britain|King George V]] because of his personal feelings and because he felt that it was unwise to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish political unrest]], especially given the anger caused by the statue outside Parliament. Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Admiral Battenberg]] that the King's decision must be treated as final.<ref>[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'', New York: [[Alfred A.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the [[Short Parliament|Short]] (1640) and [[Long Parliament|Long]] (1640\u20131649) Parliaments. He entered the [[English Civil War]]s on the side of the \"[[Roundheads]]\" or Parliamentarians, nicknamed \"Old [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]]\". He demonstrated his ability as a commander and was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to being one of the principal commanders of the [[New Model Army]], playing an important role under General Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] in the defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalist (\"Cavalier\")]] forces.\n\nCromwell was one of the signatories of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s death warrant in 1649, and he dominated the short-lived [[Commonwealth of England]] as a member of the [[Rump Parliament]] (1649\u20131653). He was selected to take command of the English campaign in Ireland in 1649\u20131650. Cromwell's forces defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. During this period, a series of [[Penal Laws]] were passed against Roman Catholics (a significant minority in England and Scotland but the vast majority in Ireland), and a substantial amount of their land was confiscated. Cromwell also led a campaign against the Scottish army between 1650 and 1651.\n\nOn 20 April 1653, he dismissed the Rump Parliament by force, setting up a short-lived nominated assembly known as [[Barebone's Parliament]] before being invited by his fellow leaders to rule as [[Lord Protector]] of England (which included Wales at the time), Scotland, and Ireland from 16 December 1653.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cromwell_oliver.shtml|title=Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658)}}</ref> As a ruler, he executed an aggressive and effective foreign policy.

A place in this influential network would prove crucial to Cromwell's military and political career.

His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morrill, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the [[Huntingdonshire]] [[county town]] of [[Huntingdon]]. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including ''valde melancholicus'' (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]]. In 1629 he was caught up in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1630.<ref>Morrill, pp.&nbsp;24\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell's House]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]\n\nIn 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon\u2014probably as a result of the dispute\u2014and moved to a farmstead in nearby [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] (then in Huntingdonshire, now in Cambridgeshire). This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact. A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening. The letter outlines how, having been \"the chief of sinners\", Cromwell had been called to be among \"the congregation of the firstborn\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> It would appear that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to [[Connecticut]] in America, but was prevented by the government from leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml|title=A unique leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around \u00a3300\u2013400 per year;<ref>Gaunt, p.34.</ref> by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]].<ref name=bcw>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/oliver-cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament: 1628\u201329 and 1640\u20131642==\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628\u20131629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received.<ref>Morrill, pp.25\u201326.</ref> After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973</ref>\n\nA second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628\u201329, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a Puritan [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]].<ref>Adamson, John (1990). \"Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament\", in Morrill, p. 57.</ref> At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]].<ref>Adamson, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Military commander: 1642\u20131646==\n\n===English Civil War begins===\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the [[English Civil War]]. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in [[East Anglia]] in 1643, notably at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lincolnshire.htm#gainsborough |title=1643: Civil War in Lincolnshire |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}</ref> He was subsequently appointed governor of the [[Isle of Ely]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elystandard.co.uk/ely-life/fenland-riots-as-country-slides-into-civil-war-1-258647|title=Fenland riots|website=www.elystandard.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> and a [[colonel]] in the Eastern Association.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n=== Marston Moor 1644 ===\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] of horse in Manchester's army. The success of his cavalry in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment during the battle but returning to help force the victory.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], London 1973, {{ISBN|0297765566}}, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], pp. 120\u2013129.</ref> After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor he wrote a famous letter to his [[Valentine Walton|brother-in-law]]. Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians, but failed to end Royalist resistance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/battle-of-marston-moor|publisher=British Civil Wars| title=The Battle of Marston Moor| accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe indecisive outcome of the [[Second Battle of Newbury]] in October meant that by the end of 1644 the war still showed no signs of ending. Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of \"low birth\" as officers in the army, to which he replied: \"If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them&nbsp;... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else\".<ref>Letter to Sir William Spring, September 1643, quoted in Carlyle, Thomas (ed.)

This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command. All of them\u2014except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament\u2014chose to renounce their military positions. The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms. In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Battle of Naseby 1645===\n[[File:Charles Landseer Cromwell Battle of Naseby.JPG|thumb|Cromwell in the Battle of Naseby in 1645. [[Charles Landseer]].]]\nAt the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender.<ref>Kenyon, John & Ohlmeyer, Jane (eds.) (2000). ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland, and Ireland 1638\u20131660'' (Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|0-19-280278-X}}, p.141</ref> Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at [[Bridgwater]], [[Sherborne]], Bristol, [[Devizes]], and [[Winchester]], then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June 1646.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Cromwell's military style===\nCromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.<ref>[[Austin Herbert Woolrych|Woolrych, Austin]] (1990). ''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp.117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nCromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-76556-6}}, pp. 154\u2013161</ref>\n\n==Politics: 1647\u20131649==\nIn February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/news/a-lasting-place-in-history-1-377880|title=A lasting place in history|publisher=Saffron Walden Reporter|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the \"[[Heads of Proposals]]\" pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Maurice|title=The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell|year=1957|publisher=Collier- Macmillan LTD.|location=London|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> It was designed to check the powers of the [[executive branch|executive]], to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] settlement.<ref>Although there is debate over whether Cromwell and Ireton were the authors of the Heads of Proposals or acting on behalf of Saye and Sele: Adamson, John (1987). \"The English Nobility and the Projected Settlement of 1647\", in ''Historical Journal'', 30, 3; Kishlansky, Mark (1990). \"Saye What?\" in ''Historical Journal'' 33, 4.</ref>\n\nMany in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other. The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1987).

If you move it down, it breaks the line into the next topic.--->\n\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the [[Second English Civil War]] in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms. Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]. The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning. The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks. Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|title=Spartacus: Rowland Laugharne at Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025014050/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|archivedate=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nCromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England. At [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Preston]], Cromwell, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, won a decisive victory against an army twice as large.<ref>Gardiner (1901), pp.144\u201347; Gaunt (1997) 94\u201397.</ref>\n\nDuring 1648, Cromwell's letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that \"they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land\". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod.<ref>Morrill and Baker (2008), p.31.</ref> These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument.<ref>Adamson, pp.76\u201384.</ref> The episode shows Cromwell's firm belief in \"[[Providentialism]]\"\u2014that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of \"chosen people\" (whom God had \"provided\" for such purposes). Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction.<ref>Jendrysik, p. 79</ref>\n\n===King tried and executed===\n{{main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|Execution of Charles I}}\nIn December 1648, in an episode that became known as [[Pride's Purge]], a troop of soldiers headed by Colonel [[Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from the [[Long Parliament]] all those who were not supporters of the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the New Model Army and the Independents.<ref>Macaulay, p. 68</ref> Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the [[Rump Parliament]], agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars.<ref name=bcw/> Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (\"The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\").<ref>Coward 1991, p. 65</ref>\n\nThe death warrant for Charles was eventually signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who was the third to sign it).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/collections/deathwarrant/|title=Death Warrant of King Charles I|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the King, or \"[[regicide]]\", was controversial, if for no other reason due to the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107021024/http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2015|title=Oliver Cromwell Destroys the \"Divine Right of Kings\"|first=Ben|last=Hart|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: \"None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who stooped to sign it.

The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller [[English Council of State|Council of State]] also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the \"Rump\" and was appointed a member of the Council. In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as \"[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]\". In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the \"[[New Model Army]]\". The \"[[Leveller]]\" or \"[[Agitator]]\" movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto \"[[Agreement of the People]]\" in 1647. Cromwell and the rest of the \"[[Grandees]]\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners. In the \"[[Putney Debates]]\" of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad. The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm |title=The Levellers |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish campaign: 1649\u201350==\n{{See also|Irish Confederate Wars|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649&ndash;50. Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\".<ref>Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000). ''Confederate Catholics at War'' ([[Cork University Press]]), {{ISBN|1-85918-244-5}}, p.115.</ref>\n\nCromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of [[Pope|papal]] and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in [[continental Europe]].<ref>Fraser, pp.74\u201376.</ref> Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (\"Gaels\")]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.326\u2013328.</ref>\n\nParliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England. At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture\u2014comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.98.</ref> Cromwell wrote afterwards that:\n\n<blockquote>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret<ref>{{cite book|last=Cromwell |first=Oliver|title=''\"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\"'' |editor=[[Thomas Carlyle]]|publisher=William H.

While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.<ref>Fraser, Antonia (1973). ''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'', and ''Cromwell: the Lord Protector'' (Phoenix Press), {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}} pp.344\u201346; and Austin Woolrych, ''Britain In Revolution'' (Oxford, 2002), p. 470</ref>\n\nAfter the taking of Drogheda, Cromwell sent a column north to [[Ulster]] to secure the north of the country and went on to [[Siege of Waterford|besiege Waterford]], [[Kilkenny]] and [[Clonmel]] in Ireland's south-east. Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.100.</ref>\n\nOne of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament.<ref>Fraser, pp.321\u2013322; Lenihan 2000, p.113.</ref> At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.<ref>Fraser, p.355.</ref>\n\nThe Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]] mostly consisted of long sieges of fortified cities and [[guerrilla warfare]] in the countryside. The last Catholic-held town, [[Galway]], surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April of the following year.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn the wake of the Commonwealth's conquest of the island of Ireland, the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.314.</ref> All Catholic-owned land was confiscated under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652]] and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament's financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur094.htm |title= Act for the Settlement of Ireland, 12 August 1652, Henry Scobell, ii. 197.

On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England.<ref>Lenihan 2000, p. 1O22; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare.

Sickness began to spread in the ranks. Cromwell was on the brink of evacuating his army by sea from [[Dunbar]]. However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]], killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.66.</ref> The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n===Battle of Worcester===\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made a desperate attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland.

He switched his reserves from one side of the river Severn to the other and then back again. The editor of the ''Great Rebellion'' article of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (eleventh edition) notes that Worcester was a battle of manoeuvre compared to the early Civil War [[Battle of Turnham Green]], which the English parliamentary armies were unable to execute at the start of the war, and he suggests that it was a prototype for the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]].<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition article \"GREAT REBELLION\" Sections \"4.

The rule of the Commonwealth and Protectorate was largely peaceful, apart from the Highlands. Moreover, there were no wholesale confiscations of land or property. Three out of every four Justices of the Peace in Commonwealth Scotland were Scots and the country was governed jointly by the English military authorities and a Scottish Council of State.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.320.</ref>\n\n==Return to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651\u20131653==\n{{Wikisource|Dissolution of the Long Parliament}}\nCromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves with the King gone as their \"common cause\". Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government.<ref>Worden, Blair (1977). ''The Rump Parliament'' (Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|0-521-29213-1}}, ch.16\u201317.</ref> Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers. Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said \"you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting\".<ref>Abbott, p.643</ref> At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the \"bauble\" be taken away.<ref>Abbott, p.642-643.</ref> His troops were commanded by [[Charles Worsley]], later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/charles-worsley|title=Charles Worsley|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Establishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653==\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]] for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of [[saint]]s. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs\u2014which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth\u2014he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Roots|1989|pp=8\u201327}} The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called [[Barebone's Parliament]] after one of its members, [[Praise-God Barebone]]. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1982).

It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake \"the chief magistracy and the administration of government\". Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia.<ref>Gaunt, p.155.</ref> However, from this point on Cromwell signed his name 'Oliver P', the ''P'' being an abbreviation for ''Protector'', which was similar to the style of monarchs who used an ''R'' to mean ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', and it soon became the norm for others to address him as \"Your Highness\".<ref>Gaunt, p.156.</ref> As Protector, he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of a Council of State. Nevertheless, Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army.

The first was \"healing and settling\" the nation after the chaos of the civil wars and the regicide, which meant establishing a stable form for the new government to take.<ref>Hirst, Derek (1990). \"The Lord Protector, 1653\u20138\", in Morrill, p.172.</ref> Although Cromwell declared to the first Protectorate Parliament that, \"Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental,\" in practice social priorities took precedence over forms of government. Such forms were, he said, \"but&nbsp;... dross and dung in comparison of Christ\".<ref>Quoted in Hirst, p.127.</ref> The social priorities did not, despite the revolutionary nature of the government, include any meaningful attempt to reform the social order.

Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=David Hackett |authorlink1=David Hackett Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1991 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195069051 |pages=219\u2013220 |chapter=The South of England to Virginia: Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants, 1642\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654. He declared that \"healing and settling\" were the \"great end of your meeting\".<ref>Roots 1989, pp.41\u201356.</ref> However, the Parliament was quickly dominated by those pushing for more radical, properly republican reforms. After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament's bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of \u00a3200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value in which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.<ref>Aylmer, G.E., ''Rebellion or Revolution?

He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England.<ref>Hirst, p.173.</ref> During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of \"triers\" was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of \"ejectors\" was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a [[Penruddock uprising|Royalist uprising in March 1655]], led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the Commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]\u2014instated in September 1656\u2014voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.<ref>Durston, Christopher (1998).

It was this\u2014allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside Puritanism\u2014that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]] in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Hirst, p.137.</ref> There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on [[Matthew 23]]:37\u201339 and [[Romans 11]]. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:12\u201315 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again\".<ref>Roots 1989, p.128.</ref> The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655\u2014comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.<ref>Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\", in Beales, D. and Best, G.

The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice: Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.<ref>Masson, p. 354</ref>\n\n==Death and posthumous execution==\n{{See also|Oliver Cromwell's head}}\n[[File:WarwickCastle CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Oliver Cromwell's death mask at [[Warwick Castle]]]]\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and from \"stone\" ([[kidney stone disease]]). In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the [[Doge of Venice]] in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death.{{sfn|McMains|2015|p=75}} The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter [[Elizabeth Claypole]] in August.

For example, ''The Machiavilian Cromwell'' and ''The Juglers Discovered'' are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the [[Levellers]] after 1647, and both present him as a [[Machiavelli]]an figure.<ref>Morrill, John (1990). \"Cromwell and his contemporaries\", in Morrill, pp.263\u20134.</ref> John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in ''A Warning Piece Discharged'', comparing him to [[Moses]] rescuing the English by taking them safely through the [[Red Sea]] of the civil wars.<ref>Morrill, pp.271\u20132.</ref> Poet [[John Milton]] called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his ''Sonnet XVI''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/4350/poem1456.html |title=RPO - John Milton : Sonnet XVI: To the Lord General Cromwell |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral biographies were published soon after Cromwell's death. An example is ''The Perfect Politician'', which describes how Cromwell \"loved men more than books\" and provides a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience who is brought down by pride and ambition.<ref>Morrill, pp. 279\u201381.</ref> An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] in his ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. Clarendon famously declares that Cromwell \"will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man\".<ref name=g9>Gaunt, p.9.</ref> He argues that Cromwell's rise to power had been helped by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness. Clarendon was not one of Cromwell's confidantes, and his account was written after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]].<ref name=g9/>\n\nDuring the early 18th century, Cromwell's image began to be adopted and reshaped by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy.  [[John Toland]] rewrote [[Edmund Ludlow]]'s ''Memoirs'' in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny. Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a despot who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s.<ref>Worden, Blair (2001). ''Roundhead Reputations: The English Civil Wars and the Passions of Posterity'' (Penguin), {{ISBN|0-14-100694-3}}, pp. 53\u201359</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=I hope to render the English name as great and formidable as ever the Roman was.<ref>\"The Life and Eccentricities of the late Dr. Monsey, F.R.S, physician to the Royal Hospital at Chelsea\", printed by J.D.

[[Thomas Carlyle]] continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of his letters and speeches, and describing English Puritanism as \"the last of all our Heroisms\" while taking a negative view of his own era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=Thomas |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |date=December 1843 |url=http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf}}</ref> By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness. Oxford civil war historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that \"the man\u2014it is ever so with the noblest\u2014was greater than his work\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.315.</ref> Gardiner stressed Cromwell's dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell's religious conviction.<ref>Worden, pp.256\u2013260.</ref> Cromwell's foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his \"constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.318.</ref> [[Calvin Coolidge]] described Cromwell as a brilliant statesman who \"dared to oppose the tyranny of the kings.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last= Coolidge\n |first= Calvin \n |date= 1929\n |title= The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge\n |location= USA\n |publisher=\n |page= 29\n |isbn= 978-1410216229\n |author-link=\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Cromwell's reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[Italian fascism|Italy]]. Harvard historian [[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morrill |first1=John |year=1990 |title=Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell |url= |journal=Historical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=629\u2013639 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X0001356X}}</ref>\n\nLate 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime. [[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.<ref>Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in ''History'' 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, {{ISSN|0018-2648}}.</ref> Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell's writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.<ref>Morrill (2004). \"Cromwell, Oliver (1599\u20131658)\", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (Oxford University Press) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765 Oxforddnb.com]; Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\".

[[Winston Churchill]] was First Lord of the Admiralty before [[World War I]], and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS ''Oliver Cromwell''. The suggestion was vetoed by [[George V of Great Britain|King George V]] because of his personal feelings and because he felt that it was unwise to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish political unrest]], especially given the anger caused by the statue outside Parliament. Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Admiral Battenberg]] that the King's decision must be treated as final.<ref>[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'', New York: [[Alfred A.

At 5 demerit intervals, a student will receive a detention, referred to as a \"Jug\" (standing for Justice Under God)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/kelly-creighton-prep-losing-a-living-saint/article_6b1b8769-4bc6-5f62-bbb2-7ff4188696c0.html|title=Kelly: Creighton Prep losing a 'living saint'|last=columnist|first=Michael Kelly / World-Herald|website=Omaha.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>.

Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.  On average, students receive approximately 5 demerits, or one Jug, per semester.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.creightonprep.creighton.edu/page.cfm?p=5130|title=Creighton Prep: FAQs for Parents|website=creightonprep.creighton.edu|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> In the event of a student missing a morning Jug or not completing their homework prior to the class, the student is the assigned to attend \"Laughlin Hour\" (formally referred to as \"Ninth Hour\").

Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.

Ellsworth traveled by horseback to the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Ohio]] to investigate family lands in the region. Ellsworth's father Oliver Ellsworth had purchased over {{convert|41000|acre|km2}} in the Western Reserve, including most of present-day [[Cleveland]], joining with other prominent Connecticut men snapping up over three million acres (12,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) sold by the state of Connecticut.<ref>The New Connecticut (Ohio) towns of Ellsworth and Windsor were named after the family and its Connecticut home.</ref> (Among the eight original purchasers was a family relation, merchant [[Thaddeus Leavitt]] of Suffield.) Ellsworth wrote a small, uneven book about his experiences entitled ''A Tour to New Connecticut in 1811''. Ellsworth's mission was straightening out irregularities in land sales by the family agent.\n\nIt was an arduous trip. Along the way Ellsworth made note of attractive vistas, rowdy drunks, solicitous innkeepers and his disappointment in places of which he had heard, like Erie. The journey's rigors were relieved by a meeting with his old friend Margaret Dwight, daughter of Yale president [[Timothy Dwight IV]], who was visiting family in present-day [[Warren, Ohio]]. \"Here too\", wrote Ellsworth, \"I met with my good old friend Margaret Dwight, we sat down and passed a few hours in social chat.\" Dwight wrote her own account of her Western Reserve trip, ''A Journey to Ohio in 1810''.<ref>Margaret Dwight's manuscript was edited by Max Farrand and published in 1912 as Volume I of the Yale Historical Manuscripts series.</ref>\n\nOver twenty years later, in 1832, Ellsworth traveled west again, this time as U.S. Commissioner of Indian Tribes in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]].<ref>Ellsworth wrote a book about this journey entitled ''Washington Irving on the Prairie: Or, A Narrative of a Tour of the Southwest in the Year 1832''.</ref> President [[Andrew Jackson]] appointed Ellsworth one of three commissioners to \"study the country, to mark the boundaries, to pacify the warring Indians and, in general to establish order and justice\" after Congress's passage of the 1830 [[Indian Removal Act]]. Ellsworth travelled to [[Fort Gibson]] to investigate the situation. (Some critics blame Ellsworth for being complicit in the subsequent removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to [[Indian Territory]], present-day Oklahoma, particularly since Ellsworth's appointment and subsequent western trip followed the Indian Removal Act, Andrew Jackson's first significant act as President. Other historians note Ellsworth's sympathetic outlook towards the tribes.)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tqzVNiFasC&pg=PA218&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+smith&lr=&ei=kib0SO64I4HEMpiywOsI&sig=ACfU3U0yM9Q5YlhTC0ngmGzJEpeMZtMhsg Fugitive Poses: Native American Indian Scenes of Absence and Presence, Gerald Robert Vizenor, University of Nebraska Press, 1998]</ref>\n[[Image:OliverEllsworthWindsorCT.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Oliver Ellsworth Homestead]], Windsor, Connecticut, birthplace of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, National Historic Landmark]]\nAlong the way, Ellsworth made stops in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], then traveled on to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he met with explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] and saw the recently captured Native American leader [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], chief of the [[Sauk and Fox]] tribe. Leavitt's mission was a complicated one: he was charged with trying to mediate between the conflicting claims of several Indian tribes, who were being forced into an ever-smaller area, in competition with newer immigrants and the interests of the [[Chouteau]] family, the powerful St. Louis magnates of the Midwestern fur trade.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyyuR36PNr4C&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+trail+of+tears&source=web&ots=v6drOD-jS2&sig=a8uQvAc2G3cS5yVmAE1h-CIWJkI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Aristocratic Encounters: European Travelers and North American Indians, Harry Liebersohn, Cambridge University Press, 1998]</ref>\n\nEllsworth was accompanied on the expedition by three companions: author [[Washington Irving]], who recorded his impressions in ''A Tour on the Prairies''; [[Charles La Trobe]], an [[Englishman]], [[mountaineer]] and [[travel writer]]  who later served in the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|British diplomatic corps]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Australia]]; and [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Count]] Albert Pourtales.<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v040/v040p355.pdf The Journal of the Union Mission, Hope Holway, [[University of Oklahoma]]]</ref>\n\nWashington Irving wrote of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, \"this worthy leader of our little band\": \"He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate simplicity and benevolence of heart. The greater part of his days had been passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and statesmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle and mingle among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=a04VAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22a+tour+on+the+prairies%22+washington+irving&ei=vObwSNHyCJqktAOL99Fy#PPA2,M1 A Tour on the Prairies, Washington Irving, Henry G. Bohn, London, 1850]</ref>\n\n==Patent Office==\nIn 1835, Ellsworth was elected mayor of Hartford, Connecticut, but had served only a month when he was appointed the first Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office, an office he held for ten years, from 1835 until 1845. His twin brother [[William W. Ellsworth]] was [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1838 to 1842, and served as a U.S. Congressman from Connecticut as well. William Wolcott Ellsworth was married to the daughter of [[Noah Webster]], the publisher of the eponymous dictionaries.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Patent Office, Ellsworth found one third of the floor-space in his office occupied by over 60 models of inventions; he moved them to a separate room. He also found that no list of patent applicants had ever been drawn up, a deficiency he soon corrected.\n[[File:500 Farmers Wanted.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Broadside (printing)|Broadside]] advertising sale by Ellsworth of parcels of his western lands, [[Lafayette, Indiana]], 1847]]\nActing as Patent Commissioner, Ellsworth made a decision that profoundly affected the future of Hartford and Connecticut. The young Samuel Colt was struggling to establish a firm to manufacture his new revolver. Ellsworth became interested in Colt's invention, and in 1836 made the decision to issue Colt U.S. Patent No. 138. On the basis of Ellsworth's decision, Colt was able to raise some $200,000 from investors to incorporate the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the forerunner of the mighty [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt arms]] manufacturing empire.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_4.shtml Gunmaker to the World, Ellsavorth S.

He became so interested, for instance, in a new-fangled invention by [[Samuel Morse]] called the telegraph that Ellsworth petitioned Congress for a $30,000 grant to test the possibilities of the technology.<ref>[http://patentmodelassociation.com/story.html The Story of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patentmodelassociation.com]</ref>\n\nFrom Ellsworth's exposure to the [[Western United States|West]] and knowledge of inventions, he prophesied late in life that the lands of the West would be cultivated by means of steam plows. This prophecy was introduced in the probate of his will in an attempt to prove that he was of unsound mind.\n\nEllsworth was proven correct, of course, and his interest in agriculture during his time as Patent Commissioner induced Congress in 1839 to appropriate the first monies for farming, which were used to collect seeds from foreign countries and distribute them through the United States post office, as Ellsworth had urged.

Ellsworth traveled by horseback to the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Ohio]] to investigate family lands in the region. Ellsworth's father Oliver Ellsworth had purchased over {{convert|41000|acre|km2}} in the Western Reserve, including most of present-day [[Cleveland]], joining with other prominent Connecticut men snapping up over three million acres (12,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) sold by the state of Connecticut.<ref>The New Connecticut (Ohio) towns of Ellsworth and Windsor were named after the family and its Connecticut home.</ref> (Among the eight original purchasers was a family relation, merchant [[Thaddeus Leavitt]] of Suffield.) Ellsworth wrote a small, uneven book about his experiences entitled ''A Tour to New Connecticut in 1811''. Ellsworth's mission was straightening out irregularities in land sales by the family agent.\n\nIt was an arduous trip. Along the way Ellsworth made note of attractive vistas, rowdy drunks, solicitous innkeepers and his disappointment in places of which he had heard, like Erie. The journey's rigors were relieved by a meeting with his old friend Margaret Dwight, daughter of Yale president [[Timothy Dwight IV]], who was visiting family in present-day [[Warren, Ohio]]. \"Here too\", wrote Ellsworth, \"I met with my good old friend Margaret Dwight, we sat down and passed a few hours in social chat.\" Dwight wrote her own account of her Western Reserve trip, ''A Journey to Ohio in 1810''.<ref>Margaret Dwight's manuscript was edited by Max Farrand and published in 1912 as Volume I of the Yale Historical Manuscripts series.</ref>\n\nOver twenty years later, in 1832, Ellsworth traveled west again, this time as U.S. Commissioner of Indian Tribes in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]].<ref>Ellsworth wrote a book about this journey entitled ''Washington Irving on the Prairie: Or, A Narrative of a Tour of the Southwest in the Year 1832''.</ref> President [[Andrew Jackson]] appointed Ellsworth one of three commissioners to \"study the country, to mark the boundaries, to pacify the warring Indians and, in general to establish order and justice\" after Congress's passage of the 1830 [[Indian Removal Act]]. Ellsworth travelled to [[Fort Gibson]] to investigate the situation. (Some critics blame Ellsworth for being complicit in the subsequent removal of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to [[Indian Territory]], present-day Oklahoma, particularly since Ellsworth's appointment and subsequent western trip followed the Indian Removal Act, Andrew Jackson's first significant act as President. Other historians note Ellsworth's sympathetic outlook towards the tribes.)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tqzVNiFasC&pg=PA218&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+smith&lr=&ei=kib0SO64I4HEMpiywOsI&sig=ACfU3U0yM9Q5YlhTC0ngmGzJEpeMZtMhsg Fugitive Poses: Native American Indian Scenes of Absence and Presence, Gerald Robert Vizenor, University of Nebraska Press, 1998]</ref>\n[[Image:OliverEllsworthWindsorCT.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Oliver Ellsworth Homestead]], Windsor, Connecticut, birthplace of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, National Historic Landmark]]\nAlong the way, Ellsworth made stops in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], then traveled on to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he met with explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] and saw the recently captured Native American leader [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], chief of the [[Sauk and Fox]] tribe. Leavitt's mission was a complicated one: he was charged with trying to mediate between the conflicting claims of several Indian tribes, who were being forced into an ever-smaller area, in competition with newer immigrants and the interests of the [[Chouteau]] family, the powerful St. Louis magnates of the Midwestern fur trade.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyyuR36PNr4C&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=%22henry+leavitt+ellsworth%22+trail+of+tears&source=web&ots=v6drOD-jS2&sig=a8uQvAc2G3cS5yVmAE1h-CIWJkI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Aristocratic Encounters: European Travelers and North American Indians, Harry Liebersohn, Cambridge University Press, 1998]</ref>\n\nEllsworth was accompanied on the expedition by three companions: author [[Washington Irving]], who recorded his impressions in ''A Tour on the Prairies''; [[Charles La Trobe]], an [[Englishman]], [[mountaineer]] and [[travel writer]]  who later served in the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|British diplomatic corps]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Australia]]; and [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Count]] Albert Pourtales.<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v040/v040p355.pdf The Journal of the Union Mission, Hope Holway, [[University of Oklahoma]]]</ref>\n\nWashington Irving wrote of Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, \"this worthy leader of our little band\": \"He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate simplicity and benevolence of heart. The greater part of his days had been passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and statesmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle and mingle among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=a04VAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22a+tour+on+the+prairies%22+washington+irving&ei=vObwSNHyCJqktAOL99Fy#PPA2,M1 A Tour on the Prairies, Washington Irving, Henry G.

His twin brother [[William W. Ellsworth]] was [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1838 to 1842, and served as a U.S. Congressman from Connecticut as well. William Wolcott Ellsworth was married to the daughter of [[Noah Webster]], the publisher of the eponymous dictionaries.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Patent Office, Ellsworth found one third of the floor-space in his office occupied by over 60 models of inventions; he moved them to a separate room. He also found that no list of patent applicants had ever been drawn up, a deficiency he soon corrected.\n[[File:500 Farmers Wanted.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Broadside (printing)|Broadside]] advertising sale by Ellsworth of parcels of his western lands, [[Lafayette, Indiana]], 1847]]\nActing as Patent Commissioner, Ellsworth made a decision that profoundly affected the future of Hartford and Connecticut. The young Samuel Colt was struggling to establish a firm to manufacture his new revolver. Ellsworth became interested in Colt's invention, and in 1836 made the decision to issue Colt U.S. Patent No. 138. On the basis of Ellsworth's decision, Colt was able to raise some $200,000 from investors to incorporate the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the forerunner of the mighty [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt arms]] manufacturing empire.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_4.shtml Gunmaker to the World, Ellsavorth S.

He became so interested, for instance, in a new-fangled invention by [[Samuel Morse]] called the telegraph that Ellsworth petitioned Congress for a $30,000 grant to test the possibilities of the technology.<ref>[http://patentmodelassociation.com/story.html The Story of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, patentmodelassociation.com]</ref>\n\nFrom Ellsworth's exposure to the [[Western United States|West]] and knowledge of inventions, he prophesied late in life that the lands of the West would be cultivated by means of steam plows. This prophecy was introduced in the probate of his will in an attempt to prove that he was of unsound mind.\n\nEllsworth was proven correct, of course, and his interest in agriculture during his time as Patent Commissioner induced Congress in 1839 to appropriate the first monies for farming, which were used to collect seeds from foreign countries and distribute them through the United States post office, as Ellsworth had urged. By 1845 Ellsworth's patent office was performing the functions of a full-fledged agricultural bureau. For this accomplishment Ellsworth earned the sobriquet \"Father of the United States Department of Agriculture.\"\n\nA comment by Ellsworth about the increased workload at the patent office, taken out of context and embellished, was apparently the source of an [[urban legend]] that a patent office official ([[Charles H.
