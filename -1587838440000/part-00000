He was [[Roman consul|consul ordinarius]] in 152 with [[Marcus Valerius Homullus]] as his colleague. Acilius Glabrio is known almost solely from surviving inscriptions.\n\n== Ancestry and Birth ==\nAssuming that he was appointed consul ordinarius ''anno suo'', Acilius Glabrio was born in 119.<ref>Syme, \"An Eccentric Patrician\", ''Chiron'', '''10''' (1980), pp. 432, 433</ref> He belonged to the [[Acilia (gens)#Acilii Glabriones|Acilii Glabriones]], a family that first gained prominence during [[Roman Republic|Republican]] times. Although it had been a [[Plebeian]] family during the Republic, by Acilius Glabrio's lifetime it had been granted [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] status.\n\nHis father was [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 124)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]], consul in 124; and his grandfather was [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 91)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]], consul in 91.<ref>Paul Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435641 \"Who Was Acilius?\"], ''[[Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte]]'', '''27''' (1978), pp. 621ff</ref>\n\nAcilius Glabrio's name presents a problem, due to its [[Roman naming conventions#Binary nomenclature and polyonymy|polyonymous]] nature. In short, he has multiple names\u2014\"Manius Acilius Glabrio\" and \"Gnaeus Cornelius Severus\"\u2014which is baffling to anyone more familiar with the ''[[tria nomina]]'' of the Late Republic and Early Empire.

He was said to have been born about 1735-6 (from his age at burial) but was probably born (from his age at marriage) in 1747-8 and was said to have married in 1767 (whereas he married in 1783). He was actually the son of Jean Charles Marsac (1708-1751), a servant to one of George II's pages, Joachim Lorentz Sollifoffer (died 1754), who in his will made generous provision for the widowed Margaret Marsac nee Saunders and her child Jean Charles who was his godson. Jean Charles Marsac's father was the son of a migrant from [[Poitou]], also called Charles Marsac, a carpenter, who had come to England before 1704/5. Jean Charles Marsac was usually called Charles Marsac and was apprenticed as a weaver. He died in [[Kensington]] in 1751 and had married at [[St Martin in the Fields]] in 1745/6 one Margaret Saunders who was probably related to Thomas Saunders (died 1753), standing wardrobe keeper to George I and George II.
