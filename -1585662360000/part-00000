Directed by [[Steve Bendelack]] and written for the screen by [[Hamish McColl]] and [[Robin Driscoll]] (a writer on the TV series), from a story by [[Simon McBurney]], it is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] venture produced by [[StudioCanal]], [[Working Title Films]] and [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Films]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars [[Rowan Atkinson]] in the [[Mr. Bean (character)|title role]], with [[Maxim Baldry|Max Baldry]], [[Emma de Caunes]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Karel Roden]] in supporting roles.\n\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007 and in the United States on 24 August 2007, both to mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, having grossed $229.7 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007)|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean2.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2019-04-01}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nDuring a rainy day in [[London]], [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] arrives in a [[church]] [[f\u00eate]], where he wins in a [[raffle]] a holiday by train to [[Cannes]], a [[video camera]] <!--the brand is irrelevant -->and [[Euro|\u20ac]]200.<!--IT'S A SUMMARY, NOT A COMPETITION TO SEE WHO CAN REMEMBER THE MOST DETAIL --> Upon arriving at the [[Gare de Lyon]], Bean causes chaos while sampling [[seafood]] cuisine at [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|Le Train Bleu]].\n\nOn the platform, Bean asks Russian filmmaker Emil Duchevsky to film him boarding the train using his new video camera, but Bean keeps asking for retakes until the train leaves with Bean and Duchevsky's son, Stepan, on board while Duchevsky is left behind.\n\nAfter Bean and Stepan get off at the next station, Duchevsky's train does not stop at the station and instead he holds up a mobile phone number but accidentally covers up the last two digits; attempts at calling the number prove to be fruitless. The duo then board the next train, but due to Bean having left his wallet, passport and ticket in the [[telephone booth]], they are thrown off the train.\n\nBean [[Street performance|busks]] as a mime and buys himself and Stepan bus tickets to Cannes. However, after Bean separates himself from Stepan after losing his ticket and chasing it, he sets out walking and hitchhiking on his own. The next morning, he wakes up in what appears to be a quaint French village under attack from German soldiers, but it is revealed to be a film set for a yoghurt commercial directed by American filmmaker Carson Clay; Bean becomes an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in the advert until he accidentally destroys the set in an explosion while recharging his camera.\n\nContinuing to hitchhike, Bean is picked up by a [[Mini]] identical to his own driven by actress Sabine, who is on her way to the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|59th Cannes Film Festival]] where the film in which she makes her debut is to be presented. At a service station, they find Stepan dancing with a band and take him with them. When Sabine falls asleep, Bean ends up driving the Mini through the night.\n\nThe next morning, Sabine, Bean and Stepan finally reach Cannes, but leave when Sabine sees that her film premiere begins in merely one hour. Upon stopping at a petrol station, Sabine sees on television that Bean is suspected of kidnapping Stepan while Sabine is Bean's accomplice, but doesn't want to go to the police as she doesn't want to be late for her premiere; Bean promptly disguises himself and Stepan as Sabine's mother and daughter in order to gain entry to Sabine's premiere.\n\nAt the festival, Bean and Sabine are shocked to see that Sabine's role has been cut from the film. After Bean plugs his video camera into the projector, which projects his video diary, the bizarre tale it tells fits director Carson Clay's narration well, to which he, Sabine and Bean all receive standing ovations while Stepan is finally reunited with his parents.\n\nAfter the screening, Bean leaves the building and finally arrives at the Cannes [[beach]], where he and the other characters of the film mime a large French musical finale. In a [[post-credits scene]], Bean writes \"FIN\" in the sand with his foot and films it until the camera's battery dies.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:RowanAtkinsonMar07.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rowan Atkinson]] at a premiere for the film in March 2007.]]\n*[[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]]\n*[[Emma de Caunes]] as Sabine\n*[[Maxim Baldry]] as Stepan Dachevsky\n*[[Willem Dafoe]] as Carson Clay\n*[[Jean Rochefort]] as the Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel\n*[[Karel Roden]] as Emil Dachevsky\n*[[Catherine Hosmalin]] as Ticket Inspector\n*[[Urbain Cancelier]] as Bus Driver\n*[[St\u00e9phane Debac]] as Traffic Controller\n*[[Julie Ferrier]] as The First AD\n*[[Steve Pemberton]] as The Vicar\n*Lily Atkinson as Lily\n\n==Production==\n{{citations needed|date=January 2020}}\nIn February 2001, before filming began on ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', [[Rowan Atkinson]] was lured into making a second film about ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' going on an [[Australia|Australian]] adventure under the [[working title]] ''Down Under Bean''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.com/news/item/2868/bean-down-under-for-rowan-atkinson.phtml|title=Bean Down Under For Rowan Atkinson|publisher=cinema.com|date=7 February 2001|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> However, this idea was scrapped in favour of ''Mr. Bean's Holiday'', which was particularly inspired by the film ''[[Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot|Monsieur Hulot's Holiday]]'' (1953), whose [[Monsieur Hulot|title character]] inspired the character of Mr. Bean. [[Principal photography]] for the film began on 15 May 2006 under the working title ''French Bean''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn March 2005, news of the film suggested that it would be scripted by [[Simon McBurney]], but in December 2005, Atkinson said that the script was actually being written by himself and his longtime collaborator and ''Mr. Bean'' co-creator [[Richard Curtis]]. The screenplay was later confirmed to have been instead written by [[Robin Driscoll]] (also a writer on the TV series) and [[Hamish McColl]] while the story was instead penned by McBurney, who also served as one of the [[executive producer]]s on the film alongside Curtis.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[Howard Goodall]], who also composed the original ''Mr. Bean'' series, although the original ''Mr. Bean'' theme was unused. It has a symphonic [[Orchestra|orchestration]], which is a sophisticated score instead of the series' tendency to simple musical repetitions and also features catchy [[leitmotif]]s for particular characters or scenes. The film's theme song was \"[[Crash (The Primitives song)#Matt Willis version|Crash]]\" by [[Matt Willis]].\n\n==Release==\nIt was the official film for [[Red Nose Day 2007]], with money from the film going towards the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Prior to the film's release, a new and exclusive Mr. Bean sketch titled  ''Mr. Bean's Wedding'' was broadcast on the telethon for Comic Relief on [[BBC One]] on 16 March 2007.\n\nThe official [[premiere]] of the film took place at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on Sunday, 25 March and helped to raise money for both Comic Relief and the Oxford Children's Hospital.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Universal Pictures released a [[teaser trailer]] for the film in November 2006 and launched an official website online the following month.\n\n===Home media===\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' was released on both [[DVD]] and [[HD DVD]] on 27 November 2007. The DVD release is in separate [[widescreen]] and [[pan and scan]] formats in the United States. The DVD charted at No.&nbsp;1 on the DVD chart in the United Kingdom on its week of release. Following the [[High-definition optical disc format war|2006-08 high-definition optical disc format war]], the film was released on [[Blu-ray]] in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2010.

The first deleted scene shows Bean spilling coffee on a [[laptop]] in front of two sleeping men. He cleans it up by licking the screen and wiping the keyboard with napkins, leaving just as one man wakes and blames the other for destroying his laptop; this scene was featured on trailers and TV spots for the film, while the North American release has it in place of the vending machine scene. The second deleted scene shows Bean tricking a man to get a train ticket and staying with Stepan on the train.\n\nThe fourth shows Bean carrying Stepan all the way through a plaza. The fifth shows Sabine leaving emotionally and almost being run over by a truck, Bean doing silly moves along the road (which are later seen in Carson Clay's ''Playback Time'' in the final cut), playing with the shadows in the morning, miming his journey to Stepan at the cafeteria, being menaced by a projectionist at the Cannes Film Festival (during the playing of Clay's movie), accidentally cutting the film roll and trying to stick it back together and Carson Clay discovering the film roll accumulating in the projection room. The damaged film is seen lying next to the projector in the final cut, though it remains unexplained. Finally, Bean is seen dancing at the beach, a scene that was replaced by the characters singing \"[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]\".\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' opened in the United States on 24 August 2007, alongside ''[[War (2007 film)|War]]'' and ''[[The Nanny Diaries (film)|The Nanny Diaries]]'', and grossed $9,889,780 in its opening weekend while playing in 1,714 theaters, with a $5,770 per-theater average and ranking No. 4 at the box office.

At first glance, he seems to be moulded from the primordial clay of nightmares: a leering man-child with a body like a tangle of tweed-coated pipe cleaners and the [[gurn]]ing, window-licking countenance of a suburban sex offender.

Directed by [[Steve Bendelack]] and written for the screen by [[Hamish McColl]] and [[Robin Driscoll]] (a writer on the TV series), from a story by [[Simon McBurney]], it is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] venture produced by [[StudioCanal]], [[Working Title Films]] and [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Films]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars [[Rowan Atkinson]] in the [[Mr. Bean (character)|title role]], with [[Maxim Baldry|Max Baldry]], [[Emma de Caunes]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Karel Roden]] in supporting roles,.\n\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007 and in the United States on 24 August 2007, both to mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, having grossed $229.7 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007)|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean2.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2019-04-01}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn a raffle, Mr. Bean wins a holiday by train to [[Cannes]], a video camera, <!--the brand is irrelevant -->and [[Euro|\u20ac]]200.<!--IT'S A SUMMARY, NOT A COMPETITION TO SEE WHO CAN REMEMBER THE MOST DETAIL --> Before catching his train, Bean causes chaos while sampling French seafood cuisine in a Paris restaurant.\n\nOn the platform at [[Gare de Lyon]], Bean asks movie director Emil Duchevsky ([[Karel Roden]]) to film him boarding the train using his new video camera. Bean keeps asking for retakes, until the train leaves with Bean and Duchevsky's son, Stepan ([[Max Baldry]]) on the train and Duchevsky is left behind.\n\nBean and the boy get off at the next station. Duchevsky's train does not stop at the station, and he holds up a mobile phone number, but accidentally covers up the last two digits. Attempts at calling the number are fruitless. They board the next train but Bean has left his wallet, passport, and ticket in the [[telephone booth]], and they are thrown off the train.\n\nBean [[Street performance|busks]] as a mime and buys the pair bus tickets to Cannes. Bean manages to lose both his ticket and Stepan so he sets out walking and hitchhiking.\n\nThe next morning, he wakes in what appears to be a quaint French village under attack from German soldiers. It transpires to be a film set for a yoghurt advertisement directed by Carson Clay ([[Willem Dafoe]]), and Bean becomes an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] in the advert until he accidentally destroys the set in an explosion while recharging his camera.\n\nContinuing to hitchhike, Bean is picked up by actress Sabine ([[Emma de Caunes]]), on her way to [[Cannes Film Festival]] where the film in which she makes her debut is to be presented. At a service station they find Stepan dancing with a band and take him with them. The trio end up driving through the night.\n\nSabine sees on TV that Bean is suspected of kidnapping Stepan. She doesn't go to the police as she does not want to be late for her film premiere, which is in just one hour. To avoid detection, Bean disguises himself and Stepan as Sabine's mother and daughter to gain entry to Sabine's premiere.\n\nAt the festival, Bean and Sabine are shocked to see that Sabine's role has been cut from the film. He plugs his video camera into the projector, projecting his video diary. The bizarre tale it tells fits director Carson Clay's narration well, and the director, Sabine and Bean all receive standing ovations. Stepan is finally reunited with his father.\n\nAfter the screening, Bean leaves the building and goes to the beach, where he and the other characters of the film mime a large French musical finale. [[Post-credits scene|After the credits]], Bean writes \"FIN\" in the sand with his foot. The camera's battery dies, ending the film.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:RowanAtkinsonMar07.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rowan Atkinson]] at a premiere for the film in March 2007.]]\n*[[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]]\n*[[Emma de Caunes]] as Sabine\n*[[Maxim Baldry]] as Stepan Dachevsky\n*[[Willem Dafoe]] as Carson Clay\n*[[Jean Rochefort]] as the Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel\n*[[Karel Roden]] as Emil Dachevsky\n*[[Catherine Hosmalin]] as Ticket Inspector\n*[[Urbain Cancelier]] as Bus Driver\n*[[St\u00e9phane Debac]] as Traffic Controller\n*[[Julie Ferrier]] as The First AD\n*[[Steve Pemberton]] as The Vicar\n*Lily Atkinson as Lily\n\n==Production==\n{{citations needed|date=January 2020}}\nIn February 2001, before filming began on ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', [[Rowan Atkinson]] was lured into making a second film about ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' going on an [[Australia|Australian]] adventure under the [[working title]] ''Down Under Bean''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.com/news/item/2868/bean-down-under-for-rowan-atkinson.phtml|title=Bean Down Under For Rowan Atkinson|publisher=cinema.com|date=7 February 2001|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> However, this idea was scrapped in favour of ''Mr. Bean's Holiday'', which was particularly inspired by the film ''[[Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot|Monsieur Hulot's Holiday]]'' (1953), whose [[Monsieur Hulot|title character]] inspired the character of Mr. Bean. [[Principal photography]] for the film began on 15 May 2006 under the working title ''French Bean''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn March 2005, news of the film suggested that it would be scripted by [[Simon McBurney]], but in December 2005, Atkinson said that the script was actually being written by himself and his longtime collaborator and ''Mr. Bean'' co-creator [[Richard Curtis]]. The screenplay was later confirmed to have been instead written by [[Robin Driscoll]] (also a writer on the TV series) and [[Hamish McColl]] while the story was instead penned by McBurney, who also served as one of the [[executive producer]]s on the film alongside Curtis.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[Howard Goodall]], who also composed the original ''Mr. Bean'' series, although the original ''Mr. Bean'' theme was unused. It has a symphonic [[Orchestra|orchestration]], which is a sophisticated score instead of the series' tendency to simple musical repetitions and also features catchy [[leitmotif]]s for particular characters or scenes. The film's theme song was \"[[Crash (The Primitives song)#Matt Willis version|Crash]]\" by [[Matt Willis]].\n\n==Release==\nIt was the official film for [[Red Nose Day 2007]], with money from the film going towards the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Prior to the film's release, a new and exclusive Mr. Bean sketch titled  ''Mr. Bean's Wedding'' was broadcast on the telethon for Comic Relief on [[BBC One]] on 16 March 2007.\n\nThe official [[premiere]] of the film took place at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on Sunday, 25 March and helped to raise money for both Comic Relief and the Oxford Children's Hospital.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Universal Pictures released a [[teaser trailer]] for the film in November 2006 and launched an official website online the following month.\n\n===Home media===\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' was released on both [[DVD]] and [[HD DVD]] on 27 November 2007. The DVD release is in separate [[widescreen]] and [[pan and scan]] formats in the United States. The DVD charted at No.&nbsp;1 on the DVD chart in the United Kingdom on its week of release.

The first deleted scene shows Bean spilling coffee on a [[laptop]] in front of two sleeping men. He cleans it up by licking the screen and wiping the keyboard with napkins, leaving just as one man wakes and blames the other for destroying his laptop; this scene was featured on trailers and TV spots for the film, while the North American release has it in place of the vending machine scene. The second deleted scene shows Bean tricking a man to get a train ticket and staying with Stepan on the train.\n\nThe fourth shows Bean carrying Stepan all the way through a plaza. The fifth shows Sabine leaving emotionally and almost being run over by a truck, Bean doing silly moves along the road (which are later seen in Carson Clay's ''Playback Time'' in the final cut), playing with the shadows in the morning, miming his journey to Stepan at the cafeteria, being menaced by a projectionist at the Cannes Film Festival (during the playing of Clay's movie), accidentally cutting the film roll and trying to stick it back together and Carson Clay discovering the film roll accumulating in the projection room. The damaged film is seen lying next to the projector in the final cut, though it remains unexplained. Finally, Bean is seen dancing at the beach, a scene that was replaced by the characters singing \"[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]\".\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' opened in the United States on 24 August 2007, alongside ''[[War (2007 film)|War]]'' and ''[[The Nanny Diaries (film)|The Nanny Diaries]]'', and grossed $9,889,780 in its opening weekend while playing in 1,714 theaters, with a $5,770 per-theater average and ranking No. 4 at the box office.

To pay for his grandmother's care, he agrees to deliver a case of [[marijuana]] for his best friend Trevor, a drug dealer. Mike astutely avoids being arrested in a sting, only to stumble into a job interview with Harvey Specter, called the best closer in the city. Mike's knowledge of the law impresses Harvey enough to win him the associate position, even though Mike didn't attend Harvard. Together they try cases for the firm while maintaining the secret that Mike is a fraud.\n\n===Season 2 (2012\u201313)===\n{{main|Suits (season 2)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nJessica Pearson, the managing partner, learns Mike's secret, but other issues take precedence when co-founding partner Daniel Hardman returns to the firm, pressuring Jessica and Harvey. Mike begins to foster a relationship with paralegal Rachel Zane, but finds himself pursuing other romantic entanglements after his grandmother's sudden death. Harvey and his secretary Donna face accusations of burying evidence and must discover the truth while keeping incriminating evidence from Hardman, who would use it to leverage a managing partner position. The intensifying threat from Hardman forces Jessica into a merger with a British firm headed by Edward Darby. Mike tells Rachel he's a fraud.\n\n===Season 3 (2013\u201314)===\n{{main|Suits (season 3)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nDarby's presence in the firm gives Harvey leverage to seek a position as a named partner. Meanwhile, the merger causes Louis Litt to clash with his British counterpart. Darby International client Ava Hessington draws Harvey into a lengthy trial against his former mentor, and the lawsuit turns into a murder charge. Realizing that his fraud can't continue forever, Mike leaves newly renamed Pearson Specter to take a position as an investment banker.\n\n===Season 4 (2014\u201315)===\n{{main|Suits (season 4)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nMike's new job puts him and Harvey on opposite sides of a takeover battle, causing the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] to accuse them of collusion. When Mike is fired, Louis goes to extreme lengths to persuade Mike to come back to Pearson Specter, rather than working for shady billionaire investor Charles Forstman. Louis demands a name partner position, competing with Harvey, but his wrongdoings get him fired instead. When he realizes Mike never went to Harvard, he blackmails Jessica into rehiring him with the promotion he desired. Mike proposes to Rachel; Donna leaves Harvey to work for Louis.\n\n===Season 5 (2015\u201316)===\n{{main|Suits (season 5)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nHarvey struggles with losing Donna and begins to open up to a therapist about his broken relationship with his mother. Louis' insecurity, however, and desire to undermine Harvey create an opening for Jack Soloff, an ambitious partner who is being manipulated by Hardman. Rachel's wedding plans and her relationship with her parents are both overshadowed by Mike's secret. Mike and Harvey both resign to protect their future, but Mike is abruptly arrested for fraud. More and more people involved realize the allegations are true, and facing a tenacious prosecutor Anita Gibbs, Mike accepts a plea bargain, pleads guilty, and turns himself in so that no one else will go to jail. At the wedding, Mike tells Rachel that he will not marry her now but if she still wants him in two years then he will marry her after getting out of prison. Harvey escorts him to prison making their last few goodbyes.\n\n===Season 6 (2016\u201317)===\n{{main|Suits (season 6)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nA two-year prison sentence puts Mike at the mercy of Frank Gallo, an inmate with a grudge against Harvey. At Pearson Specter Litt, few employees remain to help. Rachel works an [[Innocence Project]] case for her law professor; Jessica assists pro bono but is distracted from matters at the firm, and chooses to leave her position to pursue her own life. Mike's cellmate proves pivotal in a deal for Mike's freedom. He struggles with his fraud being public knowledge but obtains a job at a legal clinic. Harvey helps both Rachel and Mike pass the Bar, and persuades Mike to come back to the firm.\n\n===Season 7 (2017\u201318)===\n{{main|Suits (season 7)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nEveryone at the firm struggles to adjust to a new normal without Jessica. Donna takes a position as COO, and Harvey's friend Alex joins the team. Harvey begins dating his former therapist, Paula; Louis sees a therapist of his own, with mixed results. Rachel begins her career as an attorney, having passed the Bar. Mike continues to work pro bono cases at the clinic, with Harvey's blessing, but one of the cases puts Alex, Harvey and others at risk. Louis and Sheila reconnect; as does [[Pearson (TV series)|Jessica with her family in Chicago]]. Mike and Rachel accept a job offer in [[Seattle]] to run their own firm that takes on class-action suits, and get married before leaving. As the season closes, a case that puts Specter Litt in danger is found to be the work of Robert Zane's partners, Rand and Kaldor. When Zane finds out, he joins forces with Specter Litt.\n\n===Season 8 (2018\u201319)===\n{{main|Suits (season 8)}}\nAs Mike and Rachel leave after getting married, Robert Zane is now the managing partner of Zane Specter Litt, with Donna remaining in her COO role. Robert hires a new senior partner, his right hand and fixer Samantha Wheeler. Wheeler later becomes a name partner alongside Alex Williams. Louis learns that Sheila is pregnant. Katrina Bennett makes senior partner, and struggles with romantic feelings for her married personal associate. Donna and Harvey finally admit their feelings for one another as Season 8 ends, but Donna's mishandling of client/boyfriend Thomas Kessler forces Zane to sacrifice his legal career for the good of the firm.\n\n=== Season 9 (2019) ===\n{{Main|Suits (season 9)}}\nWith Robert now disbarred, Faye Richardson, a special master from the bar is sent to oversee the firm due to the perception of the underhanded tactics they have been involved with for years.

Korsh and his agent took the script to several production companies and wanted to give the script to [[Universal Media Studios]].  However, Korsh found it odd that the studio did not want to sell the script to [[NBC]], the network the studio typically worked with.  Korsh's agent convinced USA Network executive Alex Sepiol that although the series was neither a [[Procedural (genre)|procedural]] nor what the network typically did, he would like the characters.  Sepiol approved of the script, and by then, Hypnotic Films & Television signed on to the project.  The team pitched the script to USA network, which bought the script after the pitch. Korsh did not pitch it to anyone else.  When rewriting the script, Korsh made only small changes to the first half-hour, up to when Mike is hired.  Originally, Mike did not take [[LSAT]]s for others and only pretends to have attended Harvard, as opposed to pretending he attended Harvard and has a law degree.  Korsh noted that there is no degree or test needed, to work on Wall Street and be a mathematical genius, unlike the [[bar examination]] in law.  He decided to \"embrace\" this difference and change the premise.<ref name=\"Korsh Interview THR\">{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title='Suits' Originally Set on Wall Street Before Getting Retooled for USA, Says Creator|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/suits-originally-set-wall-street-205066|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=August 9, 2012|date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe pilot episode was filmed in New York City, where the series is set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suits-star-gabriel-macht-prefers-257698 | title='Suits' Star Gabriel Macht Prefers Shooting Hit Legal Drama in NYC, Over Toronto | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012|author=Vlessing, Etan}}</ref>  The rest of the series is filmed in Toronto (at Downsview Park Studios), where the sets are built to be identical to the New York law offices seen in the pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poptimal.com/2011/06/suits-set-report-welcoming-a-new-show-with-open-arms/#.UCP08U2PWSp | title=Suits Set Report: Welcoming a New Show with Open Arms | publisher=[[Poptimal]] | date=June 25, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012 |author=Jaar, Stephanie}}</ref> To promote the series debut, USA had an advance screening of the pilot on June 2, 2011, at the [[Hudson River Park]] and distributed free [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]] Sundaes cones at the viewing.<ref name=\"Ice Cream Publicity TFC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/27/usa-network-kicks-off-sizzling-summer-with-entertainment-weekly-and-the-haagen-dazs-brand-506115/20110527usa02/|title=USA Network Kicks Off Sizzling Summer With Entertainment Weekly and the Haagen-Dazs(R) Brand | publisher=The Futon Critic |date=May 27, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://poptimal.com/2011/06/usa-networks-summer-of-originals-screenings-pier-perfection/#.UCPNlk2PWSo | title=USA Network's Summer of Originals Screenings: Pier Perfection | publisher=[[Poptimal]] | date=June 5, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012 | author=Sellitti, Renata}}</ref>  The network also had a branded ice cream carts, bikes, and scooters give away at the Sundaes and USA/''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 2011 promotion summer guides on June 22 and 23.

To pay for his grandmother's care, he agrees to deliver a case of [[marijuana]] for his best friend Trevor, a drug dealer. Mike astutely avoids being arrested in a sting, only to stumble into a job interview with Harvey Specter, called the best closer in the city. Mike's knowledge of the law impresses Harvey enough to win him the associate position, even though Mike didn't attend Harvard. Together they try cases for the firm while maintaining the secret that Mike is a fraud.\n\n===Season 2 (2012\u201313)===\n{{main|Suits (season 2)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nJessica Pearson, the managing partner, learns Mike's secret, but other issues take precedence when co-founding partner Daniel Hardman returns to the firm, pressuring Jessica and Harvey. Mike begins to foster a relationship with paralegal Rachel Zane, but finds himself pursuing other romantic entanglements after his grandmother's sudden death. Harvey and his secretary Donna face accusations of burying evidence and must discover the truth while keeping incriminating evidence from Hardman, who would use it to leverage a managing partner position. The intensifying threat from Hardman forces Jessica into a merger with a British firm headed by Edward Darby. Mike tells Rachel he's a fraud.\n\n===Season 3 (2013\u201314)===\n{{main|Suits (season 3)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nDarby's presence in the firm gives Harvey leverage to seek a position as a named partner. Meanwhile, the merger causes Louis Litt to clash with his British counterpart. Darby International client Ava Hessington draws Harvey into a lengthy trial against his former mentor, and the lawsuit turns into a murder charge. Realizing that his fraud can't continue forever, Mike leaves newly renamed Pearson Specter to take a position as an investment banker.\n\n===Season 4 (2014\u201315)===\n{{main|Suits (season 4)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nMike's new job puts him and Harvey on opposite sides of a takeover battle, causing the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] to accuse them of collusion. When Mike is fired, Louis goes to extreme lengths to persuade Mike to come back to Pearson Specter, rather than working for shady billionaire investor Charles Forstman. Louis demands a name partner position, competing with Harvey, but his wrongdoings get him fired instead. When he realizes Mike never went to Harvard, he blackmails Jessica into rehiring him with the promotion he desired. Mike proposes to Rachel; Donna leaves Harvey to work for Louis.\n\n===Season 5 (2015\u201316)===\n{{main|Suits (season 5)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nHarvey struggles with losing Donna and begins to open up to a therapist about his broken relationship with his mother. Louis' insecurity, however, and desire to undermine Harvey create an opening for Jack Soloff, an ambitious partner who is being manipulated by Hardman. Rachel's wedding plans and her relationship with her parents are both overshadowed by Mike's secret. Mike and Harvey both resign to protect their future, but Mike is abruptly arrested for fraud. More and more people involved realize the allegations are true, and facing a tenacious prosecutor Anita Gibbs, Mike accepts a plea bargain, pleads guilty, and turns himself in so that no one else will go to jail. At the wedding, Mike tells Rachel that he will not marry her now but if she still wants him in two years then he will marry her after getting out of prison. Harvey escorts him to prison making their last few goodbyes.\n\n===Season 6 (2016\u201317)===\n{{main|Suits (season 6)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nA two-year prison sentence puts Mike at the mercy of Frank Gallo, an inmate with a grudge against Harvey. At Pearson Specter Litt, few employees remain to help. Rachel works an [[Innocence Project]] case for her law professor; Jessica assists pro bono but is distracted from matters at the firm, and chooses to leave her position to pursue her own life. Mike's cellmate proves pivotal in a deal for Mike's freedom. He struggles with his fraud being public knowledge but obtains a job at a legal clinic. Harvey helps both Rachel and Mike pass the Bar, and persuades Mike to come back to the firm.\n\n===Season 7 (2017\u201318)===\n{{main|Suits (season 7)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. -->\nEveryone at the firm struggles to adjust to a new normal without Jessica. Donna takes a position as COO, and Harvey's friend Alex joins the team. Harvey begins dating his former therapist, Paula; Louis sees a therapist of his own, with mixed results. Rachel begins her career as an attorney, having passed the Bar. Mike continues to work pro bono cases at the clinic, with Harvey's blessing, but one of the cases puts Alex, Harvey and others at risk. Louis and Sheila reconnect; as does [[Pearson (TV series)|Jessica with her family in Chicago]]. Mike and Rachel accept a job offer in [[Seattle]] to run their own firm that takes on class-action suits, and get married before leaving. As the season closes, a case that puts Specter Litt in danger is found to be the work of Robert Zane's partners, Rand and Kaldor. When Zane finds out, he joins forces with Specter Litt.\n\n===Season 8 (2018\u201319)===\n{{main|Suits (season 8)}}\nAs Mike and Rachel leave after getting married, Robert Zane is now the managing partner of Zane Specter Litt, with Donna remaining in her COO role. Robert hires a new senior partner, his right hand and fixer Samantha Wheeler. Wheeler later becomes a name partner alongside Alex Williams. Louis learns that Sheila is pregnant. Katrina Bennett makes senior partner, and struggles with romantic feelings for her married personal associate. Donna and Harvey finally admit their feelings for one another as Season 8 ends, but Donna's mishandling of client/boyfriend Thomas Kessler forces Zane to sacrifice his legal career for the good of the firm.\n\n=== Season 9 (2019) ===\n{{Main|Suits (season 9)}}\nWith Robert now disbarred, Faye Richardson, a special master from the bar is sent to oversee the firm due to the perception of the underhanded tactics they have been involved with for years.

Korsh and his agent took the script to several production companies and wanted to give the script to [[Universal Media Studios]].  However, Korsh found it odd that the studio did not want to sell the script to [[NBC]], the network the studio typically worked with.  Korsh's agent convinced USA Network executive Alex Sepiol that although the series was neither a [[Procedural (genre)|procedural]] nor what the network typically did, he would like the characters.  Sepiol approved of the script, and by then, Hypnotic Films & Television signed on to the project.  The team pitched the script to USA network, which bought the script after the pitch. Korsh did not pitch it to anyone else.  When rewriting the script, Korsh made only small changes to the first half-hour, up to when Mike is hired.  Originally, Mike did not take [[LSAT]]s for others and only pretends to have attended Harvard, as opposed to pretending he attended Harvard and has a law degree.  Korsh noted that there is no degree or test needed, to work on Wall Street and be a mathematical genius, unlike the [[bar examination]] in law.  He decided to \"embrace\" this difference and change the premise.<ref name=\"Korsh Interview THR\">{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title='Suits' Originally Set on Wall Street Before Getting Retooled for USA, Says Creator|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/suits-originally-set-wall-street-205066|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=August 9, 2012|date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe pilot episode was filmed in New York City, where the series is set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suits-star-gabriel-macht-prefers-257698 | title='Suits' Star Gabriel Macht Prefers Shooting Hit Legal Drama in NYC, Over Toronto | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012|author=Vlessing, Etan}}</ref>  The rest of the series is filmed in Toronto (at Downsview Park Studios), where the sets are built to be identical to the New York law offices seen in the pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poptimal.com/2011/06/suits-set-report-welcoming-a-new-show-with-open-arms/#.UCP08U2PWSp | title=Suits Set Report: Welcoming a New Show with Open Arms | publisher=[[Poptimal]] | date=June 25, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012 |author=Jaar, Stephanie}}</ref> To promote the series debut, USA had an advance screening of the pilot on June 2, 2011, at the [[Hudson River Park]] and distributed free [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]] Sundaes cones at the viewing.<ref name=\"Ice Cream Publicity TFC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/27/usa-network-kicks-off-sizzling-summer-with-entertainment-weekly-and-the-haagen-dazs-brand-506115/20110527usa02/|title=USA Network Kicks Off Sizzling Summer With Entertainment Weekly and the Haagen-Dazs(R) Brand | publisher=The Futon Critic |date=May 27, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://poptimal.com/2011/06/usa-networks-summer-of-originals-screenings-pier-perfection/#.UCPNlk2PWSo | title=USA Network's Summer of Originals Screenings: Pier Perfection | publisher=[[Poptimal]] | date=June 5, 2011 | accessdate=August 9, 2012 | author=Sellitti, Renata}}</ref>  The network also had a branded ice cream carts, bikes, and scooters give away at the Sundaes and USA/''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 2011 promotion summer guides on June 22 and 23.

The federally recognized [[Oneida Indian Nation]] has had a reservation in the region since the late 18th century, after the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nOneida County is part of the [[Utica, New York|Utica]]\u2013[[Rome, New York|Rome]], NY [[Utica\u2013Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nWhen England established colonial counties in the Province of New York in 1683, the territory of present Oneida County was included in a very large, mostly undeveloped [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This county included the northern part of present-day New York State as well as all of the present state of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extended westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 to create [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] in the Mohawk River Valley, and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. Tryon County was later divided to organize 37 distinct counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nDuring and after the Revolution, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Americans changed the name of Tryon County to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] to honor the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]]. They replaced the name of the British governor.\n\nIn 1789, Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] from Montgomery. The area taken from Montgomery County contained all of present-day [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties, as well as Ontario County.\n\nAfter continued new settlement, in 1791 [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] was one of three counties taken from Montgomery (the other two being [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]], and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]). It was much larger than the present Herkimer County, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.\n\nIn 1794, Herkimer County was reduced in size by the creation of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], and part of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] counties.\n\nIn 1798, Oneida County was created from another part of Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Oneida County, as it included the present-day [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson]] (which extends along Lake Ontario), [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis]], and part of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] counties.\n\nIn 1805, [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson]] and [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis]] counties were split off from Oneida. In 1816, parts of Oneida and Onondaga counties were taken to form the new [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]].\n\nIn 1848, [[John Humphrey Noyes]] founded a religious and [[Utopian]] community, the [[Oneida Community]], near Oneida.  Its unconventional views on religion and relations between the sexes generated much controversy. The community lasted until 1881. The [[Oneida Silver Company]] was founded here to manufacture sterling silver, silverplate holloware and, later, stainless steel flatware.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1258|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1212|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|45|sqmi}} (3.6%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOneida County is in the central portion of New York State, east of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and west of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. [[Oneida Lake]] is on the [[Ordinal directions|northwestern]] corner of the county, and the [[Adirondack Park]] is on the northeast. Part of the [[Tug Hill Plateau]] is in the northern part of the county. Oneida County's highest point lies neither on the plateau nor in the Adirondack Park, but in the county's southern extremity. The peak's name is Tassel Hill. It is located slightly southeast of Hardscrabble Road (Tassel Hill Road), between the villages of Waterville and Cassville.\n\nThe [[Erie Canal]], completed in 1825, runs east-west along the Mohawk River through the county. It stimulated considerable trade and settlement. [[Oneida Lake]] and [[Oneida Creek]] form part of the western boundary.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Oneida is the only county in New York state documented as having [[Chronic wasting disease]] among its wild [[White-tailed deer]].<ref>[http://www.cwd-info.org/index.php/fuseaction/recommendations.gmu Chronic Wasting Disease] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725044714/http://www.cwd-info.org/index.php/fuseaction/recommendations.gmu |date=July 25, 2011 }}.

The county executive is elected by the entire county. On January 1, 2014, the Oneida County Legislature was reduced to 23 seats. All 23 members of the legislature are elected from single member districts.

He won all municipalities in the county except the city of [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and the town of [[Kirkland, New York|Kirkland]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe main product of Oneida County was once silverware, chiefly manufactured at Oneida Ltd.'s headquarters in [[Sherrill, New York|Sherrill]].  In January 2005, the company ceased manufacturing their product, closing its main plant and selling its assets. The factory, under new ownership, continues to produce American-made silverware under the [[Liberty Tabletop]] brand.\n\nCurrently the largest non-governmental, non-healthcare product of Oneida County is gambling.  Turning Stone Casino Resort is an enterprise of the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, and the largest private employer in Oneida

The federally recognized [[Oneida Indian Nation]] has had a reservation in the region since the late 18th century, after the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nOneida County is part of the [[Utica, New York|Utica]]\u2013[[Rome, New York|Rome]], NY [[Utica\u2013Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nWhen England established colonial counties in the Province of New York in 1683, the territory of present Oneida County was included in a very large, mostly undeveloped [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This county included the northern part of present-day New York State as well as all of the present state of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extended westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 to create [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] in the Mohawk River Valley, and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. Tryon County was later divided to organize 37 distinct counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nDuring and after the Revolution, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Americans changed the name of Tryon County to [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]] to honor the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]]. They replaced the name of the British governor.\n\nIn 1789, Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] from Montgomery. The area taken from Montgomery County contained all of present-day [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties, as well as Ontario County.\n\nAfter continued new settlement, in 1791 [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]] was one of three counties taken from Montgomery (the other two being [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]], and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]). It was much larger than the present Herkimer County, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.\n\nIn 1794, Herkimer County was reduced in size by the creation of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]], and part of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] counties.\n\nIn 1798, Oneida County was created from another part of Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Oneida County, as it included the present-day [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson]] (which extends along Lake Ontario), [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis]], and part of [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] counties.\n\nIn 1805, [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson]] and [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis]] counties were split off from Oneida. In 1816, parts of Oneida and Onondaga counties were taken to form the new [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego County]].\n\nIn 1848, [[John Humphrey Noyes]] founded a religious and [[Utopian]] community, the [[Oneida Community]], near Oneida.  Its unconventional views on religion and relations between the sexes generated much controversy. The community lasted until 1881. The [[Oneida Silver Company]] was founded here to manufacture sterling silver, silverplate holloware and, later, stainless steel flatware.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1258|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1212|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|45|sqmi}} (3.6%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOneida County is in the central portion of New York State, east of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and west of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. [[Oneida Lake]] is on the [[Ordinal directions|northwestern]] corner of the county, and the [[Adirondack Park]] is on the northeast. Part of the [[Tug Hill Plateau]] is in the northern part of the county. Oneida County's highest point lies neither on the plateau nor in the Adirondack Park, but in the county's southern extremity. The peak's name is Tassel Hill. It is located slightly southeast of Hardscrabble Road (Tassel Hill Road), between the villages of Waterville and Cassville.\n\nThe [[Erie Canal]], completed in 1825, runs east-west along the Mohawk River through the county. It stimulated considerable trade and settlement.

King Edward promises to return lands to the nobility in exchange for their [[homage (feudal)|homage]]. After the formalities have ended, Bruce spars with Edward's heir, the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]], and the King weds Bruce to his goddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]]. [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|James Douglas]] arrives to ask for the restoration of his ancestral lands but is dismissed by Edward, on the basis of the previous Lord Douglas's treason. The King and the Prince depart from Scotland, leaving its management to Comyn and Bruce, under the supervision of the Earl of Pembroke, [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]]. Elizabeth arrives to marry Bruce. On the wedding night, he respects his reluctant wife's wishes and delays the consummation. Bruce witnesses Englishmen conscripting his servants to the King's army. Not long after, his father, the [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Lord of Annandale]], passes away, lamenting the loss of his friendship with the King of England, while admitting it may have been a mistake to trust Edward.\n\nTwo years later, after collecting taxes, Bruce notes how unpopular the English are. There is rioting after the public display of the [[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartered]] body of [[William Wallace]], which spurs Bruce to plan another revolt. He discusses the issue with his family, who agree with him. Bruce tries to persuade John Comyn to join him, but the latter refuses and threatens to inform Edward about the plan. In a panic, Bruce stabs Comyn to death. The incident compels the clergy of Scotland to offer a pardon to Bruce, bargaining that he supports the Catholic Church in Scotland and he accepts the [[Crown of Scotland]]. Bruce accepts the deal, but King Edward soon hears of it. He declares Bruce an outlaw and, at his son's request, sends the Prince of Wales to crush the uprising, under the dragon banner, symbolizing the abandonment of chivalry and representing King Edward's order that no quarter to be shown to any supporter of Bruce.\n\nBruce calls a council of the nobles, where most refuse to break their oaths to Edward. Despite the lack of expected support, Bruce heads to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], where he is to be crowned. On the road, he encounters Douglas, who pledges his allegiance if Robert will help Douglas reclaim his birthright. In Scone, Bruce is crowned [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scots]]. The ambitious de Valence decides to move against Bruce before the Prince arrives. Bruce wishes to avoid bloodshed and challenges de Valence to single combat. De Valence accepts but insists on delaying the duel a day, as it is Sunday. During the night, at Methven, Bruce finally consummates his marriage, but the English launch a surprise attack. Bruce sends his wife and [[Marjorie Bruce]], to safety with his brother [[Nigel de Brus|Nigel]], and stays to fight a [[Battle of Methven|losing battle]], during which most of the Scottish army is killed. Bruce escapes with fifty men. The group takes [[Aonghus \u00d3g of Islay|Angus]]' advice and flees to [[Islay]]. While traveling there, [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall]] parleys with them. He is bitter about the murder of his cousin Comyn but allows the army to pass but later [[Battle of Loch Ryan|attacks]] Bruce's entourage as they're trying to cross [[Loch Ryan]]. Some of them get away in boats, but they cannot prevent the death of Robert the Bruce's brother [[Alexander de Brus|Alexander]].\n\nPrince Edward arrives in Scotland and searches for Bruce at [[Kildrummy Castle]], only to find Bruce's wife, daughter, and brother. The sadistic prince has his brother hanged and drawn, and has Bruce's daughter and wife taken to England. Bruce's company meets up with Lord Mackinnon, who refuses to lend them any men. The band presses on with their voyage to Islay anyway; there, they learn of the fall of Kildrummy Castle. Bruce decides to take back the castle through stealth. The successful operation inspires Bruce to begin [[guerilla warfare]]. Shortly thereafter, Bruce is reunited with his other brother, [[Thomas de Brus|Thomas]]. In England, Marjorie is separated from her stepmother Elizabeth to be given religious instruction by nuns. After Edward hears that [[Douglas Castle]] has been re-taken, he goes after Bruce himself. He offers Elizabeth a pardon if she will annul her marriage to Robert, but she refuses and is placed in a hanging cage.\n\nThe following year, King Edward dies shortly after arriving in Scotland, and the Prince of Wales takes control of his father's forces. In defiance of his father's dying wishes, he orders his late father's burial in Scotland. Bruce decides to fight the new king in a [[pitched battle]] at [[Loudoun Hill]], despite being outnumbered six to one. Clan Mackinnon arrives to aid Bruce. Edward's army is composed almost entirely of cavalry, so Robert overcomes this army's size disadvantage by ensuring that during [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|the battle]],  the English cavalry charge into a spear wall hidden by a ditch, and thus incur heavy losses. Many horsemen attempt to attack the flanks but become bogged down in the mud, just as the Scots anticipated. As the English knights fall from their horses, many are slain, and the battle becomes an open brawl, wherein the ferocious Scots prevail over the disoriented English soldiers. Realising the battle is hopeless, de Valence orders a retreat. However, determined to kill his nemesis, Edward does not join the retreat.

In truth, he began his rebellion a full year after  Wallace's death. During the intermediate period, Edward I became suspicious of Robert I and ordered him to stay at Kildrummy Castle.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\" />\n\nThe film shows Robert I marrying Elizabeth de Burgh after surrendering to Edward I. In reality, Bruce's second marriage occurred years before in 1302. \n\nThe film's depiction of Edward II's role in the Battle of Loudoun Hill is heavily flawed. It is unlikely that he was present at the battle in any capacity. Moreover, it is certain that he would not have challenged Bruce to [[single combat]]. Even if he had been present and challenged Bruce to personal combat, a hostage as valuable as Edward II would not have been allowed to flee.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyhistory.org/How_Historically_Accurate_is_the_Outlaw_King%3F |website=Dailyhistory|title=How Historically Accurate is the Outlaw King?|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe title character in ''Outlaw King'' is that of an enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to its inhabitants. However, historian Fiona Watson notes the real Robert I was most likely cold, canny, and driven by his personal ambition.<ref name=\"Scotsman\">{{cite web |last1=Finlay |first1=Greig |title=What 'Outlaw King' gets wrong - according to a historian |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/film/what-outlaw-king-gets-wrong-according-to-a-historian-1-4829285 |website=Scotsman.com |language=en|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe color yellow is mostly absent from the clothing of the fighting men. In contrast, yellow dye was not only the most common dye in Scotland during the period, it was highly favored by the fighters with the means to afford it.

On the contrary, Edward II was reluctant to assume the mantle of kingship and was known to be generous with his servants.<ref name=\"Ranker\" />\n\nThe film portrays Edward I dying before the battle of Loudoun Hill when, in actuality, he died several months later. Furthermore, the film implies that Edward I was buried where he died when, in fact, he was interred at Westminster Abbey in London.\n\nIn the film, when Robert I tells his brothers about his plan to start a rebellion, [[artichoke]]s can be seen on the table.

King Edward promises to return lands to the nobility in exchange for their [[homage (feudal)|homage]]. After the formalities have ended, Bruce spars with Edward's heir, the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]], and the King weds Bruce to his goddaughter, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]]. [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|James Douglas]] arrives to ask for the restoration of his ancestral lands but is dismissed by Edward, on the basis of the previous Lord Douglas's treason. The King and the Prince depart from Scotland, leaving its management to Comyn and Bruce, under the supervision of the Earl of Pembroke, [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]]. Elizabeth arrives to marry Bruce. On the wedding night, he respects his reluctant wife's wishes and delays the consummation. Bruce witnesses Englishmen conscripting his servants to the King's army. Not long after, his father, the [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Lord of Annandale]], passes away, lamenting the loss of his friendship with the King of England, while admitting it may have been a mistake to trust Edward.\n\nTwo years later, after collecting taxes, Bruce notes how unpopular the English are. There is rioting after the public display of the [[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartered]] body of [[William Wallace]], which spurs Bruce to plan another revolt. He discusses the issue with his family, who agree with him. Bruce tries to persuade John Comyn to join him, but the latter refuses and threatens to inform Edward about the plan. In a panic, Bruce stabs Comyn to death. The incident compels the clergy of Scotland to offer a pardon to Bruce, bargaining that he supports the Catholic Church in Scotland and he accepts the [[Crown of Scotland]]. Bruce accepts the deal, but King Edward soon hears of it. He declares Bruce an outlaw and, at his son's request, sends the Prince of Wales to crush the uprising, under the dragon banner, symbolizing the abandonment of chivalry and representing King Edward's order that no quarter to be shown to any supporter of Bruce.\n\nBruce calls a council of the nobles, where most refuse to break their oaths to Edward. Despite the lack of expected support, Bruce heads to [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], where he is to be crowned. On the road, he encounters Douglas, who pledges his allegiance if Robert will help Douglas reclaim his birthright. In Scone, Bruce is crowned [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scots]]. The ambitious de Valence decides to move against Bruce before the Prince arrives. Bruce wishes to avoid bloodshed and challenges de Valence to single combat. De Valence accepts but insists on delaying the duel a day, as it is Sunday. During the night, at Methven, Bruce finally consummates his marriage, but the English launch a surprise attack. Bruce sends his wife and [[Marjorie Bruce]], to safety with his brother [[Nigel de Brus|Nigel]], and stays to fight a [[Battle of Methven|losing battle]], during which most of the Scottish army is killed. Bruce escapes with fifty men. The group takes [[Aonghus \u00d3g of Islay|Angus]]' advice and flees to [[Islay]]. While traveling there, [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall]] parleys with them. He is bitter about the murder of his cousin Comyn but allows the army to pass but later [[Battle of Loch Ryan|attacks]] Bruce's entourage as they're trying to cross [[Loch Ryan]]. Some of them get away in boats, but they cannot prevent the death of Robert the Bruce's brother [[Alexander de Brus|Alexander]].\n\nPrince Edward arrives in Scotland and searches for Bruce at [[Kildrummy Castle]], only to find Bruce's wife, daughter, and brother. The sadistic prince has his brother hanged and drawn, and has Bruce's daughter and wife taken to England. Bruce's company meets up with Lord Mackinnon, who refuses to lend them any men. The band presses on with their voyage to Islay anyway; there, they learn of the fall of Kildrummy Castle. Bruce decides to take back the castle through stealth. The successful operation inspires Bruce to begin [[guerilla warfare]]. Shortly thereafter, Bruce is reunited with his other brother, [[Thomas de Brus|Thomas]]. In England, Marjorie is separated from her stepmother Elizabeth to be given religious instruction by nuns. After Edward hears that [[Douglas Castle]] has been re-taken, he goes after Bruce himself. He offers Elizabeth a pardon if she will annul her marriage to Robert, but she refuses and is placed in a hanging cage.\n\nThe following year, King Edward dies shortly after arriving in Scotland, and the Prince of Wales takes control of his father's forces. In defiance of his father's dying wishes, he orders his late father's burial in Scotland. Bruce decides to fight the new king in a [[pitched battle]] at [[Loudoun Hill]], despite being outnumbered six to one. Clan Mackinnon arrives to aid Bruce. Edward's army is composed almost entirely of cavalry, so Robert overcomes this army's size disadvantage by ensuring that during [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|the battle]],  the English cavalry charge into a spear wall hidden by a ditch, and thus incur heavy losses. Many horsemen attempt to attack the flanks but become bogged down in the mud, just as the Scots anticipated. As the English knights fall from their horses, many are slain, and the battle becomes an open brawl, wherein the ferocious Scots prevail over the disoriented English soldiers. Realising the battle is hopeless, de Valence orders a retreat. However, determined to kill his nemesis, Edward does not join the retreat. Instead, he engages in a duel with Bruce as the Scots look on. Although Bruce prevails, he allows Edward to leave unharmed.

In truth, he began his rebellion a full year after  Wallace's death. During the intermediate period, Edward I became suspicious of Robert I and ordered him to stay at Kildrummy Castle.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\" />\n\nThe film shows Robert I marrying Elizabeth de Burgh after surrendering to Edward I. In reality, Bruce's second marriage occurred years before in 1302. \n\nThe film's depiction of Edward II's role in the Battle of Loudoun Hill is heavily flawed. It is unlikely that he was present at the battle in any capacity. Moreover, it is certain that he would not have challenged Bruce to [[single combat]]. Even if he had been present and challenged Bruce to personal combat, a hostage as valuable as Edward II would not have been allowed to flee.<ref name=\"dailyhistory\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailyhistory.org/How_Historically_Accurate_is_the_Outlaw_King%3F |website=Dailyhistory|title=How Historically Accurate is the Outlaw King?|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe title character in ''Outlaw King'' is that of an enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to its inhabitants.

Site of the Roman town of [[Casinum]], it is best known for its abbey, the first house of the [[Benedictine Order]], having been established by [[Benedict of Nursia]] himself around 529. It was for the community of Monte Cassino that the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] was composed.\n\nThe first monastery on Monte Cassino was sacked by the invading [[Lombards]] around 570 and abandoned. Of the first monastery almost nothing is known. The second monastery was established by [[Petronax of Brescia]] around 718, at the suggestion of Pope [[Pope Gregory II|Gregory II]] and with the support of the Lombard Duke [[Romuald II of Benevento]]. It was directly subject to the pope and many monasteries in Italy were under its authority. In 883 the monastery was sacked by [[Saracens]] and abandoned again. The community of monks resided first at [[Teano]] and then from 914 at [[Capua]] before the monastery was rebuilt in 949. During the period of exile, the [[Cluniac Reforms]] were introduced into the community.\n\nThe 11th and 12th centuries were the abbey's golden age. It acquired a large secular territory around Monte Cassino, the so-called ''[[Terra Sancti Benedicti]]'' (\"Land of Saint Benedict\"), which it heavily fortified with [[castle]]s. It maintained good relations with the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]], even receiving patronage from [[Byzantine emperors]]. It encouraged fine art and craftsmanship by employing Byzantine and even Saracen artisans. In 1057, Pope [[Pope Victor II|Victor II]] recognised the abbot of Monte Cassino as having precedence over all other abbots. Many monks rose to become bishops and cardinals, and three popes were drawn from the abbey: [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen IX]] (1057\u201358), [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]] (1086\u201387) and [[Pope Gelasius II|Gelasius II]] (1118\u201319). During this period [[Chronicon monasterii Casinensis|the monastery's chronicle]] was written by two of its own, Cardinal [[Leo of Ostia]] and [[Peter the Deacon]] (who also compiled the [[cartulary]]).\n\nBy the 13th century, the monastery's decline had set in. In 1239, the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] garrisoned troops in it during his war with the Papacy. In 1322, Pope [[John XXII]] elevated the abbey into a bishopric but this was suppressed in 1367. The buildings were destroyed by an earthquake in 1349, and in 1369 Pope [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]] demanded a contribution from all Benedictine monasteries to fund the rebuilding. In 1454 the abbey was placed ''[[in commendam]]'' and in 1504 was made subject to the [[Abbey of Santa Giustina]] in Padua.\n\nIn 1799, Monte Cassino was sacked again by French troops during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The abbey was dissolved by the Italian government in 1866. The building became a national monument with the monks as custodians of its treasures. In 1944 during [[World War II]] it was the site of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] and the building was destroyed by Allied bombing. It was rebuilt after the war.\n\nAfter the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] the monastery was one of the few remaining [[territorial abbey]]s within the [[Catholic Church]]. On 23 October 2014, Pope [[Pope Francis|Francis]] applied the norms of the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Ecclesia Catholica'' of [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] (1976)<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholica Ecclesia|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19761023_catholica-ecclesia.html|website=Holy See}}</ref> to the abbey, removing from its jurisdiction all 53 parishes and reducing its spiritual jurisdiction to the abbey itself\u2014while retaining its status as a territorial abbey. The former territory of the Abbey, except the land on which the abbey church and monastery sit, was transferred to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sora-Cassino-Aquino-Pontecorvo|diocese of Sora-Cassino-Aquino-Pontecorvo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Vatican announces reorganisation of Montecassino Abbey|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/10/23/vatican_announces_reorganisation_of_montecassino_abbey/1109281|publisher=Vatican Radio|date=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican-reorganizes-montecassino-mother-abbey-of-the-benedictines-93663/|publisher=Catholic News Agency|title=Vatican reorganizes Montecassino, mother abbey of the Benedictines|date=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Ancient history===\nThe history of Monte Cassino is linked to the nearby town of Cassino which was first settled in the fifth century B.C. by the [[Volsci]] people who held much of central and southern Italy. It was the Volsci who first built a citadel on the summit of Monte Cassino. The Volsci in the area were defeated by the Romans in 312 B.C. The Romans renamed the settlement [[Casinum]] and built a temple to Apollo at the citadel. Modern excavations have found no remains of the temple, but ruins of an amphitheatre, a theatre, and a mausoleum indicate the lasting presence the Romans had there.<ref name=IDHP/>\n\nGenerations after the Roman Empire adopted Christianity the town became the seat of a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monte Cassino|bishopric]] in the fifth century A.D. Lacking strong defences the area was subject to barbarian attack and became abandoned and neglected with only a few struggling inhabitants holding out.<ref name=IDHP>{{cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Volume 3 Southern Europe|editor1=by Trudy Ring |editor2=Robert M. Salkin |editor3=Sharon La Boda |year=1995|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|location=Chicago, IL|page=132}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval history===\nAccording to [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great's]] biography of [[Benedict of Nurcia|Benedict]], ''Life of Saint Benedict of Nursia'', the monastery was constructed on an older pagan site, a [[temple]] of [[Apollo]] that crowned the hill. The biography records that the area was still largely [[Paganism|pagan]] at the time; Benedict's first act was to smash the sculpture of Apollo and destroy the altar. He then reused the temple, dedicating it to [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], and built another chapel on the site of the altar dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]].\n\nPope Gregory I's account of Benedict's seizure of Monte Cassino:\n<blockquote>\"Now the citadel called Casinum is located on the side of a high mountain. The mountain shelters this citadel on a broad bench. Then it rises three miles above it as if its peak tended toward heaven. There was an ancient temple there in which Apollo used to be worshipped according to the old pagan rite by the foolish local farmers. Around it had grown up a grove dedicated to demon worship, where even at that time a wild crowd still devoted themselves to unholy sacrifices. When [Benedict] the man of God arrived, he smashed the idol, overturned the altar and cut down the grove of trees. He built a chapel dedicated to St. Martin in the temple of Apollo and another to St. John where the altar of Apollo had stood. And he summoned the people of the district to the faith by his unceasing preaching.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Life of Saint Benedict|author=Pope Gregory I|translator=Terrence Kardong, OSB|section=7:10-11|page=49|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=2009|location=Collegeville, MN}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPope Gregory I's biography of Benedict claims that Satan opposed the monks repurposing the site. In one story, Satan invisibly sits on a rock making it too heavy to remove until Benedict drives him off. In another story, Satan taunts Benedict and then collapses a wall on a young monk, who is brought back to life by Benedict. Pope Gregory also relays that the monks found a pagan idol of bronze when digging at the site (which when thrown into the kitchen gave the illusion of a fire until dispelled by Benedict).<ref name=Pope>{{cite book|title=The Life of Saint Benedict|author=Pope Gregory I|translator=Terrence Kardong, OSB|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=2009|location=Collegeville, MN}}</ref>\n\nArchaeologist [[Neil Christie]] notes that it was common in such [[hagiography|hagiographies]] for the protagonist to encounter areas of strong paganism.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2006|p=113}}</ref> Benedict scholar Terrence Kardong examines why Benedict did not face stiffer opposition in his seizure of the site from the local pagans. He contrasts this with the 25-year struggle faced by St. Martin of Tours in western Gaul by pagans angry at his attacks on their shrines: \"By the time of Benedict, paganism was in a weaker condition in western Europe than it had been in Martin's time. And, of course, it must be remembered that Martin as a bishop was a much more prominent churchman than Benedict. This was an isolated and unusual episode in Benedict's monastic career. Martin, however, was thrust out of his monastery into the role of a missionary bishop in the fourth century.\"<ref name=Pope/>\n\nBenedict scholars (such as Adalbert de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 and Terrence Kardong) note the heavy influence of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of Martin'' on Pope Gregory I's biography of Benedict, including the account of his seizure of Monte Cassino. Benedict's violence against a pagan holy place recalls both Martin's assault against pagan shrines generations before and the Biblical story of conquering Israel entering the Holy Land (see Exodus 34:12-14). De Vogue writes \"this mountain had to be conquered from an idolatrous people and purified from its devilish horrors. And like conquering Israel, Benedict came precisely to carry out this purification. No doubt Gregory had this biblical model uppermost in his mind, as is clear from the terms he uses to describe the work of destruction. At the same time, neither Gregory nor Benedict could have forgotten the similar line of action taken by St. Martin against the pagan shrines of Gaul.\"<ref name=Vogue>{{cite book|title=The Life of St. Benedict|author=Gregory the Great|others=Commentary by Adalbert de Vog\u00fc\u00e9|translator=Hilary Costello and Eoin de Bhaldraithe|publisher=St. Bede's Publications|location=Petersham, MA|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nPope Gregory I's account of Benedict at Monte Cassino is seen by scholars as the final setting for an epic set in motion at Subiaco. In his earlier setting Benedict \"had twice shown complete mastery over his aggressiveness, Benedict is now allowed to use it without restraint in the service of God.\"<ref name=Vogue/> Scholars note that this striking contrast is not stressed by Gregory but rather both settings are portrayed as part of a single battle account against the same demonic enemy. Where Satan concealed himself behind underlings at Subiaco, at Monte Cassino he drops the masks to enter into a desperate attempt to prevent an abbey from being built, and \"that the sole cause of this eruption of satanic action is the suppression of pagan worship on the high places.\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\nWhile scholars see some similarities between the story of Benedict's encountering demonic phenomena and diabolic apparitions at Monte Cassino with the story of Saint [[Anthony the Great]]'s temptation in the desert, the influence of the story of St. Martin is dominant \u2013 with the resistance of Satan substituting for Martin's outraged pagan populace. Unlike the stories that may have influenced Pope Gregory's structure of the biography, Benedict's victories are practical, preventing Satan from stopping work on the abbey at Monte Cassino. Benedict's prayers are portrayed as the driving force behind the building of the abbey and the triumphs over Satan, through prayer \"Benedict the monk wrests from the devil a well-determined base which he never leaves.\"<ref name=Vogue/> After the completion of the abbey, Satan's appearances in the story diminish back to the same level as Subiaco, \"Only after the saint's death and by God's permission would other enemies, the Lombards, succeed in sacking it.\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\nOnce established at Monte Cassino, Benedict never left. He wrote the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Rule]] that became the founding principle for Western [[monasticism]], received a visit from [[Totila]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] (perhaps in 543, the only remotely secure historical date for Benedict), and died there. According to accounts, \"Benedict died in the oratory of St. Martin, and was buried in the oratory of St. John.\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\nThe Rule of St. Benedict mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick. So in Monte Cassino St. Benedict founded a hospital that is considered today to have been the first in Europe of the new era. Benedictine monks took care of the sick and wounded there according to Benedict's Rule. The monastic routine called for hard work. The care of the sick was such an important duty that those caring for them were enjoined to act as if they served Christ directly. Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at nearby Subiaco (about 64&nbsp;km to the east of Rome), where hospitals were settled, too, as adjuncts to the monasteries to provide charity. Soon many monasteries were founded throughout Europe, and everywhere there were hospitals like those in Monte Cassino.\n\nPope Gregory I's account of Benedict's construction was confirmed by archaeological discoveries made after the destruction of 1944. Adalbert de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 recounts that \"Traces have been found of the oratories of St. Martin and of St. John the Baptist, with additions from the eighth and eleventh centuries, together with their pre-Christian cellars. The first one which Benedict built in the temple itself was only twelve meters long and eight wide. From this, we can infer a fairly small community. The second oratory, on the mountain-top, where the pagan altar had stood in the open air, was of the same width but somewhat longer (15.25 meters).\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\n[[File:Monte Sammucro - 200512.jpg|thumb|left|View across the valley]]\nMonte Cassino became a model for future developments. Its prominent site has always made it an object of strategic importance. It was sacked or destroyed a number of times. \"The first to demolish it were Lombards on foot in 580; the last were Allied bombers in 1944.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Anne | last = Fremantle | authorlink = Anne Fremantle | title = The Age of Faith | publisher = Time-Life Books | year = 1965 | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0652686104}}</ref> In 581, during the abbacy of [[Bonitus (abbot)|Bonitus]], the [[Lombards]] sacked the abbey, and the surviving monks fled to Rome, where they remained for more than a century. During this time the body of St Benedict was transferred to Fleury, the modern [[Saint-Beno\u00eet-sur-Loire|Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire]] near Orleans, France.\n\nA flourishing period of Monte Cassino followed its re-establishment in 718 by [[Petronax of Monte Cassino|Abbot Petronax]], when among the monks were [[Carloman, Mayor of the Palace|Carloman]], son of [[Charles Martel]]; [[Ratchis]], predecessor of the great Lombard Duke and King [[Aistulf]]; and [[Paul the Deacon]], the historian of the Lombards.\n\nIn 744, a donation of [[Gisulf II of Benevento]] created the ''[[Terra Sancti Benedicti]]'', the secular lands of the abbacy, which were subject to the abbot and nobody else save the Pope. Thus, the monastery became the capital of a state comprising a compact and strategic region between the Lombard [[Duchy of Benevento|principality of Benevento]] and the [[Byzantine]] city-states of the coast ([[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]).\n\nIn 884 [[Saracen]]s sacked and then burned it down,<ref>{{cite book | first = Will | last = Durant | title = The Age of Faith: A History of Medieval Civilization - Christian, Islamic, and Judaic - from Constantine to Dante: A.D. 325-1300 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1950 | page = 290}}</ref> and Abbot [[Bertharius]] was killed during the attack. Among the great historians who worked at the monastery, in this period there is [[Erchempert]], whose ''Historia Langobardorum Beneventanorum'' is a fundamental chronicle of the ninth-century [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]].\n\n[[File:Monte Cassino Fasada Kosciol.JPG|thumb|The fa\u00e7ade of the church]]\n\n===Rebuilding, library, and later medieval history===\nMonte Cassino was rebuilt and reached the apex of its fame in the 11th century under the abbot Desiderius (abbot 1058\u20131087), who later became [[Pope Victor III]]. Monks caring for the patients in Monte Cassino constantly needed new medical knowledge. So they began to buy and collect medical and other books by Greek, Roman, Islamic, Egyptian, European, Jewish, and Oriental authors. As Naples is situated on the crossroad of many seaways of Europe, Middle East and Asia, soon the monastery library was one of the richest in Europe. All the knowledge of the civilizations of all the times and nations was accumulated in the Abbey of that time. The Benedictines translated into Latin and transcribed precious manuscripts. The number of monks rose to over two hundred, and the library, the manuscripts produced in the [[scriptorium]] and the school of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]] became famous throughout the West. The unique [[Beneventan script]] flourished there during Desiderius' abbacy.\nMonks reading and copying the medical texts learnt a lot about human anatomy and methods of treatment, and then put their theoretic skills into practice at monastery hospital. By the 10-11th centuries Monte Cassino became the most famous cultural, educational, and medical center of Europe with great library in Medicine and other sciences. Many physicians came there for medical and other knowledge. That is why the first [[Schola Medica Salernitana|High Medical School]] in the world was soon opened in nearby [[Salerno]] which is considered today to have been the earliest Institution of Higher Education in Western Europe. This school found its original base in the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Cassino still in the 9th century and later settled down in Salerno.  So, Montecassino and Benedictines played a great role in the progress of medicine and science in the Middle Ages, and with his life and work St. Benedict himself exercised a fundamental influence on the development of European civilization and culture and helped Europe to emerge from the \"dark night of history\" that followed the fall of the Roman empire.\n\nThe buildings of the monastery were reconstructed in the 11th century on a scale of great magnificence, artists being brought from Amalfi, Lombardy, and even [[Constantinople]] to supervise the various works. The abbey church, rebuilt and decorated with the utmost splendor, was consecrated in 1071 by [[Pope Alexander II]]. A detailed account of the abbey at this date exists in the ''Chronica monasterii Cassinensis'' by [[Leo of Ostia]] and [[Amatus of Montecassino|Amatus of Monte Cassino]] gives us our best source on the early [[Normans]] in the south.\n\nAbbot Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert [[Byzantine mosaic]]ists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler [[Leo of Ostia]] the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). \"The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts\" - says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.\n\nArchitectural historian [[Kenneth John Conant]] believed that Desiderius' rebuilding included pointed arches, and served as a major influence in the nascent development of [[Gothic architecture]]. Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]] visited Monte Cassino in 1083, and five years later he began to build the third church at [[Cluny Abbey]], which then included pointed arches and became a major turning point in medieval architecture.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Verde  | first = Tom\n | title = The Point of the Arch\n | journal = Aramco World\n | volume = May/June 2012\n | url = http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201203/the.point.of.the.arch.htm}}</ref>\n\nAn earthquake damaged the Abbey in 1349, and although the site was rebuilt it marked the beginning of a long period of decline. In 1321, [[Pope John XXII]] made the church of Monte Cassino a cathedral, and the carefully preserved independence of the monastery from episcopal interference was at an end. That situation was reversed by [[Pope Urban V]], a Benedictine, in 1367.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Tomassetti, Aloysius|title=Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCxOAQAAMAAJ|edition=Tomus IV|year=1859|publisher=Seb.

From the dissolution of the Italian monasteries in 1866, Monte Cassino became a national monument.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0004, Italien, Monte Cassino.jpg|thumb|left|Monte Cassino in ruins after [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing in February 1944.]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]] (January\u2013May 1944) the Abbey was heavily damaged. The German military forces had established the 161-kilometre (100-mile) [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]], in order to prevent Allied troops from advancing northwards. The abbey itself however, was not initially utilised by the German troops as part of their fortifications, owing to General [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring]]'s regard for the historical monument. The Gustav Line stretched from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] to the [[Adriatic]] coast in the east, with Monte Cassino itself overlooking Highway 6 and blocking the path to Rome. On 15 February 1944 the abbey was almost completely destroyed in a series of heavy American-led air raids. The Commander-in-Chief Allied Armies in Italy, General Sir [[Harold Alexander]] of the British army ordered the bombing.  The bombing was conducted because many reports from the British commanders of the Indian troops on the ground suggested that Germans were occupying the monastery, and it was considered a key observational post by all those who were fighting in the field.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-i-landed-war-was-over?page=6 \"When I Landed the War Was over\"], by [[Hughes Rudd]], ''American Heritage'', October/November 1981.</ref> However, during the bombing no Germans were present in the abbey.

Site of the Roman town of [[Casinum]], it is best known for its abbey, the first house of the [[Benedictine Order]], having been established by [[Benedict of Nursia]] himself around 529. It was for the community of Monte Cassino that the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] was composed.\n\nThe first monastery on Monte Cassino was sacked by the invading [[Lombards]] around 570 and abandoned. Of the first monastery almost nothing is known. The second monastery was established by [[Petronax of Brescia]] around 718, at the suggestion of Pope [[Pope Gregory II|Gregory II]] and with the support of the Lombard Duke [[Romuald II of Benevento]]. It was directly subject to the pope and many monasteries in Italy were under its authority. In 883 the monastery was sacked by [[Saracens]] and abandoned again. The community of monks resided first at [[Teano]] and then from 914 at [[Capua]] before the monastery was rebuilt in 949. During the period of exile, the [[Cluniac Reforms]] were introduced into the community.\n\nThe 11th and 12th centuries were the abbey's golden age. It acquired a large secular territory around Monte Cassino, the so-called ''[[Terra Sancti Benedicti]]'' (\"Land of Saint Benedict\"), which it heavily fortified with [[castle]]s. It maintained good relations with the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]], even receiving patronage from [[Byzantine emperors]]. It encouraged fine art and craftsmanship by employing Byzantine and even Saracen artisans. In 1057, Pope [[Pope Victor II|Victor II]] recognised the abbot of Monte Cassino as having precedence over all other abbots. Many monks rose to become bishops and cardinals, and three popes were drawn from the abbey: [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen IX]] (1057\u201358), [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]] (1086\u201387) and [[Pope Gelasius II|Gelasius II]] (1118\u201319). During this period [[Chronicon monasterii Casinensis|the monastery's chronicle]] was written by two of its own, Cardinal [[Leo of Ostia]] and [[Peter the Deacon]] (who also compiled the [[cartulary]]).\n\nBy the 13th century, the monastery's decline had set in. In 1239, the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] garrisoned troops in it during his war with the Papacy. In 1322, Pope [[John XXII]] elevated the abbey into a bishopric but this was suppressed in 1367. The buildings were destroyed by an earthquake in 1349, and in 1369 Pope [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]] demanded a contribution from all Benedictine monasteries to fund the rebuilding. In 1454 the abbey was placed ''[[in commendam]]'' and in 1504 was made subject to the [[Abbey of Santa Giustina]] in Padua.\n\nIn 1799, Monte Cassino was sacked again by French troops during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. The abbey was dissolved by the Italian government in 1866. The building became a national monument with the monks as custodians of its treasures. In 1944 during [[World War II]] it was the site of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] and the building was destroyed by Allied bombing. It was rebuilt after the war.\n\nAfter the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] the monastery was one of the few remaining [[territorial abbey]]s within the [[Catholic Church]]. On 23 October 2014, Pope [[Pope Francis|Francis]] applied the norms of the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Ecclesia Catholica'' of [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] (1976)<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholica Ecclesia|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19761023_catholica-ecclesia.html|website=Holy See}}</ref> to the abbey, removing from its jurisdiction all 53 parishes and reducing its spiritual jurisdiction to the abbey itself\u2014while retaining its status as a territorial abbey.

It was the Volsci who first built a citadel on the summit of Monte Cassino. The Volsci in the area were defeated by the Romans in 312 B.C. The Romans renamed the settlement [[Casinum]] and built a temple to Apollo at the citadel. Modern excavations have found no remains of the temple, but ruins of an amphitheatre, a theatre, and a mausoleum indicate the lasting presence the Romans had there.<ref name=IDHP/>\n\nGenerations after the Roman Empire adopted Christianity the town became the seat of a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monte Cassino|bishopric]] in the fifth century A.D.

The biography records that the area was still largely [[Paganism|pagan]] at the time; Benedict's first act was to smash the sculpture of Apollo and destroy the altar. He then reused the temple, dedicating it to [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], and built another chapel on the site of the altar dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]].\n\nPope Gregory I's account of Benedict's seizure of Monte Cassino:\n<blockquote>\"Now the citadel called Casinum is located on the side of a high mountain. The mountain shelters this citadel on a broad bench. Then it rises three miles above it as if its peak tended toward heaven. There was an ancient temple there in which Apollo used to be worshipped according to the old pagan rite by the foolish local farmers. Around it had grown up a grove dedicated to demon worship, where even at that time a wild crowd still devoted themselves to unholy sacrifices. When [Benedict] the man of God arrived, he smashed the idol, overturned the altar and cut down the grove of trees. He built a chapel dedicated to St. Martin in the temple of Apollo and another to St. John where the altar of Apollo had stood. And he summoned the people of the district to the faith by his unceasing preaching.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Life of Saint Benedict|author=Pope Gregory I|translator=Terrence Kardong, OSB|section=7:10-11|page=49|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=2009|location=Collegeville, MN}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPope Gregory I's biography of Benedict claims that Satan opposed the monks repurposing the site. In one story, Satan invisibly sits on a rock making it too heavy to remove until Benedict drives him off. In another story, Satan taunts Benedict and then collapses a wall on a young monk, who is brought back to life by Benedict. Pope Gregory also relays that the monks found a pagan idol of bronze when digging at the site (which when thrown into the kitchen gave the illusion of a fire until dispelled by Benedict).<ref name=Pope>{{cite book|title=The Life of Saint Benedict|author=Pope Gregory I|translator=Terrence Kardong, OSB|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=2009|location=Collegeville, MN}}</ref>\n\nArchaeologist [[Neil Christie]] notes that it was common in such [[hagiography|hagiographies]] for the protagonist to encounter areas of strong paganism.<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|2006|p=113}}</ref> Benedict scholar Terrence Kardong examines why Benedict did not face stiffer opposition in his seizure of the site from the local pagans. He contrasts this with the 25-year struggle faced by St. Martin of Tours in western Gaul by pagans angry at his attacks on their shrines: \"By the time of Benedict, paganism was in a weaker condition in western Europe than it had been in Martin's time. And, of course, it must be remembered that Martin as a bishop was a much more prominent churchman than Benedict. This was an isolated and unusual episode in Benedict's monastic career. Martin, however, was thrust out of his monastery into the role of a missionary bishop in the fourth century.\"<ref name=Pope/>\n\nBenedict scholars (such as Adalbert de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 and Terrence Kardong) note the heavy influence of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of Martin'' on Pope Gregory I's biography of Benedict, including the account of his seizure of Monte Cassino. Benedict's violence against a pagan holy place recalls both Martin's assault against pagan shrines generations before and the Biblical story of conquering Israel entering the Holy Land (see Exodus 34:12-14). De Vogue writes \"this mountain had to be conquered from an idolatrous people and purified from its devilish horrors. And like conquering Israel, Benedict came precisely to carry out this purification. No doubt Gregory had this biblical model uppermost in his mind, as is clear from the terms he uses to describe the work of destruction. At the same time, neither Gregory nor Benedict could have forgotten the similar line of action taken by St. Martin against the pagan shrines of Gaul.\"<ref name=Vogue>{{cite book|title=The Life of St. Benedict|author=Gregory the Great|others=Commentary by Adalbert de Vog\u00fc\u00e9|translator=Hilary Costello and Eoin de Bhaldraithe|publisher=St. Bede's Publications|location=Petersham, MA|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nPope Gregory I's account of Benedict at Monte Cassino is seen by scholars as the final setting for an epic set in motion at Subiaco. In his earlier setting Benedict \"had twice shown complete mastery over his aggressiveness, Benedict is now allowed to use it without restraint in the service of God.\"<ref name=Vogue/> Scholars note that this striking contrast is not stressed by Gregory but rather both settings are portrayed as part of a single battle account against the same demonic enemy. Where Satan concealed himself behind underlings at Subiaco, at Monte Cassino he drops the masks to enter into a desperate attempt to prevent an abbey from being built, and \"that the sole cause of this eruption of satanic action is the suppression of pagan worship on the high places.\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\nWhile scholars see some similarities between the story of Benedict's encountering demonic phenomena and diabolic apparitions at Monte Cassino with the story of Saint [[Anthony the Great]]'s temptation in the desert, the influence of the story of St. Martin is dominant \u2013 with the resistance of Satan substituting for Martin's outraged pagan populace. Unlike the stories that may have influenced Pope Gregory's structure of the biography, Benedict's victories are practical, preventing Satan from stopping work on the abbey at Monte Cassino. Benedict's prayers are portrayed as the driving force behind the building of the abbey and the triumphs over Satan, through prayer \"Benedict the monk wrests from the devil a well-determined base which he never leaves.\"<ref name=Vogue/> After the completion of the abbey, Satan's appearances in the story diminish back to the same level as Subiaco, \"Only after the saint's death and by God's permission would other enemies, the Lombards, succeed in sacking it.\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\nOnce established at Monte Cassino, Benedict never left. He wrote the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Rule]] that became the founding principle for Western [[monasticism]], received a visit from [[Totila]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] (perhaps in 543, the only remotely secure historical date for Benedict), and died there. According to accounts, \"Benedict died in the oratory of St. Martin, and was buried in the oratory of St. John.\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\nThe Rule of St. Benedict mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick. So in Monte Cassino St. Benedict founded a hospital that is considered today to have been the first in Europe of the new era. Benedictine monks took care of the sick and wounded there according to Benedict's Rule. The monastic routine called for hard work. The care of the sick was such an important duty that those caring for them were enjoined to act as if they served Christ directly. Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at nearby Subiaco (about 64&nbsp;km to the east of Rome), where hospitals were settled, too, as adjuncts to the monasteries to provide charity. Soon many monasteries were founded throughout Europe, and everywhere there were hospitals like those in Monte Cassino.\n\nPope Gregory I's account of Benedict's construction was confirmed by archaeological discoveries made after the destruction of 1944. Adalbert de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 recounts that \"Traces have been found of the oratories of St. Martin and of St. John the Baptist, with additions from the eighth and eleventh centuries, together with their pre-Christian cellars. The first one which Benedict built in the temple itself was only twelve meters long and eight wide. From this, we can infer a fairly small community. The second oratory, on the mountain-top, where the pagan altar had stood in the open air, was of the same width but somewhat longer (15.25 meters).\"<ref name=Vogue/>\n\n[[File:Monte Sammucro - 200512.jpg|thumb|left|View across the valley]]\nMonte Cassino became a model for future developments. Its prominent site has always made it an object of strategic importance. It was sacked or destroyed a number of times. \"The first to demolish it were Lombards on foot in 580; the last were Allied bombers in 1944.\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Anne | last = Fremantle | authorlink = Anne Fremantle | title = The Age of Faith | publisher = Time-Life Books | year = 1965 | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0652686104}}</ref> In 581, during the abbacy of [[Bonitus (abbot)|Bonitus]], the [[Lombards]] sacked the abbey, and the surviving monks fled to Rome, where they remained for more than a century. During this time the body of St Benedict was transferred to Fleury, the modern [[Saint-Beno\u00eet-sur-Loire|Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire]] near Orleans, France.\n\nA flourishing period of Monte Cassino followed its re-establishment in 718 by [[Petronax of Monte Cassino|Abbot Petronax]], when among the monks were [[Carloman, Mayor of the Palace|Carloman]], son of [[Charles Martel]]; [[Ratchis]], predecessor of the great Lombard Duke and King [[Aistulf]]; and [[Paul the Deacon]], the historian of the Lombards.\n\nIn 744, a donation of [[Gisulf II of Benevento]] created the ''[[Terra Sancti Benedicti]]'', the secular lands of the abbacy, which were subject to the abbot and nobody else save the Pope. Thus, the monastery became the capital of a state comprising a compact and strategic region between the Lombard [[Duchy of Benevento|principality of Benevento]] and the [[Byzantine]] city-states of the coast ([[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]).\n\nIn 884 [[Saracen]]s sacked and then burned it down,<ref>{{cite book | first = Will | last = Durant | title = The Age of Faith: A History of Medieval Civilization - Christian, Islamic, and Judaic - from Constantine to Dante: A.D. 325-1300 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 1950 | page = 290}}</ref> and Abbot [[Bertharius]] was killed during the attack. Among the great historians who worked at the monastery, in this period there is [[Erchempert]], whose ''Historia Langobardorum Beneventanorum'' is a fundamental chronicle of the ninth-century [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]].\n\n[[File:Monte Cassino Fasada Kosciol.JPG|thumb|The fa\u00e7ade of the church]]\n\n===Rebuilding, library, and later medieval history===\nMonte Cassino was rebuilt and reached the apex of its fame in the 11th century under the abbot Desiderius (abbot 1058\u20131087), who later became [[Pope Victor III]]. Monks caring for the patients in Monte Cassino constantly needed new medical knowledge. So they began to buy and collect medical and other books by Greek, Roman, Islamic, Egyptian, European, Jewish, and Oriental authors. As Naples is situated on the crossroad of many seaways of Europe, Middle East and Asia, soon the monastery library was one of the richest in Europe. All the knowledge of the civilizations of all the times and nations was accumulated in the Abbey of that time. The Benedictines translated into Latin and transcribed precious manuscripts. The number of monks rose to over two hundred, and the library, the manuscripts produced in the [[scriptorium]] and the school of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]] became famous throughout the West. The unique [[Beneventan script]] flourished there during Desiderius' abbacy.\nMonks reading and copying the medical texts learnt a lot about human anatomy and methods of treatment, and then put their theoretic skills into practice at monastery hospital. By the 10-11th centuries Monte Cassino became the most famous cultural, educational, and medical center of Europe with great library in Medicine and other sciences. Many physicians came there for medical and other knowledge. That is why the first [[Schola Medica Salernitana|High Medical School]] in the world was soon opened in nearby [[Salerno]] which is considered today to have been the earliest Institution of Higher Education in Western Europe. This school found its original base in the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Cassino still in the 9th century and later settled down in Salerno.  So, Montecassino and Benedictines played a great role in the progress of medicine and science in the Middle Ages, and with his life and work St. Benedict himself exercised a fundamental influence on the development of European civilization and culture and helped Europe to emerge from the \"dark night of history\" that followed the fall of the Roman empire.\n\nThe buildings of the monastery were reconstructed in the 11th century on a scale of great magnificence, artists being brought from Amalfi, Lombardy, and even [[Constantinople]] to supervise the various works. The abbey church, rebuilt and decorated with the utmost splendor, was consecrated in 1071 by [[Pope Alexander II]]. A detailed account of the abbey at this date exists in the ''Chronica monasterii Cassinensis'' by [[Leo of Ostia]] and [[Amatus of Montecassino|Amatus of Monte Cassino]] gives us our best source on the early [[Normans]] in the south.\n\nAbbot Desiderius sent envoys to Constantinople some time after 1066 to hire expert [[Byzantine mosaic]]ists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler [[Leo of Ostia]] the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). \"The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts\" - says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.\n\nArchitectural historian [[Kenneth John Conant]] believed that Desiderius' rebuilding included pointed arches, and served as a major influence in the nascent development of [[Gothic architecture]]. Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]] visited Monte Cassino in 1083, and five years later he began to build the third church at [[Cluny Abbey]], which then included pointed arches and became a major turning point in medieval architecture.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Verde  | first = Tom\n | title = The Point of the Arch\n | journal = Aramco World\n | volume = May/June 2012\n | url = http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201203/the.point.of.the.arch.htm}}</ref>\n\nAn earthquake damaged the Abbey in 1349, and although the site was rebuilt it marked the beginning of a long period of decline. In 1321, [[Pope John XXII]] made the church of Monte Cassino a cathedral, and the carefully preserved independence of the monastery from episcopal interference was at an end. That situation was reversed by [[Pope Urban V]], a Benedictine, in 1367.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Tomassetti, Aloysius|title=Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCxOAQAAMAAJ|edition=Tomus IV|year=1859|publisher=Seb.

From the dissolution of the Italian monasteries in 1866, Monte Cassino became a national monument.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0004, Italien, Monte Cassino.jpg|thumb|left|Monte Cassino in ruins after [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing in February 1944.]]\nDuring the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]] (January\u2013May 1944) the Abbey was heavily damaged. The German military forces had established the 161-kilometre (100-mile) [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]], in order to prevent Allied troops from advancing northwards. The abbey itself however, was not initially utilised by the German troops as part of their fortifications, owing to General [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring]]'s regard for the historical monument. The Gustav Line stretched from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] to the [[Adriatic]] coast in the east, with Monte Cassino itself overlooking Highway 6 and blocking the path to Rome. On 15 February 1944 the abbey was almost completely destroyed in a series of heavy American-led air raids. The Commander-in-Chief Allied Armies in Italy, General Sir [[Harold Alexander]] of the British army ordered the bombing.  The bombing was conducted because many reports from the British commanders of the Indian troops on the ground suggested that Germans were occupying the monastery, and it was considered a key observational post by all those who were fighting in the field.<ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-i-landed-war-was-over?page=6 \"When I Landed the War Was over\"], by [[Hughes Rudd]], ''American Heritage'', October/November 1981.</ref> However, during the bombing no Germans were present in the abbey.
