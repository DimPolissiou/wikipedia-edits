At around this time, she began appearing in Italian films in minor roles.\n\nIn 1945, at age 18, she played a part in the comedy ''Santarellina'' by [[Eduardo Scarpetta]] at the [[Teatro della Concordia (Monte Castello di Vibio, Italy)|Teatro della Concordia]] of [[Monte Castello di Vibio]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} (It is the smallest [[Theater (structure)|theatre ''all'italiana'']] in the world.)<ref>[http://www.teatropiccolo.it/storie/8-sulla-scia-del-vento-giacobino/25-storie-vicende-protagonisti ''Storie, vicende e protagonisti / Stories, events and protagonists''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425014722/http://www.teatropiccolo.it/storie/8-sulla-scia-del-vento-giacobino/25-storie-vicende-protagonisti |date=25 April 2012 }} History of the Teatro della Concordia on the theatre's official website, 2011</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Lollobrigida entered the [[Miss Italia]] [[Beauty contest|pageant]] and came in third place, giving her national exposure.\n\n==Acting career==\n===Cinema===\nIn 1950, [[Howard Hughes]] signed Lollobrigida on a preliminary seven-year contract to make three pictures a year.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite magazine|title=Kept Out of Hollywood 8 Years, Lollobrigida Pretty Mad At Hughes|last=Werba|first=Hank|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 26, 1958|page=18|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n245/mode/1up|accessdate=July 7, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> She refused the final terms of the contract, preferring to remain in Europe and Hughes suspended her.<ref name=Hughes/> Despite selling [[RKO Pictures]] in 1955, Hughes retained Lollobrigida's contract.<ref name=Hughes/> The dispute prevented her from working in American movies filmed in the US until 1959, though not from working in American productions shot in Europe, although Hughes often threatened legal action against the producers.<ref name=Hughes/> \n\nHer performance in ''[[Bread, Love and Dreams]]'' (''Pane, amore e fantasia'', 1953) led to it becoming a box-office success<ref name=Hughes/> and her receiving a [[BAFTA]] nomination, and won a [[Nastro d'Argento]] award. Lollobrigida also appeared in ''[[The Wayward Wife]]'' (1953) and in ''[[Woman of Rome]]'' (1954). These were three of her most renowned Italian films, but she worked also in the [[French films|French industry]] on such films as ''Fearless Little Soldier'' (''[[Fanfan la Tulipe]]'', 1952), ''[[Beauties of the Night]]'' (''Les Belles de nuit'', also 1952) and ''[[Le Grand Jeu (1954 film)|Le Grand Jeu]]'' (1954).\n\nHer first widely seen English language film was ''[[Beat the Devil (film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953), a film which was shot in Italy.

She then took part in the Italian-American production ''[[Crossed Swords (1954 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1954), co-starring with [[Errol Flynn]]. Her appearance in ''The World's Most Beautiful Woman'' (also known as ''[[Beautiful But Dangerous]]'', 1955) led to her receiving the first [[David di Donatello for Best Actress]] award; in this film she interpreted the Italian soprano [[Lina Cavalieri]], singing some arias from [[Tosca]] with her own voice. She had the principal female lead in the circus drama ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956) directed by [[Carol Reed]] co-starring with [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Tony Curtis]] and in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1956), appeared as Esmeralda with [[Anthony Quinn]] as Quasimodo.

At around this time, she began appearing in Italian films in minor roles.\n\nIn 1945, at age 18, she played a part in the comedy ''Santarellina'' by [[Eduardo Scarpetta]] at the [[Teatro della Concordia (Monte Castello di Vibio, Italy)|Teatro della Concordia]] of [[Monte Castello di Vibio]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} (It is the smallest [[Theater (structure)|theatre ''all'italiana'']] in the world.)<ref>[http://www.teatropiccolo.it/storie/8-sulla-scia-del-vento-giacobino/25-storie-vicende-protagonisti ''Storie, vicende e protagonisti / Stories, events and protagonists''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425014722/http://www.teatropiccolo.it/storie/8-sulla-scia-del-vento-giacobino/25-storie-vicende-protagonisti |date=25 April 2012 }} History of the Teatro della Concordia on the theatre's official website, 2011</ref>\n\nIn 1947, Lollobrigida entered the [[Miss Italia]] [[Beauty contest|pageant]] and came in third place, giving her national exposure.\n\n==Acting career==\n===Cinema===\nIn 1950, [[Howard Hughes]] signed Lollobrigida on a preliminary seven-year contract to make three pictures a year.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite magazine|title=Kept Out of Hollywood 8 Years, Lollobrigida Pretty Mad At Hughes|last=Werba|first=Hank|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 26, 1958|page=18|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n245/mode/1up|accessdate=July 7, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> She refused the final terms of the contract, preferring to remain in Europe and Hughes suspended her.<ref name=Hughes/> Despite selling [[RKO Pictures]] in 1955, Hughes retained Lollobrigida's contract.<ref name=Hughes/> The dispute prevented her from working in American movies filmed in the US until 1959, though not from working in American productions shot in Europe, although Hughes often threatened legal action against the producers.<ref name=Hughes/> \n\nHer performance in ''[[Bread, Love and Dreams]]'' (''Pane, amore e fantasia'', 1953) led to it becoming a box-office success<ref name=Hughes/> and her receiving a [[BAFTA]] nomination, and won a [[Nastro d'Argento]] award. Lollobrigida also appeared in ''[[The Wayward Wife]]'' (1953) and in ''[[Woman of Rome]]'' (1954). These were three of her most renowned Italian films, but she worked also in the [[French films|French industry]] on such films as ''Fearless Little Soldier'' (''[[Fanfan la Tulipe]]'', 1952), ''[[Beauties of the Night]]'' (''Les Belles de nuit'', also 1952) and ''[[Le Grand Jeu (1954 film)|Le Grand Jeu]]'' (1954).\n\nHer first widely seen English language film was ''[[Beat the Devil (film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953), a film which was shot in Italy. In this film, directed by [[John Huston]], she played the wife of [[Humphrey Bogart]], with [[Jennifer Jones]] as her rival. She then took part in the Italian-American production ''[[Crossed Swords (1954 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1954), co-starring with [[Errol Flynn]]. Her appearance in ''The World's Most Beautiful Woman'' (also known as ''[[Beautiful But Dangerous]]'', 1955) led to her receiving the first [[David di Donatello for Best Actress]] award; in this film she interpreted the Italian soprano [[Lina Cavalieri]], singing some arias from [[Tosca]] with her own voice. She had the principal female lead in the circus drama ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956) directed by [[Carol Reed]] co-starring with [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Tony Curtis]] and in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1956), appeared as Esmeralda with [[Anthony Quinn]] as Quasimodo.

The latter was the last film directed by [[King Vidor]], and features an almost unique orgy scene in Hollywood motion pictures of that era; furthermore, [[Yul Brynner|Brynner]] was chosen to substitute for [[Tyrone Power]], who died before the shots were completed.\n\nIn the romantic comedy ''[[Come September]]'' (1961), Lollobrigida had a leading role along with [[Rock Hudson]], [[Sandra Dee]] and [[Bobby Darin]]. It was a film for which she won a [[Golden Globe Award]]. She appeared, also in 1961, with [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Anthony Franciosa]] in the drama ''[[Go Naked in the World]]''.\n[[File:Gina Lollobrigida Fata Turchina.jpg|thumb|upright|Lollobrigida as [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair]] in the TV series ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1972 miniseries)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (1972)]]\nJean Delannoy then directed her again, this time in ''[[Venere Imperiale]]'' (1962). She co-starred with [[Stephen Boyd]] and she received [[Nastro d'Argento]] and [[David di Donatello]] awards. She co-starred with [[Sean Connery]] in the thriller ''[[Woman of Straw]]'' (1964), with Rock Hudson again in ''[[Strange Bedfellows (1965 film)|Strange Bedfellows]]'' (1965) and appeared with [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[Hotel Paradiso (film)|Hotel Paradiso]]'' (1966).\n\nShe starred in ''[[Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell]]'' (1968) with [[Shelley Winters]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Peter Lawford]] and [[Telly Savalas]].

She revealed that was a great regret having refused a supporting role in [[La Dolce Vita]], wanted by [[Federico Fellini]]; about this, she added that, at the time, scripts arrived too much and her husband accidentally hid that one.\n\n===Television===\nIn the mid-1980s, she starred in the television series ''[[Falcon Crest]]'' as Francesca Gioberti, a role originally written for [[Sophia Loren]], who had turned it down. For that role she received a third Golden Globe nomination. She also had a supporting role in the 1985 television miniseries ''Deceptions'', co-starring with [[Stefanie Powers]]. The following year she appeared as guest star in the TV series ''[[The Love Boat]]''.\n\n==Judging==\nIn 1986, she was invited to head the jury at the [[36th Berlin International Film Festival]], which awarded the [[Golden Bear]] to [[Reinhard Hauff]]'s film ''[[Stammheim (film)|Stammheim]].''

The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other [[sacrifice|offering]] for the brownie, usually by the [[hearth]]. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they are sometimes said to turn malicious, like [[boggart]]s.\n\nBrownies originated as domestic [[Tutelary deity|tutelary]] spirits, very similar to the [[Lares]] of ancient Roman tradition. Descriptions of brownies vary regionally, but they are usually described as ugly, brown-skinned, and covered in hair. In the oldest stories, they are usually human-sized or larger. In more recent times, they have come to be seen as small and wizened. They are often capable of turning invisible and they sometimes [[Therianthropy|appear in the shapes of animals]]. They are always either naked or dressed in rags. If a person attempts to present a brownie with clothing or if a person attempts to [[Baptism|baptize]] him, he will leave forever.\n\nAlthough the name ''brownie'' originated as a dialectal word used only in northern England and Scotland, it has since become the standard term for all such creatures throughout [[Great Britain]]. Regional variants in England and Scotland include '''hobs''', '''silkies''', and '''\u00f9ruisgs'''. Variants outside England and Scotland are the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] '''Bwbach''' and the [[Manx language|Manx]] '''Fenodyree'''. Brownies have also appeared outside of folklore, including in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[L'Allegro]]''. They became popular in works of [[children's literature]] in the late nineteenth century and continue to appear in works of modern fantasy. The [[Brownies (Scouting)|Brownies]] in the [[Girl Guides]] are named after a short story by [[Juliana Horatia Ewing]] based on brownie folklore.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Vettii.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Roman [[Lararium]], or household shrine to the [[Lares]], from the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]].

as a '''{{lang|gd|br\u00f9naidh}}''' or '''{{lang|gd|gruagach}}''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]), is a [[household deity|household spirit]] from [[Great Britain|British]] [[folklore]] that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform various chores and farming tasks. The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other [[sacrifice|offering]] for the brownie, usually by the [[hearth]]. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they are sometimes said to turn malicious, like [[boggart]]s.\n\nBrownies originated as domestic [[Tutelary deity|tutelary]] spirits, very similar to the [[Lares]] of ancient Roman tradition. Descriptions of brownies vary regionally, but they are usually described as ugly, brown-skinned, and covered in hair. In the oldest stories, they are usually human-sized or larger. In more recent times, they have come to be seen as small and wizened. They are often capable of turning invisible and they sometimes [[Therianthropy|appear in the shapes of animals]]. They are always either naked or dressed in rags. If a person attempts to present a brownie with clothing or if a person attempts to [[Baptism|baptize]] him, he will leave forever.\n\nAlthough the name ''brownie'' originated as a dialectal word used only in northern England and Scotland, it has since become the standard term for all such creatures throughout [[Great Britain]]. Regional variants in England and Scotland include '''hobs''', '''silkies''', and '''\u00f9ruisgs'''. Variants outside England and Scotland are the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] '''Bwbach''' and the [[Manx language|Manx]] '''Fenodyree'''. Brownies have also appeared outside of folklore, including in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[L'Allegro]]''. They became popular in works of [[children's literature]] in the late nineteenth century and continue to appear in works of modern fantasy. The [[Brownies (Scouting)|Brownies]] in the [[Girl Guides]] are named after a short story by [[Juliana Horatia Ewing]] based on brownie folklore.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Vettii.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Roman [[Lararium]], or household shrine to the [[Lares]], from the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]].
