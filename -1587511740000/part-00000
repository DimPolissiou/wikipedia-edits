The premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for breaking rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, [[Ian Terry]] won the season by a 6\u20131 vote over runner-up [[Dan Gheesling]].<ref>Patrick Gomez,[http://people.com/tv/big-brother-14-winner-revealed/], ''People Magazine''>, September 20, 2012.

It was also the first to have two vetos at one veto ceremony.\n\nIn a change from past seasons, four former HouseGuests from past seasons of ''Big Brother'' returned to coach the new HouseGuests during their time in the House. Each coach had to pick three of the new HouseGuests that they will guide throughout the entire game. When a HouseGuests wins Head of Household the coach of that Housemate will also gain their own private room adjacent to the Head of Household bedroom. The coaches compete in a new competition that replaces Have vs. Have-Not competition for the season. The winning coach is granted the power to give one of their players immunity for the week or to trade one of their players for a player from another team. Depending on the rules of the coach's competition, each coach then has to choose one of their own players to become a \"Have Not\" for the week or the winning coach has the opportunity of choosing all of the \"Have Nots\". HouseGuests that are chosen to be \"Have Nots\" for the week had to eat \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food restriction (chosen by the viewing public), take cold showers, and sleep on hard beds. The coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize and the $50,000 runner-up prize but instead were to be awarded a separate $100,000 prize if one of their chosen HouseGuests wins Big Brother. However, on Week 3, America voted to allow the coaches to vote whether to keep coaching or become HouseGuests. Three of four voted to reset the game, and all coaches earned HouseGuest status, now eligible to win the $500,000 grand prize.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n\nA total of sixteen HouseGuests entered the house, the same number of HouseGuests competing in ''[[Big Brother 9 (American season)|Big Brother 9]]''.

However, unlike previous seasons where the returning players competed as regular HouseGuests, the veterans were tasked with coaching three of the new players. Upon entering the house, the coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize, and were instead competing to win a separate prize of $100,000, which would be awarded to the coach of the winning HouseGuest. However, after the July 26 live eviction episode, viewers were allowed to vote on whether or not to give the coaches the option of entering the game as regular players for the $500,000 prize. On August 2, America's Vote was revealed. The result was to offer the coaches the option of entering the game. Julie Chen revealed that each coach would be called into the Diary Room individually to cast their vote to keep coaching or not. Inside the diary room was a reset button, signifying the game's reset for the coaches. If at least one coach decides to reset, all coaches would earn HouseGuest status. A 3\u20131 vote brought the coaches into the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; \n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Age on entry\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Occupation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Residence\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Big Brother'' History\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Big Brother 14'' results\n|-\n!

He finished in 12th place. Jodi Rollins made a brief Cameo on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S. season)|first season]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Britney Haynes returned for ''[[Big Brother 20 (U.S. season)|Big Brother 20]]'' where she celebrated the engagement of two-time ''Big Brother'' houseguest Nicole Franzel and season 18 houseguest Victor Arroyo. Haynes and [[Janelle Pierzina]] competed as a team in ''[[The Amazing Race 31]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nOn the first night, twelve new HouseGuests entered the Big Brother House to two new twists of the season. The first twist was that four successful ex-HouseGuests would re-enter the House not to compete against one another, but to coach the new HouseGuests. Their job is to guide the HouseGuests for as long as they can, hoping to keep coaching a possible winner. The winner's coach would win a special $100,000 prize at the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, [[Dan Gheesling]] from ''[[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|Big Brother 10]]'', Britney Haynes from ''[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|Big Brother 12]]'', Mike \"Boogie\" Malin from ''[[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|Big Brother 2]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'', and [[Janelle Pierzina]] from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'' entered the House. On the second twist of the night, HouseGuests were informed that their status in the game were at risk. Because Big Brother sent the HouseGuests \"invitations\" to enter the House instead of a key, the HouseGuests had to earn their status in the first Head of Household competition as there were only eleven keys to be earned. Therefore, for the first time in ''Big Brother'' history, one HouseGuest would be evicted by the end of the first night. That night, Janelle and Britney forged an alliance after Dan and Boogie agreed to working together.\n\nBefore the HouseGuests competed in their first Head of Household competition, the coaches assigned their teammates. The coaches chose one by one and in order, Britney chose Shane, Willie, and JoJo; Mike chose Frank, Ian, and Jenn; Janelle chose Wil, Ashley, and Joe; and Dan chose Kara, Danielle, and Jodi. The HouseGuests other than the coaches competed in the first Head of Household competition. Each teammate had to jump across large moving mattresses to retrieve life-sized teddy bears (Upon the competition's completion, one of the HouseGuests, Frank, kept his teddy bear; calling him \"Teddy B\"). After twenty minutes, teams were allowed to substitute one teammate. Team Britney won the Head of Household competition, and Team Dan came in last place, giving Dan the responsibility to evict one of his players. On Day 1, Dan cast the sole vote to evict Jodi. Mike won the first coaches competition of the season called \"Big Brother Derby\" and won the power to grant one of his teammates immunity for the week: He chose Ian. The four coaches each had to choose one of their teammates to be a Have-Not for the week, with Ashley, Ian, Shane, and Danielle getting picked. Frank and Kara were nominated for eviction on Day 5. On Day 7, Shane won the Power of Veto competition, \"Loose Change\", which involved HouseGuests running around and trying to find coin props (one dollar coin, quarter and five cent coins). Once they find them they had to throw the coin props from a distance to a machine. Once they threw a total of $1.30 in coin props, they would win the Power of Veto. Shane decided to leave Willie's nominations the same. On Day 13, Kara was evicted in a 5 to 3 vote, leaving Danielle as Dan's only team member left. It was also revealed the winner of the next Coaches Competition would have the option of either saving one of his or her players or trading them with another player.\n\nFollowing Kara's eviction, Frank won the Head of Household competition, \"Big Brother Break-In\".  The HouseGuests had to determine whether a burglar that entered the house was guilty or not guilty of a certain crime. HouseGuests were eliminated by answering incorrectly. Janelle won the second coaches competition, \"Phat Stacks\", and chose to give Ashley immunity from the nominations. She also single-handedly chose the four Have-Nots for the week: Willie, Shane, JoJo, and Ian. On Day 14, Willie was [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|expelled]] from the house, after going on a rampage in which he threw pork rinds at Janelle, swore at the female HouseGuests, and headbutted Joe. Minutes later, JoJo and Shane were nominated for eviction. On Day 15, Shane won the ''Memory Chip'' Power of Veto competition, in which HouseGuests had to run around dressed as [[Tortilla chip|salsa chips]] and dive into different pools of salsa and find different menu items names and then they had to bring the names and put them in correct order in their menu as it is on a menu at which they could look at. The HouseGuest that got most of the names in the correct order in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. Shane removed himself from the block, and Frank then nominated Danielle for eviction. When JoJo and Shane were flirting in the have-not room one night, Ian told Danielle about this and thus, Danielle told Janelle's and Boogie's players. On Day 20, JoJo was evicted by a vote of 5 to 1, only receiving the vote of Shane.\n\nFollowing JoJo's eviction, Shane won the \"On Thin Ice\" HoH competition. The HouseGuests shot balls into a slotted end of an ice rink that had scores for each slot. Host [[Julie Chen]] then revealed to the viewers they could vote on whether or not the mentors should be allowed to enter the game. On Day 21, the HouseGuests went to the Big Brother Gym for their coaches competition \"Feel the Burn\". Their goal was to do as many exercises of a certain type. The coach who would do the least would be eliminated. When they were eliminated they had the chance to open a locker and possibly win something. Britney chose Ian and Joe as Have-Nots, Mike Boogie won $10,000 that he shared with Ian whom he gave $3,000 and Jenn who received $1,000. Dan had the opportunity to invite five people to a private sushi & cocktail party. He chose Boogie, Britney, Janelle, Shane & Danielle. Janelle won the Coaches Competition and saved Wil. Later that day, Shane nominated Ashley and Joe for eviction. Also on Day 21; Shane, Ashley, Joe, Wil, Danielle, and Frank had been chosen to compete in the Veto Competition. On Day 22, all had competed in ''The Juggler'' Veto Competition, where each HouseGuest had to roll back and forth two balls at the same time on two different ramps. If even one of the balls would fall, that person would be out. Shane won the Power of Veto for the third week in a row. On Day 24, Shane used the Power of Veto on Ashley, nominating Frank in her place. Before the live eviction took place on Day 27, Julie Chen announced that America has chosen to give the coaches the opportunity to play the game and stop coaching. If the coaches voted to become players, the eviction would be canceled and everyone would play in the HoH, including Shane. However, if the coaches chose to keep the game the same, the eviction would continue, but one evicted HouseGuest would return the following week. Julie Chen also announced that only one vote was required to reset the entire game. One by one, the coaches were called into the Diary Room whether to hit the \"Reset Button\" or not. Britney, Dan and Janelle chose to hit the button, while Mike Boogie did not. With the vote of 3\u20131, the coaches were reverted to HouseGuest status and Joe and Frank were spared eviction.\n\nAll hounded HouseGuests then began to participate in the \"[[Walking the plank|Walk the Plank]]\" HoH endurance competition, in which the HouseGuests had to hold on to a bar. If they fell from the plank, they would be eliminated. After a nearly four-hour battle, Danielle became the new HoH, outlasting Britney and Ian. On Day 28, Danielle nominated Frank and Wil for eviction. Danielle won the Power of Veto from the \"Field of Veto\" competition on Day 29. Later, Boogie made a huge pitch to Danielle by using the veto and backdoor his long-time rival Janelle. A few hours later, all 4 coaches came up to the HOH room and Boogie called out Janelle on her lies. So Dan made an offer to her, if Frank gets vetoed, then Joe goes up. But when Janelle refused to answer, Dan knew that the possibility of all 4 coaches working together has blown up and he has no choice but to accept Boogie's offer on backdooring Janelle. On Day 30, Britney, Dan, Danielle, Frank, Mike Boogie and Shane created the \"Silent Six\" alliance and conspired to backdoor Janelle. On Day 31, Danielle went through with the plan and used the Power of Veto on Wil and put up Janelle as a replacement nominee. On Day 34, Janelle was evicted by an 8 to 1 vote with Joe as her only vote and became the first returning HouseGuest to leave the show and also marking the first time Janelle has not reached the final three.\n\nFollowing Janelle's eviction, on Day 34, all HouseGuests, with the exception of Danielle as the outgoing HoH, competed in the \"[[Battle of the Bands|Big Brother Battle of the Bands]]\" HoH competition, in which Frank became the new Head of Household for the second time this season. On Day 35, all HouseGuests competed in the Have/Have Not competition ''E-Squeeze Me?'', except for Ashley who was having back spasms and could not compete. Frank played in her spot. Britney, Danielle, Joe and Shane became the Have Nots for the week, making this week the first week Ian is a Have. On Day 35, Frank nominated Joe and Wil for eviction. The next night, the HouseGuests competed in the Power of Veto competition, ''Birth of Zingbot'', which Frank won. Before the Veto meeting, Wil and Ashley came to Frank and made a pitch on backdooring Dan. But when Boogie heard about this from Frank, he said to Frank, \"If you put up Dan, then it's 8 versus 2 and it's game over for us.\" So at the veto meeting, Frank then decided to keep his nominations the same. On Day 41, Wil was evicted by a 6 to 2 vote.\n\nFollowing Wil's eviction, on Day 41, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Swamped\" Head of Household Competition. The first HouseGuest to fill up the HoH jug with liquid and release the cork would win. There were two other jugs as well. One was safety and the other was a choice between $10,000 or a Have Not Pass decided by the viewers voting for $10,000. Britney won safety, Mike Boogie won $10,000, and Shane won his second HoH competition and became the new Head of Household. After the HOH competition, Boogie told Ian his targets would be Britney and Shane for the future. But Ian went on to warn them about Boogie and Frank and they cannot be trusted anymore. On Day 42, Shane went against his \"Silent Six\" alliance in favor of his second alliance (The Quack Pack) by nominating Frank and Mike Boogie for eviction. After the nomination ceremony, Boogie and Frank were lashing at Dan believing he was the mastermind behind their nominations. But unbeknownst to them, their ally Ian was the \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" Frank then won his second straight Power of Veto in the [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|controversial]] Veto competition, ''The Candy Counter''. Frank then used the Veto to save himself from nominations and Shane chose to nominate Jenn as the replacement. On Day 48, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was a Double Eviction night. For the first of the two evictions, Mike Boogie was evicted by a vote of 5\u20132. During the double eviction, Ian won the \"Before or After\" HoH and immediately nominated Ashley and Frank for eviction. Frank then won his third straight Power of Veto of the season in \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Veto]]\" and took himself off the block. Ian named Joe as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second eviction, Ashley was evicted by a vote of 5\u20131 and became the first member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Boogie and Ashley's eviction, Frank became the new Head of Household and got to choose one HouseGuest to become the Have Not for the week. Frank decided to choose Dan. On Day 49, Frank was given an option to open Pandora's Box. Frank decided to open Pandora's Box and received a little over $3,000, but unleashed quarters in the backyard to play the skill crane game, containing a Golden Ball of Veto. Ian got the ball and won the veto, but in doing so he sacrificed his chance to play in the week's POV competition. Later that day, Frank chose to nominate Dan and Danielle for eviction. On Day 50, the HouseGuests (with the exception of host Ian, who had to sit out since he already had the Golden Ball of Veto, and Joe, who wasn't chosen) played in the Power of Veto competition [[Draw Something]], which was made after the app of the same name. Jenn won her first competition of the summer after Frank was disqualified from the competition for whispering an answer to Britney during her turn. On Day 51, in one of the greatest game moves in \"Big Brother\" history, Dan came up with a master plan to get himself off the block by hosting his own \"funeral\" after having 24 hours of solitary confinement to think on how he was going to get out of this mess. First, he gathered everyone in the living room and paid compliments to his fellow HouseGuests. He thanked Joe for teaching him how to be a good husband, called Shane the \"real\" Captain America, and told Jenn that she was the first lesbian he'd ever met and that he appreciated how much she has touched his heart. He bonded with Britney over their status as newlyweds praised Ian for making the experience of being in the Big Brother house more fun. To Frank, Dan said that he wanted to apologize one-on-one after the funeral about some things he had said. However, for Danielle, he said that he thought that she had similar qualities to Dan's closest friend and ally Memphis Garrett from Big Brother 10, but he found out that he was wrong. He said to her that \"You'll never earn my trust back, you know what you did, and in this game you are dead to me.\" Later, he managed to strike a final two deal with Frank, his nemesis in the house and exposed the Quack Pack to him, telling that Ian was responsible for Boogie's eviction, not Dan. They manage to strike a final two deal and proposed a new alliance with Jenn and Danielle. Following this, he did some damage control to Danielle about the \"funeral\" and said that it was all an act and he used her emotions just to get them further in the game. Then, he said that he wanted to work with Frank and Jenn along with her. Thus, the two then went to Jenn in hopes of her using the veto to remove Dan from the block. On Day 52, Ian decided not to use his veto, while Jenn went through with the plan and Britney was shockingly put up as the replacement nominee, completely blindsiding Ian and Britney. Later, Ian and Frank had a huge fight over him betraying Mike \"Boogie\" and also putting Frank up on the block with Ashley in exchange for Frank giving Ian $3,000 during the Coaches' Competition in week 3. On Day 55, Britney was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, only receiving the vote of Ian and became the second member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Britney's eviction on Day 55, the HouseGuests competed in an endurance HoH competition called \"[[Soak Up the Sun]]\". In the competition, players had to hold onto a rope as it moved around a sun on the ground. With 51% of the public Twitter poll cast during the live show, America voted the first HouseGuest to drop out to have a punishment over a reward. Joe, for being the first to drop, was given a [[hula hoop]] and was required to use it every time Big Brother sounded [[Reveille]]. It was revealed that 5 hours before the previous live show began, Ian tells Dan he wants to reunite the Quack Pack and to tell him that he's not mad at Dan for what he did this week, but his main concern is that Dan will try to work with Frank and Jenn along with Danielle. So after Ian talked to Dan, Dan told Shane about Ian's idea of reuniting the Quack Pack and he wants go all the way to final four with him, Ian and Danielle. Ian outlasted all the HouseGuests and won HoH less than two hours later. On Day 56, Pandora's Box was presented again and Ian opted to open it, releasing small presents (along with a new hammock for the backyard). Ian also received $1,000 in prize money. However, ''Big Brother 10'' and ''11''{{'}}s Jessie Godderz was also released into the house, replacing all of their junk food and snacks with healthy, organic food for the week. On Day 56, Ian nominated Frank and Jenn for eviction. On Day 57, Dan won the Power of Veto competition which featured the return of OTEV. On Day 59, Dan decided to return the favor to Jenn (who vetoed him last week) and used the Veto on her. Ian nominated Joe in her place. On Day 62, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was another double eviction night. For the first of two evictions, Frank was evicted by a vote of 3\u20131 and became the third member of the jury, with Jenn being the only voter to evict Joe. Immediately afterwards, Dan won the \"Make Your Case\" Head of Household competition after a tiebreaker question with Jenn and Danielle. A few minutes later, Dan nominated both Ian and Joe for eviction with Ian as Dan's main target. Ian then won the \"[[Swimming with Sharks]]\" Power of Veto competition and removed himself from the block. Dan named Danielle as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second double eviction, Joe was evicted by a vote of 3\u20130 and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Frank and Joe's eviction, Ian won the \"Memory Lane\" Head of Household competition, making this his third HoH win and tying him with Frank for the most HoH wins so far this season. On Day 63, Ian opened Pandora's Box thereby giving the other HouseGuests video messages from home while he talked to [[Rachel Reilly]] from ''Big Brother 12'' and ''13''. Later that day, Ian nominated Jenn and Shane for eviction. On Day 64, Shane won the Power of Veto and a prize. On Day 65, Shane and Danielle went on a luxury prize to the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastic Champions. On Day 66, Shane decided to use the Power of Veto to save himself from the block, and in return, Ian nominated Danielle as the replacement. On Day 68, Jenn was evicted by a vote of 2\u20130 and became the fifth member of the jury. On Day 68, Danielle won her second HoH competition of the season \"Photographic Memory\", and went on to nominate Dan and Ian for eviction. On Day 68, Danielle won the \"Atomic Veto\" competition, making it her second and final Veto of the season. After the veto competition, Dan asked Danielle to use the Veto on himself, to which Danielle would only agree if Dan would evict Ian and not Shane. On Day 69, Danielle used the Power of Veto on Dan, and was replaced by Shane. A few minutes later, the biggest blindside of the summer occurred as Dan chose to evict Shane, blindsiding Danielle and Shane. Shane became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Shane's eviction, Dan won the first part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" (similar to the \"King of The Jungle\" endurance HOH from season 10 in which Dan also won). On Day 71, Ian won the second part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Climb Time\". On Day 75, Ian won the third part of the final Head of Household, \"Jury Statements\" and became the final Head of Household of the season. Ian then evicted Danielle and chose Dan to take to the final two. The jury was allowed to ask questions to both Dan and Ian, who began to turn against each other. In the end, the jury voted for Ian to win the grand prize by a vote of 6 to 1 over Dan, with Danielle being the only person to vote for Dan. Before the finale ended, Julie Chen announced that Frank was the winner of the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize.\nIan Terry now has a record of 4 HOH wins, tying Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses both from Big Brother 17, Caleb Reynolds from Big Brother 16, Aaryn Gries from Big Brother 15, Rachel Reilly from Big Brother 13, Hayden Moss from Big Brother 12, Janelle Pierzina from Big Brother 7 and Drew Daniel from Big Brother 5.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

As the coach of the last-place team, Dan had to evict one member of his team on Day 1.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the first three weeks, the coaches participated in a competition that gave them the power to save or trade one of their players. In Week 2, the power of trading a player was introduced.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: Due to a violent outburst, Willie was expelled from the game by Big Brother on Day 14. Because Frank had not made nominations yet, Big Brother decided to allow the game to continue on as normal. In addition, Willie's expulsion prevented him from being a candidate for America's Favorite HouseGuest.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} Prior to the planned live eviction on Day 27, America voted to offer the coaches the opportunity to become HouseGuests and entering the main game. The coaches individually entered the Diary Room and were presented with a reset button. Pressing the button was acceptance of America's offer. If a coach did not press the button that meant declining the offer. \n** Had the button been pressed by at least one coach, the planned eviction would be cancelled and the game would reset - with the coaches becoming full HouseGuests and Shane becoming eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition. \n** If all the coaches declined the offer, the eviction would continue as planned, the game would not reset (with the coaches retaining coach status) and the previously evicted HouseGuests would be given the opportunity to re-enter the House. \nFollowing the coaches' decision, the game was reset. \n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the Head of Household competition, Big Brother tempted the HouseGuests with the option to either win $10,000 or receive immunity from being nominated for eviction that week. Britney was the first to complete the necessary number of laps to fill her immunity jug during the competition and earned safety, while Mike won $10,000 during the competition.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During Week 7 there were two Golden Powers of Veto. The first Veto was won by Ian as a result of Pandora's Box. Then, Jenn won the regular veto in the Veto competition. At the Veto Ceremony, Ian made his decision first as he won his veto earlier than Jenn - Ian opted not to use his veto, while Jenn chose to veto Dan's nomination.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: During the finale, the ''Jury of Seven'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=November 2019|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n{{POV-section|date=November 2019}}\n}}\nWillie was expelled from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone that he would do anything to get himself removed before the actual live eviction that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.\n\nOn Day 42, shortly after Shane made his nominations as Head of Household, he told Danielle that the production crew in the diary room explicitly told him not to put up Frank and Mike for nomination that week. However, both were nominated and were thus eligible for eviction that week. On Day 43, Frank drew a \"HouseGuest's Choice\" token during the player draw and when asked to draw again, as later confided to Boogie, he palmed the token. Many fans believe that this was a result of the production team's desire to keep Frank in the game. This led to an outrage within message boards, fans and viewers, causing many to doubt the authenticity of the show once more. The scandal also ran throughout the Big Brother House and caused tension between opposing HouseGuests, who were not allowed to discuss the situation. Allison Grodner did not comment on the scandal. A video of Frank talking to Boogie about the cheating was put on YouTube, but later removed by CBS for copyright purposes. Despite outcry from fans, the game continued on as normal. On Day 48, Mike was evicted from the game. Frank, when on the block, won the veto and later won HoH causing many forums to speculate that the competitions were rigged in Frank's favor. Despite controversy, the game progressed on regardless.\n\nOn Day 49, after winning the Golden Ball of Veto from the crane game, Ian alleged several times to various HouseGuests that some of the producers were attempting to manipulate his decision and threaten him in the Diary Room by supposedly telling Ian how the Ball of Veto will benefit him if he decided to use it. Although that did cause fans to question the Big Brother game, other HouseGuests from past seasons have stated that the producers always ask the HouseGuests to name pros and cons about evicting certain HouseGuests for the week and they also ask the HouseGuests how it will better their own personal game if they kept one HouseGuest in rather than the other and vice versa, it's been known (since Big Brother 2) that producers ask HouseGuests how evicting HouseGuests, using the PoV or a special power will benefit their game, but the outcome is not controlled by the producers as HouseGuests can quickly change their minds at the last second if needed to. From seasons 2 through 10 host Julie Chen during the live shows would then say, \"Let's take a look in the Diary Room where HouseGuests share their thoughts on the nominees as they cast their votes.\" and that's when the HouseGuests would share the pros and cons and explain what would and wouldn't benefit their own game.\n\n== Television ratings ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|+Key\n| {{dagger}}\n|Season high for that night of the week\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! class=\"sortable\" | Households<br />(rating/share)\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for breaking rules, such as exhibiting violent and disruptive behavior.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, [[Ian Terry]] won the season by a 6\u20131 vote over runner-up [[Dan Gheesling]].<ref>Patrick Gomez,[http://people.com/tv/big-brother-14-winner-revealed/], ''People Magazine''>, September 20, 2012.

If the Veto winner exercised the power, the Head of Household then nominated another HouseGuest for eviction.\n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the two nominees vote to evict one of the two nominees.<ref name=\"Guardian BBUK-UK\">{{Cite news |last=Pickard |first=Ann |title=Why is Big Brother so big in the US? |work=Guardian.co.uk |date=August 19, 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2009/aug/19/why-big-brother-big-us |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |location=London}}</ref> This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host Julie Chen.

It was also the first to have two vetos at one veto ceremony.\n\nIn a change from past seasons, four former HouseGuests from past seasons of ''Big Brother'' returned to coach the new HouseGuests during their time in the House. Each coach had to pick three of the new HouseGuests that they will guide throughout the entire game. When a HouseGuests wins Head of Household the coach of that Housemate will also gain their own private room adjacent to the Head of Household bedroom. The coaches compete in a new competition that replaces Have vs. Have-Not competition for the season. The winning coach is granted the power to give one of their players immunity for the week or to trade one of their players for a player from another team. Depending on the rules of the coach's competition, each coach then has to choose one of their own players to become a \"Have Not\" for the week or the winning coach has the opportunity of choosing all of the \"Have Nots\". HouseGuests that are chosen to be \"Have Nots\" for the week had to eat \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food restriction (chosen by the viewing public), take cold showers, and sleep on hard beds. The coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize and the $50,000 runner-up prize but instead were to be awarded a separate $100,000 prize if one of their chosen HouseGuests wins Big Brother. However, on Week 3, America voted to allow the coaches to vote whether to keep coaching or become HouseGuests. Three of four voted to reset the game, and all coaches earned HouseGuest status, now eligible to win the $500,000 grand prize.\n\n==HouseGuests==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n\nA total of sixteen HouseGuests entered the house, the same number of HouseGuests competing in ''[[Big Brother 9 (American season)|Big Brother 9]]''. On July 4, 2012, four television advertisements were released throughout the day, revealing eleven names of the HouseGuests.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Big Brother 14 Cast First Look!

However, unlike previous seasons where the returning players competed as regular HouseGuests, the veterans were tasked with coaching three of the new players. Upon entering the house, the coaches were ineligible to win the $500,000 grand prize, and were instead competing to win a separate prize of $100,000, which would be awarded to the coach of the winning HouseGuest. However, after the July 26 live eviction episode, viewers were allowed to vote on whether or not to give the coaches the option of entering the game as regular players for the $500,000 prize. On August 2, America's Vote was revealed. The result was to offer the coaches the option of entering the game. Julie Chen revealed that each coach would be called into the Diary Room individually to cast their vote to keep coaching or not. Inside the diary room was a reset button, signifying the game's reset for the coaches. If at least one coach decides to reset, all coaches would earn HouseGuest status. A 3\u20131 vote brought the coaches into the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; \n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Age on entry\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Occupation\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Residence\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Big Brother'' History\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Big Brother 14'' results\n|-\n!

He finished in 12th place. Jodi Rollins made a brief Cameo on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 1 (U.S. season)|first season]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Britney Haynes returned for ''[[Big Brother 20 (U.S. season)|Big Brother 20]]'' where she celebrated the engagement of two-time ''Big Brother'' houseguest Nicole Franzel and season 18 houseguest Victor Arroyo. Haynes and [[Janelle Pierzina]] competed as a team in ''[[The Amazing Race 31]]''.\n\n==Summary==\nOn the first night, twelve new HouseGuests entered the Big Brother House to two new twists of the season. The first twist was that four successful ex-HouseGuests would re-enter the House not to compete against one another, but to coach the new HouseGuests. Their job is to guide the HouseGuests for as long as they can, hoping to keep coaching a possible winner. The winner's coach would win a special $100,000 prize at the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, [[Dan Gheesling]] from ''[[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|Big Brother 10]]'', Britney Haynes from ''[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|Big Brother 12]]'', Mike \"Boogie\" Malin from ''[[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|Big Brother 2]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'', and [[Janelle Pierzina]] from ''[[Big Brother 6 (U.S.)|Big Brother 6]]'' and ''[[Big Brother: All-Stars|Big Brother: All Stars]]'' entered the House. On the second twist of the night, HouseGuests were informed that their status in the game were at risk. Because Big Brother sent the HouseGuests \"invitations\" to enter the House instead of a key, the HouseGuests had to earn their status in the first Head of Household competition as there were only eleven keys to be earned. Therefore, for the first time in ''Big Brother'' history, one HouseGuest would be evicted by the end of the first night. That night, Janelle and Britney forged an alliance after Dan and Boogie agreed to working together.\n\nBefore the HouseGuests competed in their first Head of Household competition, the coaches assigned their teammates. The coaches chose one by one and in order, Britney chose Shane, Willie, and JoJo; Mike chose Frank, Ian, and Jenn; Janelle chose Wil, Ashley, and Joe; and Dan chose Kara, Danielle, and Jodi. The HouseGuests other than the coaches competed in the first Head of Household competition. Each teammate had to jump across large moving mattresses to retrieve life-sized teddy bears (Upon the competition's completion, one of the HouseGuests, Frank, kept his teddy bear; calling him \"Teddy B\"). After twenty minutes, teams were allowed to substitute one teammate. Team Britney won the Head of Household competition, and Team Dan came in last place, giving Dan the responsibility to evict one of his players. On Day 1, Dan cast the sole vote to evict Jodi. Mike won the first coaches competition of the season called \"Big Brother Derby\" and won the power to grant one of his teammates immunity for the week: He chose Ian. The four coaches each had to choose one of their teammates to be a Have-Not for the week, with Ashley, Ian, Shane, and Danielle getting picked. Frank and Kara were nominated for eviction on Day 5. On Day 7, Shane won the Power of Veto competition, \"Loose Change\", which involved HouseGuests running around and trying to find coin props (one dollar coin, quarter and five cent coins). Once they find them they had to throw the coin props from a distance to a machine. Once they threw a total of $1.30 in coin props, they would win the Power of Veto. Shane decided to leave Willie's nominations the same. On Day 13, Kara was evicted in a 5 to 3 vote, leaving Danielle as Dan's only team member left. It was also revealed the winner of the next Coaches Competition would have the option of either saving one of his or her players or trading them with another player.\n\nFollowing Kara's eviction, Frank won the Head of Household competition, \"Big Brother Break-In\".  The HouseGuests had to determine whether a burglar that entered the house was guilty or not guilty of a certain crime. HouseGuests were eliminated by answering incorrectly. Janelle won the second coaches competition, \"Phat Stacks\", and chose to give Ashley immunity from the nominations. She also single-handedly chose the four Have-Nots for the week: Willie, Shane, JoJo, and Ian. On Day 14, Willie was [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|expelled]] from the house, after going on a rampage in which he threw pork rinds at Janelle, swore at the female HouseGuests, and headbutted Joe. Minutes later, JoJo and Shane were nominated for eviction. On Day 15, Shane won the ''Memory Chip'' Power of Veto competition, in which HouseGuests had to run around dressed as [[Tortilla chip|salsa chips]] and dive into different pools of salsa and find different menu items names and then they had to bring the names and put them in correct order in their menu as it is on a menu at which they could look at. The HouseGuest that got most of the names in the correct order in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. Shane removed himself from the block, and Frank then nominated Danielle for eviction. When JoJo and Shane were flirting in the have-not room one night, Ian told Danielle about this and thus, Danielle told Janelle's and Boogie's players. On Day 20, JoJo was evicted by a vote of 5 to 1, only receiving the vote of Shane.\n\nFollowing JoJo's eviction, Shane won the \"On Thin Ice\" HoH competition. The HouseGuests shot balls into a slotted end of an ice rink that had scores for each slot. Host [[Julie Chen]] then revealed to the viewers they could vote on whether or not the mentors should be allowed to enter the game. On Day 21, the HouseGuests went to the Big Brother Gym for their coaches competition \"Feel the Burn\". Their goal was to do as many exercises of a certain type. The coach who would do the least would be eliminated. When they were eliminated they had the chance to open a locker and possibly win something. Britney chose Ian and Joe as Have-Nots, Mike Boogie won $10,000 that he shared with Ian whom he gave $3,000 and Jenn who received $1,000. Dan had the opportunity to invite five people to a private sushi & cocktail party. He chose Boogie, Britney, Janelle, Shane & Danielle. Janelle won the Coaches Competition and saved Wil. Later that day, Shane nominated Ashley and Joe for eviction. Also on Day 21; Shane, Ashley, Joe, Wil, Danielle, and Frank had been chosen to compete in the Veto Competition. On Day 22, all had competed in ''The Juggler'' Veto Competition, where each HouseGuest had to roll back and forth two balls at the same time on two different ramps. If even one of the balls would fall, that person would be out. Shane won the Power of Veto for the third week in a row. On Day 24, Shane used the Power of Veto on Ashley, nominating Frank in her place. Before the live eviction took place on Day 27, Julie Chen announced that America has chosen to give the coaches the opportunity to play the game and stop coaching. If the coaches voted to become players, the eviction would be canceled and everyone would play in the HoH, including Shane. However, if the coaches chose to keep the game the same, the eviction would continue, but one evicted HouseGuest would return the following week. Julie Chen also announced that only one vote was required to reset the entire game. One by one, the coaches were called into the Diary Room whether to hit the \"Reset Button\" or not. Britney, Dan and Janelle chose to hit the button, while Mike Boogie did not. With the vote of 3\u20131, the coaches were reverted to HouseGuest status and Joe and Frank were spared eviction.\n\nAll hounded HouseGuests then began to participate in the \"[[Walking the plank|Walk the Plank]]\" HoH endurance competition, in which the HouseGuests had to hold on to a bar. If they fell from the plank, they would be eliminated. After a nearly four-hour battle, Danielle became the new HoH, outlasting Britney and Ian. On Day 28, Danielle nominated Frank and Wil for eviction. Danielle won the Power of Veto from the \"Field of Veto\" competition on Day 29. Later, Boogie made a huge pitch to Danielle by using the veto and backdoor his long-time rival Janelle. A few hours later, all 4 coaches came up to the HOH room and Boogie called out Janelle on her lies. So Dan made an offer to her, if Frank gets vetoed, then Joe goes up. But when Janelle refused to answer, Dan knew that the possibility of all 4 coaches working together has blown up and he has no choice but to accept Boogie's offer on backdooring Janelle. On Day 30, Britney, Dan, Danielle, Frank, Mike Boogie and Shane created the \"Silent Six\" alliance and conspired to backdoor Janelle. On Day 31, Danielle went through with the plan and used the Power of Veto on Wil and put up Janelle as a replacement nominee. On Day 34, Janelle was evicted by an 8 to 1 vote with Joe as her only vote and became the first returning HouseGuest to leave the show and also marking the first time Janelle has not reached the final three.\n\nFollowing Janelle's eviction, on Day 34, all HouseGuests, with the exception of Danielle as the outgoing HoH, competed in the \"[[Battle of the Bands|Big Brother Battle of the Bands]]\" HoH competition, in which Frank became the new Head of Household for the second time this season. On Day 35, all HouseGuests competed in the Have/Have Not competition ''E-Squeeze Me?'', except for Ashley who was having back spasms and could not compete. Frank played in her spot. Britney, Danielle, Joe and Shane became the Have Nots for the week, making this week the first week Ian is a Have. On Day 35, Frank nominated Joe and Wil for eviction. The next night, the HouseGuests competed in the Power of Veto competition, ''Birth of Zingbot'', which Frank won. Before the Veto meeting, Wil and Ashley came to Frank and made a pitch on backdooring Dan. But when Boogie heard about this from Frank, he said to Frank, \"If you put up Dan, then it's 8 versus 2 and it's game over for us.\" So at the veto meeting, Frank then decided to keep his nominations the same. On Day 41, Wil was evicted by a 6 to 2 vote.\n\nFollowing Wil's eviction, on Day 41, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Swamped\" Head of Household Competition. The first HouseGuest to fill up the HoH jug with liquid and release the cork would win. There were two other jugs as well. One was safety and the other was a choice between $10,000 or a Have Not Pass decided by the viewers voting for $10,000. Britney won safety, Mike Boogie won $10,000, and Shane won his second HoH competition and became the new Head of Household. After the HOH competition, Boogie told Ian his targets would be Britney and Shane for the future. But Ian went on to warn them about Boogie and Frank and they cannot be trusted anymore. On Day 42, Shane went against his \"Silent Six\" alliance in favor of his second alliance (The Quack Pack) by nominating Frank and Mike Boogie for eviction. After the nomination ceremony, Boogie and Frank were lashing at Dan believing he was the mastermind behind their nominations. But unbeknownst to them, their ally Ian was the \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" Frank then won his second straight Power of Veto in the [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)#Controversy|controversial]] Veto competition, ''The Candy Counter''. Frank then used the Veto to save himself from nominations and Shane chose to nominate Jenn as the replacement. On Day 48, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was a Double Eviction night. For the first of the two evictions, Mike Boogie was evicted by a vote of 5\u20132. During the double eviction, Ian won the \"Before or After\" HoH and immediately nominated Ashley and Frank for eviction. Frank then won his third straight Power of Veto of the season in \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over The Veto]]\" and took himself off the block. Ian named Joe as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second eviction, Ashley was evicted by a vote of 5\u20131 and became the first member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Boogie and Ashley's eviction, Frank became the new Head of Household and got to choose one HouseGuest to become the Have Not for the week. Frank decided to choose Dan. On Day 49, Frank was given an option to open Pandora's Box. Frank decided to open Pandora's Box and received a little over $3,000, but unleashed quarters in the backyard to play the skill crane game, containing a Golden Ball of Veto. Ian got the ball and won the veto, but in doing so he sacrificed his chance to play in the week's POV competition. Later that day, Frank chose to nominate Dan and Danielle for eviction. On Day 50, the HouseGuests (with the exception of host Ian, who had to sit out since he already had the Golden Ball of Veto, and Joe, who wasn't chosen) played in the Power of Veto competition [[Draw Something]], which was made after the app of the same name. Jenn won her first competition of the summer after Frank was disqualified from the competition for whispering an answer to Britney during her turn. On Day 51, in one of the greatest game moves in \"Big Brother\" history, Dan came up with a master plan to get himself off the block by hosting his own \"funeral\" after having 24 hours of solitary confinement to think on how he was going to get out of this mess. First, he gathered everyone in the living room and paid compliments to his fellow HouseGuests. He thanked Joe for teaching him how to be a good husband, called Shane the \"real\" Captain America, and told Jenn that she was the first lesbian he'd ever met and that he appreciated how much she has touched his heart. He bonded with Britney over their status as newlyweds praised Ian for making the experience of being in the Big Brother house more fun. To Frank, Dan said that he wanted to apologize one-on-one after the funeral about some things he had said. However, for Danielle, he said that he thought that she had similar qualities to Dan's closest friend and ally Memphis Garrett from Big Brother 10, but he found out that he was wrong. He said to her that \"You'll never earn my trust back, you know what you did, and in this game you are dead to me.\" Later, he managed to strike a final two deal with Frank, his nemesis in the house and exposed the Quack Pack to him, telling that Ian was responsible for Boogie's eviction, not Dan. They manage to strike a final two deal and proposed a new alliance with Jenn and Danielle. Following this, he did some damage control to Danielle about the \"funeral\" and said that it was all an act and he used her emotions just to get them further in the game. Then, he said that he wanted to work with Frank and Jenn along with her. Thus, the two then went to Jenn in hopes of her using the veto to remove Dan from the block. On Day 52, Ian decided not to use his veto, while Jenn went through with the plan and Britney was shockingly put up as the replacement nominee, completely blindsiding Ian and Britney. Later, Ian and Frank had a huge fight over him betraying Mike \"Boogie\" and also putting Frank up on the block with Ashley in exchange for Frank giving Ian $3,000 during the Coaches' Competition in week 3. On Day 55, Britney was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, only receiving the vote of Ian and became the second member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Britney's eviction on Day 55, the HouseGuests competed in an endurance HoH competition called \"[[Soak Up the Sun]]\". In the competition, players had to hold onto a rope as it moved around a sun on the ground. With 51% of the public Twitter poll cast during the live show, America voted the first HouseGuest to drop out to have a punishment over a reward. Joe, for being the first to drop, was given a [[hula hoop]] and was required to use it every time Big Brother sounded [[Reveille]]. It was revealed that 5 hours before the previous live show began, Ian tells Dan he wants to reunite the Quack Pack and to tell him that he's not mad at Dan for what he did this week, but his main concern is that Dan will try to work with Frank and Jenn along with Danielle. So after Ian talked to Dan, Dan told Shane about Ian's idea of reuniting the Quack Pack and he wants go all the way to final four with him, Ian and Danielle. Ian outlasted all the HouseGuests and won HoH less than two hours later. On Day 56, Pandora's Box was presented again and Ian opted to open it, releasing small presents (along with a new hammock for the backyard). Ian also received $1,000 in prize money. However, ''Big Brother 10'' and ''11''{{'}}s Jessie Godderz was also released into the house, replacing all of their junk food and snacks with healthy, organic food for the week. On Day 56, Ian nominated Frank and Jenn for eviction. On Day 57, Dan won the Power of Veto competition which featured the return of OTEV. On Day 59, Dan decided to return the favor to Jenn (who vetoed him last week) and used the Veto on her. Ian nominated Joe in her place. On Day 62, it was revealed to the HouseGuests that it was another double eviction night. For the first of two evictions, Frank was evicted by a vote of 3\u20131 and became the third member of the jury, with Jenn being the only voter to evict Joe. Immediately afterwards, Dan won the \"Make Your Case\" Head of Household competition after a tiebreaker question with Jenn and Danielle. A few minutes later, Dan nominated both Ian and Joe for eviction with Ian as Dan's main target. Ian then won the \"[[Swimming with Sharks]]\" Power of Veto competition and removed himself from the block. Dan named Danielle as the replacement nominee. At the end of the second double eviction, Joe was evicted by a vote of 3\u20130 and became the fourth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Frank and Joe's eviction, Ian won the \"Memory Lane\" Head of Household competition, making this his third HoH win and tying him with Frank for the most HoH wins so far this season. On Day 63, Ian opened Pandora's Box thereby giving the other HouseGuests video messages from home while he talked to [[Rachel Reilly]] from ''Big Brother 12'' and ''13''. Later that day, Ian nominated Jenn and Shane for eviction. On Day 64, Shane won the Power of Veto and a prize. On Day 65, Shane and Danielle went on a luxury prize to the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastic Champions. On Day 66, Shane decided to use the Power of Veto to save himself from the block, and in return, Ian nominated Danielle as the replacement. On Day 68, Jenn was evicted by a vote of 2\u20130 and became the fifth member of the jury. On Day 68, Danielle won her second HoH competition of the season \"Photographic Memory\", and went on to nominate Dan and Ian for eviction. On Day 68, Danielle won the \"Atomic Veto\" competition, making it her second and final Veto of the season. After the veto competition, Dan asked Danielle to use the Veto on himself, to which Danielle would only agree if Dan would evict Ian and not Shane. On Day 69, Danielle used the Power of Veto on Dan, and was replaced by Shane. A few minutes later, the biggest blindside of the summer occurred as Dan chose to evict Shane, blindsiding Danielle and Shane. Shane became the sixth member of the jury.\n\nFollowing Shane's eviction, Dan won the first part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Hook, Line, and Sinker\" (similar to the \"King of The Jungle\" endurance HOH from season 10 in which Dan also won). On Day 71, Ian won the second part of the final Head of Household competition, \"Climb Time\". On Day 75, Ian won the third part of the final Head of Household, \"Jury Statements\" and became the final Head of Household of the season. Ian then evicted Danielle and chose Dan to take to the final two. The jury was allowed to ask questions to both Dan and Ian, who began to turn against each other. In the end, the jury voted for Ian to win the grand prize by a vote of 6 to 1 over Dan, with Danielle being the only person to vote for Dan. Before the finale ended, Julie Chen announced that Frank was the winner of the $25,000 America's Favorite HouseGuest prize.\nIan Terry now has a record of 4 HOH wins, tying Vanessa Rousso and Steve Moses both from Big Brother 17, Caleb Reynolds from Big Brother 16, Aaryn Gries from Big Brother 15, Rachel Reilly from Big Brother 13, Hayden Moss from Big Brother 12, Janelle Pierzina from Big Brother 7 and Drew Daniel from Big Brother 5.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

As the coach of the last-place team, Dan had to evict one member of his team on Day 1.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the first three weeks, the coaches participated in a competition that gave them the power to save or trade one of their players. In Week 2, the power of trading a player was introduced.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: Due to a violent outburst, Willie was expelled from the game by Big Brother on Day 14. Because Frank had not made nominations yet, Big Brother decided to allow the game to continue on as normal. In addition, Willie's expulsion prevented him from being a candidate for America's Favorite HouseGuest.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} Prior to the planned live eviction on Day 27, America voted to offer the coaches the opportunity to become HouseGuests and entering the main game. The coaches individually entered the Diary Room and were presented with a reset button. Pressing the button was acceptance of America's offer. If a coach did not press the button that meant declining the offer. \n** Had the button been pressed by at least one coach, the planned eviction would be cancelled and the game would reset - with the coaches becoming full HouseGuests and Shane becoming eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition. \n** If all the coaches declined the offer, the eviction would continue as planned, the game would not reset (with the coaches retaining coach status) and the previously evicted HouseGuests would be given the opportunity to re-enter the House. \nFollowing the coaches' decision, the game was reset. \n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} During the Head of Household competition, Big Brother tempted the HouseGuests with the option to either win $10,000 or receive immunity from being nominated for eviction that week. Britney was the first to complete the necessary number of laps to fill her immunity jug during the competition and earned safety, while Mike won $10,000 during the competition.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During Week 7 there were two Golden Powers of Veto. The first Veto was won by Ian as a result of Pandora's Box. Then, Jenn won the regular veto in the Veto competition. At the Veto Ceremony, Ian made his decision first as he won his veto earlier than Jenn - Ian opted not to use his veto, while Jenn chose to veto Dan's nomination.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: During the finale, the ''Jury of Seven'' voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=November 2019|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\n{{POV-section|date=November 2019}}\n}}\nWillie was expelled from the Big Brother house on Day 14 after head butting Joe, who had made comments in retaliation to comments made by Willie. Moments before the incident with Joe, Willie told everyone that he would do anything to get himself removed before the actual live eviction that week. Willie proceeded to throw food at Janelle and call other female HouseGuests explicit names, before ending his rampage with the headbutt incident. He was immediately called into the Diary Room and expelled from the game. Minutes later the remaining HouseGuests were informed by producer Allison Grodner that Willie had been permanently removed from the game and the game would continue as normal.\n\nOn Day 42, shortly after Shane made his nominations as Head of Household, he told Danielle that the production crew in the diary room explicitly told him not to put up Frank and Mike for nomination that week. However, both were nominated and were thus eligible for eviction that week. On Day 43, Frank drew a \"HouseGuest's Choice\" token during the player draw and when asked to draw again, as later confided to Boogie, he palmed the token. Many fans believe that this was a result of the production team's desire to keep Frank in the game. This led to an outrage within message boards, fans and viewers, causing many to doubt the authenticity of the show once more. The scandal also ran throughout the Big Brother House and caused tension between opposing HouseGuests, who were not allowed to discuss the situation. Allison Grodner did not comment on the scandal. A video of Frank talking to Boogie about the cheating was put on YouTube, but later removed by CBS for copyright purposes. Despite outcry from fans, the game continued on as normal. On Day 48, Mike was evicted from the game. Frank, when on the block, won the veto and later won HoH causing many forums to speculate that the competitions were rigged in Frank's favor. Despite controversy, the game progressed on regardless.\n\nOn Day 49, after winning the Golden Ball of Veto from the crane game, Ian alleged several times to various HouseGuests that some of the producers were attempting to manipulate his decision and threaten him in the Diary Room by supposedly telling Ian how the Ball of Veto will benefit him if he decided to use it. Although that did cause fans to question the Big Brother game, other HouseGuests from past seasons have stated that the producers always ask the HouseGuests to name pros and cons about evicting certain HouseGuests for the week and they also ask the HouseGuests how it will better their own personal game if they kept one HouseGuest in rather than the other and vice versa, it's been known (since Big Brother 2) that producers ask HouseGuests how evicting HouseGuests, using the PoV or a special power will benefit their game, but the outcome is not controlled by the producers as HouseGuests can quickly change their minds at the last second if needed to. From seasons 2 through 10 host Julie Chen during the live shows would then say, \"Let's take a look in the Diary Room where HouseGuests share their thoughts on the nominees as they cast their votes.\" and that's when the HouseGuests would share the pros and cons and explain what would and wouldn't benefit their own game.\n\n== Television ratings ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|+Key\n| {{dagger}}\n|Season high for that night of the week\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! class=\"sortable\" | Households<br />(rating/share)\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The Taif agreement enshrines a sect-based political system, where political authority is allocated based on the religious affiliation of the public servant.

Storey & Co in England and now by [[Hasbro]], ''Sorry!'' is marketed for two to four players, ages 6 and up. The game title comes from the many ways in which a player can negate the progress of another, while issuing an apologetic \"Sorry!\"\n\n==Objective==\nThe objective is to be the first player to get all four of their coloured pawns from their start space, around the board to their \"home\" space. The pawns are normally moved in a clockwise direction but can be moved backward if directed. Movement of pawns is directed by the drawing of a card.\n\nThe board game is laid out in a square with 16 spaces per side, with each player assigned their own coloured Start location and Home locations offset towards the centre, one per side. Four five-square paths, one per colour, lead from the common outer path towards a player's Home and are designated their \"Safety Zone\". On each side are two \"Slides\", grouping four or five spaces each.\n\nOlder versions of ''Sorry!'' contain a coloured \"diamond space\" directly one space back from each start square; a pawn of the diamond's colour may not move forward over this square. Instead, a pawn of that colour must diverge from the outer space square towards their \"Home\". The diamond space and corresponding rule were removed from subsequent editions.\n\n==History==\nWilliam Henry Story of [[Southend-on-Sea]] filed for a patent for the game in England, where it was registered as a [[trade mark]] on 21 May 1929 (UK number 502898). It was subsequently sold in the United Kingdom by [[Waddingtons]], the British games manufacturer who sold it from 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&trademark=502898|title=Search for a trade mark - Intellectual Property Office|website=www.ipo.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photosurrealism.com/games/sorry/history.html|title=History}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, {{US patent|1903661}} was filed for ''Sorry!'' on 4 Aug 1930 by William Henry Storey. A Canadian patent followed in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/324486/summary.html|title=Canadian Patent Database / Base de donn\u00e9es sur les brevets canadiens|first=Government of Canada, Industry Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Canadian Intellectual Property|last=Office|website=brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca}}</ref> The US patent was issued on 11 April 1933. ''Sorry!'' was adopted by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1934. Hasbro now continuously publishes it.\n\n==Classic rules==\nEach player chooses four pawns of one color and places them in their Start. One player is selected to play first.\n\nEach player, in turn, draws one card from the deck and follows its instructions. To begin the game, all of a player's four pawns are restricted to Start; a player can only move them out onto the rest of the board if he or she draws a 1 or 2 card. A 1 or a 2 places a pawn on the space directly outside of start (a 2 does not entitle the pawn to move a second space).\n\nA pawn can jump over any other pawn during its move. However, two pawns cannot occupy the same square; a pawn that lands on a square occupied by another player's pawn \"bumps\" that pawn back to its own Start. Players can not bump their own pawns back to Start; if the only way to complete a move would result in a player bumping their own pawn, the player's pawns remain in place and the player loses their turn.\n\nIf a pawn lands at the start of a slide (except those of its own color), either by direct movement or as the result of a switch from an 11 card or a Sorry card, it immediately \"slides\" to the last square of the slide. All pawns on all spaces of the slide (including those belonging to the sliding player) are sent back to their respective Starts.<ref name=\"Hasbro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/sorry.pdf|title=Scan of Sorry! rules at hasbro.com}}</ref>\n\nThe last five squares before each player's Home are \"Safety Zones\", and are specially colored corresponding to the colors of the Homes they lead to. Access is limited to pawns of the same color. Pawns inside the Safety Zones are immune to being bumped by opponents' pawns or being switched with opponents' pawns via 11 or Sorry! cards. However, if a pawn is forced via a 10 or 4 card to move backward out of the Safety Zone, it is no longer considered \"dangerous\" and may be bumped by or switched with opponents' pawns as usual until it re-enters the Safety Zone.\n\n===2013 Edition rule changes===\n\nIn the 2013 Edition, several rules were changed.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Each player only has three pawns. A pawn can be moved out from Start upon any positive number card. A Sorry! card gives the alternative option of moving forward 4 spaces. The 2 card no longer allows one to pull another card, and the Sorry card cannot be used from the Start space.\n\nFurthermore, two additional items known as Fire and Ice were added, and depending on which card is drawn, can be placed on certain pawns on the board, modifying the playing rules for those pawns.  In short, fire gives a pawn the ability to move ahead quickly before the player's turn, and ice stops a pawn from being moved (or removed from play) at all.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe main rule changes were reverted in a later edition, but the Fire and Ice cards remained.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Classic cards and function==\nThe modern deck contains 45 cards: there are five 1 cards as well as four each of the other cards (''Sorry!'', 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12). The 6s or 9s are omitted to avoid confusion with each other. The first edition of the game had 44 cards (four of each) and the extra 1 card was soon introduced as an option for quicker play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Sorry_1939.pdf|title=Sorry 1939 Instructions}}</ref> A 1996 board from Waddingtons had 5 of each card.\n\nCards are annotated with the following actions:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!1\n|Either move a pawn from Start or move a pawn one space forward. (In the 2013 edition, the player may also \"move ice\" before doing so.)\n|-\n!2\n|Either move a pawn from Start or move a pawn two spaces forward. Drawing a two entitles the player to draw again at the end of their turn. If the player cannot use a two to move, he or she can still draw again. (In the 2013 edition, the player may also \"move fire\" as part of this card's effect.)\n|-\n!3\n|Move a pawn three spaces forward.\n|-\n!4\n|Move a pawn four spaces backward.\n|-\n!5\n|Move a pawn five spaces forward.\n|-\n!7\n|Move one pawn seven spaces forward, or split the seven spaces between two pawns (such as four spaces for one pawn and three for another). This makes it possible for two pawns to enter Home on the same turn, for example. The seven cannot be used to move a pawn out of Start, even if the player splits it into a six and one or a five and two. The entire seven spaces must be used or the turn is lost. You may not move backwards with a split.\n|-\n!8\n|Move a pawn eight spaces forward.\n|-\n!10\n|Move a pawn ten spaces forward or one space backward. If none of a player's pawns can move forward 10 spaces, then one pawn must move back one space.\n|-\n!11\n|Move eleven spaces forward, or switch the places of one of the player's own pawns and an opponent's pawn. A player who cannot move 11 spaces is not forced to switch and instead can forfeit the turn. An 11 cannot be used to switch a pawn that is in a Safety Zone.\n|-\n!12\n|Move a pawn twelve spaces forward.\n|-\n!style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|Sorry! card\n|Take any one pawn from Start and move it directly to a square occupied by any opponent's pawn, sending that pawn back to its own Start. A Sorry! card cannot be used on an opponent's pawn in a Safety Zone. If there are no pawns on the player's Start, or no opponent's pawns on any space you can move to, the turn is forfeited.<ref name=\"Hasbro\" />\n|}\n\n==Strategy==\nPlayers who have a pawn that has not moved too far away from its starting piece, and draw a card that allows them to move a pawn backward, can (and should) elect to move this pawn backward. Move a pawn in such a situation backward enough, and the pawn is suddenly almost home.\n\nThe 7 can be split; it is often possible to do so such that one of the pieces ends up on a slide, thus increasing the value of this card. It also provides an additional opportunity for pawns to get Home, so long as there's another pawn on the board to use up the remaining spaces.\n\nAll other things being equal, moves that cause a pawn to end up in front of an opponent's start square are poor choices, due to the high number of cards that allow that opponent to enter. Some feel that leaving a pawn on one's own square just outside \"Start\" (also known as the \"Dot\") is a poor position to be in since new pawns are blocked from entering play.\n\nThere are numerous strategies and tactics employed by skilled players. One such strategy is to leave the last pawn in the \"Start\" square and move the other pawns around the board while waiting for a \"Sorry\" card.\n\nDue to the 11 (switching places), 4 (moving backwards, as noted above), and \"Sorry\" (allowing the player to send virtually any pawn back to its start) cards, the lead in the game can change dramatically in a short amount of time; players are very rarely so far behind as to be completely out of the game. This should be considered when playing a \"Sorry\" or an 11.\n\nSlowing the game down is a risky yet effective move when given the opportunity. Essentially, when a player has the chance to switch with or hit the apparent leader, even though the move will not be to the player's immediate advancement around the board, the move should be made to keep the leader out of \"Safety\" and more importantly, out of \"Home\".\n\n==Official variants==\n===Point-Scoring Sorry!===\nThe 1939 edition of the game includes \"Point-Scoring Sorry!\", a variant where the game is scored at the end.<ref name=\"parker39\"/> The game also gives players a hand of cards, each player being dealt five at the start of the game. On a player's turn, they play one card from their hand to determine their move, and then draw a replacement card from the remaining deck. If a player cannot play any of their cards, they may discard a card and draw a replacement.\n\nAt the end of the game, each player scores a point for every man they got home. The winner also scores one point for every man their opponents had got home, and a bonus of either 24 (if no opponent has a man home), 16 (if no opponent has more than one man home) or 8 (if no opponent has more than two men home).<ref name=\"parker39\"/>\n\n===Teams===\nPlayers can elect to play the game in two teams of two.<ref name=\"parker39\">{{cite web |title=Rules for Playing the Great Game Sorry! (1939) |url=https://winning-moves.com/images/sorryrulesbooklet.pdf |publisher=Parker Brothers |accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref> The team pairings are always colours on opposite sides of the board (i.e. Red and Yellow vs. Blue and Green). The game is then played as if two players had eight pawns each: for example, the yellow player may move a red pawn for any legal move. A 7 card could be split between a yellow pawn and a red one but can still be split between no more than two pieces. However, a partner's pawns are not \"bump-proof\": if yellow were to draw a Sorry! card with only red pawns on the board, or land on a red pawn's occupied space, yellow would have to bump its teammate.\n\nOnce one of the partners has played all of their pieces into home, he continues to draw and play cards on their turn, if possible, for their partner. The first partnership to play all eight pieces in its home wins.<ref name=\"parker39\"/>\n\n==Video games==\nA electronic gaming version of ''[[Sorry! (video game)|Sorry!]]'' was released in 1998 as a ''Sorry!'' computer game. Also, a handheld version was released in 1996.\n\nIn the ''Hoyle Table Games'' collection of computer games, the game ''Bump 'Em'' is similar to ''Sorry!''. Pawns are represented as [[bumper cars]], and the board follows a path akin to a [[freeway]] [[Cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] instead of a regular square. There are no partnerships allowed.\n\n==Sorry! Express==\nParker Brothers has released a travel version of Sorry! called Sorry! Express. The game consists of three dice, four home bases, a start base, and sixteen pawns, four in each colour. Up to four players can play this game. To play, each player takes a home base and sets it on a different colour and all of the pawns are put on the start base no matter how many people are playing. The first person rolls all three dice and gets one of four possibilities for each die:\n\n# Colour pawn \u2013 The player takes the corresponding colour pawn from the start base and, if it matches up with the colour of their home base, puts it in their home section. If not, it is put in their waiting area. When there are no more pawns of a particular colour in the Start base and a player rolls that same colour, he can take that colour pawn from another player's waiting area, ''not'' their Home section.\n# Sorry! \u2013 Take a pawn from the home section of one player's home base and keep it.\n# Wild Pawn \u2013  The player may take any colour pawn from the Start base or waiting areas (not the Home section of another player) and keep it.\n# Slide \u2013 Change either one's own Home section or someone else's Home section to a different colour.\n\nThe first person to get four pawns of the same colour in their home section wins.\n\n== Sorry! Not Sorry! ==\nSorry! Not Sorry! is an adult-themed edition of Sorry! which consisted of the classic game, but added several cards each containing a [[Never Have I Ever|\"Have you ever...?\"]] question. Upon drawing, the player must ask an opponent the fill-in-the-blank question printed on the card.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/45305599|title=Sorry! Not Sorry!

(video game)|Sorry!]]'' was released in 1998 as a ''Sorry!'' computer game. Also, a handheld version was released in 1996.\n\nIn the ''Hoyle Table Games'' collection of computer games, the game ''Bump 'Em'' is similar to ''Sorry!''. Pawns are represented as [[bumper cars]], and the board follows a path akin to a [[freeway]] [[Cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] instead of a regular square. There are no partnerships allowed.\n\n==Sorry! Express==\nParker Brothers has released a travel version of Sorry! called Sorry! Express. The game consists of three dice, four home bases, a start base, and sixteen pawns, four in each colour. Up to four players can play this game. To play, each player takes a home base and sets it on a different colour and all of the pawns are put on the start base no matter how many people are playing. The first person rolls all three dice and gets one of four possibilities for each die:\n\n# Colour pawn \u2013 The player takes the corresponding colour pawn from the start base and, if it matches up with the colour of their home base, puts it in their home section. If not, it is put in their waiting area. When there are no more pawns of a particular colour in the Start base and a player rolls that same colour, he can take that colour pawn from another player's waiting area, ''not'' their Home section.\n# Sorry! \u2013 Take a pawn from the home section of one player's home base and keep it.\n# Wild Pawn \u2013  The player may take any colour pawn from the Start base or waiting areas (not the Home section of another player) and keep it.\n# Slide \u2013 Change either one's own Home section or someone else's Home section to a different colour.\n\nThe first person to get four pawns of the same colour in their home section wins.\n\n== Sorry! Not Sorry! ==\nSorry! Not Sorry! is an adult-themed edition of Sorry! which consisted of the classic game, but added several cards each containing a [[Never Have I Ever|\"Have you ever...?\"]] question. Upon drawing, the player must ask an opponent the fill-in-the-blank question printed on the card.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/45305599|title=Sorry! Not Sorry!

This season featured 16 HouseGuests.\n\nThe premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees, and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last nine evicted HouseGuests would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. \n\nThe September 5, 2013, broadcast marked the show's 500th

For this competition, HouseGuests were put into a tournament-style bracket. The object was to roll a ball down a curved banana and have it land on top of the ice cream sundae. The first HouseGuest to get the ball on the sundae, moved on to the next round. Andy was the winner. Andy was also tasked with picking four HouseGuests as Have-Nots for the week and chose Aaryn, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen. On Day 50, Jessie and Spencer were nominated for eviction. Elissa, Amanda, and Helen were picked to play in the veto competition, while McCrae was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"BBB Movie\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a few minutes to study three movie sets. They were then asked questions about how many of a certain item there were in a set. If the HouseGuest was confident in their answer, they would \"stay\" for an attempt at winning a movie ticket. The housemate that was closest to the correct answer would receive a movie ticket, while the others were eliminated. If they were not confident they would \"fold\" and stay in the competition regardless of their answer. The first HouseGuest to obtain three movie tickets would be the winner. Andy was the winner. On Day 53, Andy chose not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 56, in a unanimous vote of 6\u20130, Jessie was evicted and became the third jury member.\n\nFollowing Jessie's eviction, Aaryn won her fourth Head of Household of the season in the \"Way Off Broadway\" HoH competition. Later that day, Julie Chen revealed to the audience that one of the four jury members would be coming back on the next weeks eviction night. On Day 57, the HouseGuests competed in the Have-Not competition, \"The Black Box\". In this competition, the HouseGuests had to enter a big, pitch-black box with many crawl spaces and gags, find the key, and exit the black box and hit a button to stop the timer. Amanda, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen were the Have-Nots for the week. Aaryn then chose to nominate Elissa and Helen, with Helen being her target. Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer were selected to play in the Veto competition. On Day 58, Elissa went on to win her second Veto competition of the season. Elissa used the Veto to remove her nomination, and Aaryn nominated Spencer in her stead. On Day 63, Helen was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, with Elissa being the only one to vote for Spencer.\n\nShortly after Helen's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests and first four jurors competed in the \"Off the Wall\" competition, which functioned as both the HoH and re-entry competition. The HouseGuests and jurors were to stand on platforms and catch balls thrown at them without falling off. The first player overall to catch 10 balls or last to remain standing would be the new HoH, and the first juror to do so would return to the game. Judd was the last juror left standing and returned to the game as a HouseGuest, and Elissa was the first to catch 10 balls and became Head of Household. On Day 64, Elissa nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. On Day 65, Amanda, GinaMarie, and Judd were selected to play in the Veto competition. Amanda won the Veto competition, her first individual competition win of the season. On Day 67, Amanda used the Power of Veto to save McCrae, causing Elissa to name Andy the replacement nominee. On Day 70, Aaryn was evicted by a vote of 5\u20130.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\">{{cite magazine|title = 'Big Brother 15': Latest Houseguest Evicted, Audience Gets Vocal|date = August 29, 2013|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-brother-15-ninth-houseguest-617564|last = Ng|first = Philiana|magazine = The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Aaryn's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests began the \"Big Hopportunity\" competition. The HouseGuests were to hop to a wall made from chicken wire. There, each HouseGuest navigated their egg them through a maze formed by the letters \"HoH\" to a hole at the far side. They then had to hop back down and drop the egg in their basket. GinaMarie was the first HouseGuest with a dozen eggs and won the HoH. On the live show, Julie Chen also announced that the HouseGuests will compete in a special competition, and a live double eviction during Week 10.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\" /> On Day 71, GinaMarie chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae for eviction. On Day 72, Spencer, Andy, and Elissa were selected to play in the Veto competition. McCrae won the Veto competition. On Day 74, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer was once again named the replacement nominee. On Day 77, Amanda was evicted in a 3\u20132 vote after GinaMarie was forced to break the tie.  Because this was also a double eviction week, the remaining HouseGuests went straight into the Head of Household competition, which McCrae won. McCrae (unaware that Andy was the one who had double crossed him and Amanda) nominated Elissa and GinaMarie shortly after. When Judd won the Power of Veto, he decided not to use it and Elissa was evicted in a unanimous 3\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Amanda and Elissa's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the following Head of Household competition, which Spencer won. He nominated GinaMarie and McCrae. On Day 79, McCrae won the Power of Veto, his third Veto win of the season. On Day 81, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer chose to name Judd as the replacement nominee. On Day 82, Judd was evicted from the house for a second time in a 2\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Judd's second eviction, Andy won his second HoH of the season in the \"Before or After\" HoH competition. On Day 83, he nominated McCrae and Spencer for eviction. That same day, the HouseGuests competed in the final Veto competition of the season, titled \"Web of (F)Lies.\" Andy won the Power of Veto. On Day 84, Andy decided not to use the Power of Veto. Immediately following the Veto ceremony, GinaMarie, with the sole vote to evict, choose to evict McCrae from the game.\n\nFollowing McCrae's eviction, the final three participated in the first part of the final HoH competition, \"The Great E-skate,\" with GinaMarie being the victor. On Day 86, Spencer and Andy competed in part two of the final HoH competition, \"Crab Grab,\" which Andy won. During the finale, Andy and GinaMarie faced off in the final part of the competition, \"Jury Statements\". Andy won the competition and, as final HoH, cast the sole vote to evict Spencer from the house. After asking questions to the final two, the nine-person jury voted to crown the season's winner. Andy won in with a 7\u20132 vote, and Elissa won $25,000 as America's Favorite HouseGuest, with Judd and Howard gaining the next-highest number of votes.<ref name=\"THR_finale\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

For this competition, HouseGuests were put into a tournament-style bracket. The object was to roll a ball down a curved banana and have it land on top of the ice cream sundae. The first HouseGuest to get the ball on the sundae, moved on to the next round. Andy was the winner. Andy was also tasked with picking four HouseGuests as Have-Nots for the week and chose Aaryn, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen. On Day 50, Jessie and Spencer were nominated for eviction. Elissa, Amanda, and Helen were picked to play in the veto competition, while McCrae was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"BBB Movie\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a few minutes to study three movie sets. They were then asked questions about how many of a certain item there were in a set. If the HouseGuest was confident in their answer, they would \"stay\" for an attempt at winning a movie ticket. The housemate that was closest to the correct answer would receive a movie ticket, while the others were eliminated. If they were not confident they would \"fold\" and stay in the competition regardless of their answer. The first HouseGuest to obtain three movie tickets would be the winner. Andy was the winner. On Day 53, Andy chose not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 56, in a unanimous vote of 6\u20130, Jessie was evicted and became the third jury member.\n\nFollowing Jessie's eviction, Aaryn won her fourth Head of Household of the season in the \"Way Off Broadway\" HoH competition. Later that day, Julie Chen revealed to the audience that one of the four jury members would be coming back on the next weeks eviction night. On Day 57, the HouseGuests competed in the Have-Not competition, \"The Black Box\". In this competition, the HouseGuests had to enter a big, pitch-black box with many crawl spaces and gags, find the key, and exit the black box and hit a button to stop the timer. Amanda, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen were the Have-Nots for the week. Aaryn then chose to nominate Elissa and Helen, with Helen being her target. Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer were selected to play in the Veto competition. On Day 58, Elissa went on to win her second Veto competition of the season. Elissa used the Veto to remove her nomination, and Aaryn nominated Spencer in her stead. On Day 63, Helen was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, with Elissa being the only one to vote for Spencer.\n\nShortly after Helen's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests and first four jurors competed in the \"Off the Wall\" competition, which functioned as both the HoH and re-entry competition. The HouseGuests and jurors were to stand on platforms and catch balls thrown at them without falling off. The first player overall to catch 10 balls or last to remain standing would be the new HoH, and the first juror to do so would return to the game. Judd was the last juror left standing and returned to the game as a HouseGuest, and Elissa was the first to catch 10 balls and became Head of Household. On Day 64, Elissa nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. On Day 65, Amanda, GinaMarie, and Judd were selected to play in the Veto competition. Amanda won the Veto competition, her first individual competition win of the season. On Day 67, Amanda used the Power of Veto to save McCrae, causing Elissa to name Andy the replacement nominee. On Day 70, Aaryn was evicted by a vote of 5\u20130.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\">{{cite magazine|title = 'Big Brother 15': Latest Houseguest Evicted, Audience Gets Vocal|date = August 29, 2013|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-brother-15-ninth-houseguest-617564|last = Ng|first = Philiana|magazine = The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Aaryn's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests began the \"Big Hopportunity\" competition. The HouseGuests were to hop to a wall made from chicken wire. There, each HouseGuest navigated their egg them through a maze formed by the letters \"HoH\" to a hole at the far side. They then had to hop back down and drop the egg in their basket. GinaMarie was the first HouseGuest with a dozen eggs and won the HoH. On the live show, Julie Chen also announced that the HouseGuests will compete in a special competition, and a live double eviction during Week 10.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\" /> On Day 71, GinaMarie chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae for eviction. On Day 72, Spencer, Andy, and Elissa were selected to play in the Veto competition. McCrae won the Veto competition. On Day 74, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer was once again named the replacement nominee. On Day 77, Amanda was evicted in a 3\u20132 vote after GinaMarie was forced to break the tie.  Because this was also a double eviction week, the remaining HouseGuests went straight into the Head of Household competition, which McCrae won. McCrae (unaware that Andy was the one who had double crossed him and Amanda) nominated Elissa and GinaMarie shortly after. When Judd won the Power of Veto, he decided not to use it and Elissa was evicted in a unanimous 3\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Amanda and Elissa's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the following Head of Household competition, which Spencer won. He nominated GinaMarie and McCrae. On Day 79, McCrae won the Power of Veto, his third Veto win of the season. On Day 81, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer chose to name Judd as the replacement nominee. On Day 82, Judd was evicted from the house for a second time in a 2\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Judd's second eviction, Andy won his second HoH of the season in the \"Before or After\" HoH competition. On Day 83, he nominated McCrae and Spencer for eviction. That same day, the HouseGuests competed in the final Veto competition of the season, titled \"Web of (F)Lies.\" Andy won the Power of Veto. On Day 84, Andy decided not to use the Power of Veto. Immediately following the Veto ceremony, GinaMarie, with the sole vote to evict, choose to evict McCrae from the game.\n\nFollowing McCrae's eviction, the final three participated in the first part of the final HoH competition, \"The Great E-skate,\" with GinaMarie being the victor. On Day 86, Spencer and Andy competed in part two of the final HoH competition, \"Crab Grab,\" which Andy won. During the finale, Andy and GinaMarie faced off in the final part of the competition, \"Jury Statements\". Andy won the competition and, as final HoH, cast the sole vote to evict Spencer from the house. After asking questions to the final two, the nine-person jury voted to crown the season's winner. Andy won in with a 7\u20132 vote, and Elissa won $25,000 as America's Favorite HouseGuest, with Judd and Howard gaining the next-highest number of votes.<ref name=\"THR_finale\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

This was an illustrated Young Adult or children\u2019s version of the Margaret Catchpole story, about a pioneering convict woman and her life after emancipation, derived largely from Richard Cobbold\u2019s biographical Victorian novel, ''The History of Margaret Catchpole'' (1845).\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of convicts transported to Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Salmonson, Jessica Amanda.

A [[common chimpanzee]] who wears a [[deerstalker]] hat ([[wikt:\u00e0 la|\u00e0 la]] [[Knight|Sir]] [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s fictional [[Detective|sleuth]] [[Sherlock Holmes]]), Detective Chimp has human-level [[intelligence]] and solves crimes, often with the help of the Bureau of Amplified Animals, a group of intelligent animals that also includes [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. He was originally created in the final years of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], during the [[interregnum]] between the former and the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Detective Chimp | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 100  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\nAfter his initial appearance in ''Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog'' he continued to appear in that title as a backup feature until 1959,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/30/mode/2up/ |page=31}}</ref> at which point he faded into obscurity. Several decades after his last appearance, Detective Chimp appeared in several cameos, namely in a 1981 story, \"Whatever Happened to Rex the Wonder Dog?\" (''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #35) and later in a brief cameo  with [[Angel and the Ape|Sam Simeon]] in [[Gorilla City]] during 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Following these appearances, Bobo started appearing in DC titles with some regularity, appearing in issues of ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', and other titles. This eventually led to prominent roles in the 2005 ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries and subsequently as a regular in its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Shadowpact]]''. The character has gone on to guest-star in other DC Comics titles.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhen first introduced, Detective Chimp was a simple, although intelligent, trained chimpanzee, who acted as a \"helping [[mascot]]\" for the local sheriff, after helping him to solve the murder of his chimpanzee trainer, Fred Thorpe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |title=Detective Chimp |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/chimp.htm}}</ref> He could not speak, but could understand humans and make himself understood. Bobo, a smoker, is a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], and had a long-standing partnership with four other detectives as the Croatoan Society. One of the other former members of the Society was the detective/superhero [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]].\n\nThe Chimp's origin has been revamped and elaborated on several times since his initial Silver Age appearances. 1989's ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #40 credited the experimentation of a microscopic alien race with Bobo's intelligence. This origin has since been [[retcon]]ned, notably in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' six-part limited series. In the latter it was shown that Bobo was captured in Equatorial Africa in 1953 by Fred Thorpe, who sought to train him for his carnival act: \"Bobo the Detective Chimp\". For the act, Detective Chimp was trained to answer some detective-related questions using a combination of signals and rewards, giving the illusion that he could \"discover the deepest secrets of the public\". Bobo formed a strong bond with Thorpe because Thorpe took care of him, and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle. The success of the act lasted until a trip to Florida, at which time Rex the Wonder Dog, took him to the [[Fountain of Youth]], where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures, even humans, in their own language, as well as eternal youth. Rex's and Bobo's journey to the Fountain of Youth was originally depicted in the aforementioned ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #35, July 1981.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Wells|first = John|title = Flashback: Whatever Happened to...?|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = #64|pages = 51\u201361|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}</ref> The intelligence Bobo gained put a damper on the success of the sideshow act, and in at least one instance, he decided that a woman had in fact murdered her sister, and shared his insights with the local police.\n\nAt some point after this, Bobo was employed by the Bureau of Amplified Animals. It is not known how he left, or even if the Bureau still exists.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 3 #30</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Fred Thorpe, he began to work by himself. Initially he did quite well, as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty. During this successful period he was visited by another detective, John Jones (actually the [[Martian Manhunter]], during the ''JLApe'' crisis), who thought Bobo's agency seemed to be doing better than his own.<ref>''Martian Manhunter Annual'' #2</ref>\n\nHowever, as an ape, without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person, he could not enforce unpaid bills. When the public began to forget him, he became an alcoholic, never leaving the other-dimensional [[Oblivion Bar]] (which changed management twice during his time there), until the establishment was acquired by [[Nightmaster|Jim Rook]].\n\n\"Bobo\" is not his real name, which he declines to share.<ref>''Day of Vengeance'' #4. DC Comics.</ref> It is revealed by the Phantom Stranger to be \"mostly an unpronounceable screech and three grunts\", which translates as \"Magnificent Finder of Tasty Grubs\".<ref>''Shadowpact'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===Shadowpact===\n[[Image:Dchimpx.png|Detective Chimp in modern times. A panel from ''Day of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2006), art by Justiniano.|150px|left|thumb]]\nWhen the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] attempts to destroy all magic and began killing wizards, Detective Chimp, while still mostly drunk, coerces a group of mystical characters gathered from the Oblivion Bar into battling the Spectre. This leads to the formation of the group the [[Shadowpact]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nAlthough lacking superhuman powers, Detective Chimp exhibits not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician. Benefiting from the counsel of the [[Phantom Stranger]] (at the time transformed into a mouse), he devises a plan to use the powers of [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] and [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]] to confront the combined menace of [[Eclipso]] and the Spectre.\n\nBobo also helps clean up the demonic damage left from the Rock of Eternity's explosion over [[Gotham City]]. He captures the sin of \"Sloth\", which had possessed his long-time friend [[Rex the Wonder Dog]]. After the Rock is reformed, the sins re-imprisoned, and all magical influence cleaned out of Gotham, the dying [[Doctor Fate]] gives Detective Chimp the powerful Helmet of Fate. After finding it does not fit him, Detective Chimp convinces Captain Marvel to throw it to Earth, to let fate choose its next bearer.<ref>''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the helmet of Doctor Fate returns to Earth, Detective Chimp for a brief time bonds with it, granting him additional powers that he uses to assist the Gotham City police in apprehending the villain [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. After struggling against the temptation of the helmet, Bobo sends it on to another journey.<ref>''Helmet of Fate: Detective Chimp'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nRecently, it has been shown that Bobo occasionally assists [[Batman]] in his cases by way of a [[chat room]] where they swap theories. The [[Riddler]] is also known to chat with them, but he is unaware of the other two's identities.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #845</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn DC's [[The New 52|2011 reboot of its continuity]], Detective Chimp has been mentioned by [[Ambush Bug]] in the Channel 52 feature sections. He later appears as a brief cameo in aiding the [[Justice League United]] team rescue Adam Strange from the Zeta Beam <ref>''Justice League United'' #16 DC Comics</ref>and in the 2016 ''DC Comics Rebirth Christmas Special'' story \"The Night We Saved Christmas\".<ref>''DC Comics Rebirth Christmas Special 2016''. DC Comics</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nIn ''DC Rebirth'', Detective Chimp, a.k.a. Bobo, has appeared in the ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]'' event, he is one of the survivors of the invasion of the Dark Nights (alternate versions of Batman from a Dark Multiverse), he is seen at the Oblivion Bar alongside the [[Justice League]], [[Kendra Saunders]], Doctor Fate and others. Bobo's close friend Nightmaster, the owner of the Oblivion Bar, is killed in this confrontation. <ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #3 (October 2017)</ref> Bobo later takes over the bar and Nightmaster's mystical duties. <ref>''Justice League Dark'' #1 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDetective Chimp possesses no unusual physical abilities, save the level of agility and [[physical strength]] that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools. He is capable of conversing with all animals, regardless of origin, in their own language, including all spoken and written human languages. He is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world, with detective skills rivaling those of [[Ralph Dibny]] or [[Batman]]. Bobo has an Intelligence Quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population, as evidenced by his [[Mensa International|Mensa]] membership. For a brief time, Detective Chimp also had additional sense-expanding powers granted him by the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]].\n\nBecause a chimpanzee's muscles are much denser than a human's, Detective Chimp is unable to swim. Recent scientific evidence suggests that chimpanzees can swim, and this represents a continuity error (or Detective Chimp simply never learned to swim).\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Tangent: Superman's Reign''===\nIn ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent: Superman's Reign]]'', the Earth-9 version of Detective Chimp is revealed to be the screen name of a human hacker named [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].\n\n===''DC One Million'' and ''Dark Nights: Metal''===\nIn ''[[DC One Million]]'', the far future version of Detective Chimp is one of the heroes of the Gorilla Galaxy, and wears a costume similar to [[Batman]]'s.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Morrison, Grant| penciller= [[Dusty Abell|Abell, Dusty]]| inker= [[Jim Royal|Royal, Jim]]| story= Crisis One Million| title= [[DC One Million|DC One Million 80-Page Giant]]| issue= #1,000,000| date= August 1999}}</ref> In 2018's ''Dark Nights: Metal'' story arc, an identical character also appears with the same name and background, although now located on the [[DC Multiverse]] alternate Earth known as Earth 52 <ref> http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/16/dc-comics-unveils-earth-53-in-dark-knights-rising-the-wild-hunt/ </ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nDetective Chimp plays a key role in the opening issues of Year Three. [[John Constantine]] tracks down 'the world's greatest detective' - normally the moniker applied to [[Batman]] - to assist in defeating a fascistic [[Superman]]. At first, Chimp drunkenly curses Constantine, but then agrees to join him as he and Batman appear in the back of [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Chas Chandler]]'s cab, where he and John mock the brooding detectives. Constantine then leads him and Batman to a church where he has magically sealed [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], much to Chimp's surprise. Chimp then asks John why he is involved in this war between Batman and Superman, but Constantine explains how the conflict with the [[Green Lantern Corps]] killed his daughter Rose's mother and he wants revenge on Superman. Batman then gathers his allies, including Chimp, at [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]]'s home, where Batman and Constantine try to explain their plan. Detective [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], though, announces that he plans on leaving, feeling that he is out of his element in this world of superheroes, but Chimp stops him and reveals that he knows his reputation as a detective and his work with Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|Gordon]] in the past on several cases. Chimp then admits he feels outside his own comfort zone but he is still here for the same reason that Gordon is and asks him to stay. Before Bullock can answer, [[Klarion the Witch Boy]]'s cat, Teekl, senses something coming as Jason realizes his home's protective seal was broken when Bullock opened the door. Before Bullock can close the door, the Spectre vaporizes both Bullock and Blood, with Chimp getting caught in the blast. [[Alfred Pennyworth]], though, manages to save Chimp as he, [[Zatanna]], and [[Harley Quinn]], manage to keep him alive, where Alfred carries his body while Zatanna teleports the others to the Tower of Fate. Chimp then awakens and grasps Harley's hand as she, Alfred, and Zatanna try to keep him alive, where it is revealed that Chimp is missing an eye. [[Doctor Fate]] then appears to take Constantine's daughter, Rose, away. Harley, though, demands Fate to help him save Chimp, but Fate says he cannot help him. Harley Quinn and Klarion the Witch Boy save Chimp's life, but Chimp loses the use of one eye and has to wear an eye patch. When Sinestro later kills Klarion, Chimp tells the assembled group that, without Klarion, he will cease to exist and fades away in front of Harley and the other rebels.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Detective Chimp appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"The Golden Age of Justice!\", voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Unlike the comic book version who speaks with a [[Boston]] accent, this version of Detective Chimp speaks in a pronounced [[British English|English]] dialect. In the teaser, Batman and the seemingly animal-like Chimp try to figure out who stole the Golden Skull. The thief is revealed to be [[False-Face]]. After False-Face is defeated, Detective Chimp surprises the people watching by revealing he could talk by telling Batman \"Don't patronize me, 'old chum'\". He appears again in \"Gorillas in Our Midst\", helping Batman stop Gorilla Grodd when he replaces [[Gotham City]]'s human population with gorillas. During the adventure, he expresses romantic interest in the super-heroine [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] despite her different species. In this episode, the word \"ape\" is used to indicate something besides gorillas which does not include chimps or humans in spite of both being a species of ape.\n* Detective Chimp makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode \"You're Fired!\", voiced by [[Scott Menville]]. He is the third character to audition as [[Beast Boy]]'s replacement, but is rejected the moment he introduces himself.\n\n===Films===\n* Detective Chimp appears along with Batman, Black Canary, Question, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and Plastic Man to help Scooby-Doo and the gang solve one of his few unsolved cases in ''[[Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', with [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] reprising his role.\n* A brief glimpse of a Detective Chimp movie poster appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]''. He also appears at both movie premieres of ''Batman Again'' and ''Robin: The Movie.''\n\n===Video games===\n* Detective Chimp appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n* Detective Chimp was originally set to appear as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', but was cut from the game for unknown reasons.<ref>https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/10/12/injustice-2-concept-art-constantine-penguin/</ref>\n* Detective Chimp appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.\n\n===Toys===\nDetective Chimp was the 69th issue in the [[DC Comics Super Hero Collection]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nDetective Chimp appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' #39, working alongside fellow detectives [[Batman]] and [[Elongated Man]]. In the [[DC Animated Universe]] continuity, Detective Chimp is portrayed as a citizen of Gorilla City, but does not actually appear until the end of the story, as he had been impersonated by [[Gorilla Grodd]] for much of the issue.

Bobo's close friend Nightmaster, the owner of the Oblivion Bar, is killed in this confrontation. <ref>''Dark Nights: Metal'' #3 (October 2017)</ref> Bobo later takes over the bar and Nightmaster's mystical duties. <ref>''Justice League Dark'' #1 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDetective Chimp possesses no unusual physical abilities, save the level of agility and [[physical strength]] that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools. He is capable of conversing with all animals, regardless of origin, in their own language, including all spoken and written human languages. He is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world, with detective skills rivaling those of [[Ralph Dibny]] or [[Batman]]. Bobo has an Intelligence Quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult (human) population, as evidenced by his [[Mensa International|Mensa]] membership. For a brief time, Detective Chimp also had additional sense-expanding powers granted him by the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]].\n\nBecause a chimpanzee's muscles are much denser than a human's, Detective Chimp is unable to swim. Recent scientific evidence suggests that chimpanzees can swim, and this represents a continuity error (or Detective Chimp simply never learned to swim).\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Tangent: Superman's Reign''===\nIn ''[[Tangent Comics|Tangent: Superman's Reign]]'', the Earth-9 version of Detective Chimp is revealed to be the screen name of a human hacker named [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].\n\n===''DC One Million'' and ''Dark Nights: Metal''===\nIn ''[[DC One Million]]'', the far future version of Detective Chimp is one of the heroes of the Gorilla Galaxy, and wears a costume similar to [[Batman]]'s.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Morrison, Grant| penciller= [[Dusty Abell|Abell, Dusty]]| inker= [[Jim Royal|Royal, Jim]]| story= Crisis One Million| title= [[DC One Million|DC One Million 80-Page Giant]]| issue= #1,000,000| date= August 1999}}</ref> In 2018's ''Dark Nights: Metal'' story arc, an identical character also appears with the same name and background, although now located on the [[DC Multiverse]] alternate Earth known as Earth 52 <ref> http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/16/dc-comics-unveils-earth-53-in-dark-knights-rising-the-wild-hunt/ </ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nDetective Chimp plays a key role in the opening issues of Year Three. [[John Constantine]] tracks down 'the world's greatest detective' - normally the moniker applied to [[Batman]] - to assist in defeating a fascistic [[Superman]]. At first, Chimp drunkenly curses Constantine, but then agrees to join him as he and Batman appear in the back of [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Chas Chandler]]'s cab, where he and John mock the brooding detectives. Constantine then leads him and Batman to a church where he has magically sealed [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], much to Chimp's surprise. Chimp then asks John why he is involved in this war between Batman and Superman, but Constantine explains how the conflict with the [[Green Lantern Corps]] killed his daughter Rose's mother and he wants revenge on Superman. Batman then gathers his allies, including Chimp, at [[Etrigan the Demon|Jason Blood]]'s home, where Batman and Constantine try to explain their plan. Detective [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], though, announces that he plans on leaving, feeling that he is out of his element in this world of superheroes, but Chimp stops him and reveals that he knows his reputation as a detective and his work with Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|Gordon]] in the past on several cases. Chimp then admits he feels outside his own comfort zone but he is still here for the same reason that Gordon is and asks him to stay. Before Bullock can answer, [[Klarion the Witch Boy]]'s cat, Teekl, senses something coming as Jason realizes his home's protective seal was broken when Bullock opened the door. Before Bullock can close the door, the Spectre vaporizes both Bullock and Blood, with Chimp getting caught in the blast. [[Alfred Pennyworth]], though, manages to save Chimp as he, [[Zatanna]], and [[Harley Quinn]], manage to keep him alive, where Alfred carries his body while Zatanna teleports the others to the Tower of Fate. Chimp then awakens and grasps Harley's hand as she, Alfred, and Zatanna try to keep him alive, where it is revealed that Chimp is missing an eye. [[Doctor Fate]] then appears to take Constantine's daughter, Rose, away. Harley, though, demands Fate to help him save Chimp, but Fate says he cannot help him. Harley Quinn and Klarion the Witch Boy save Chimp's life, but Chimp loses the use of one eye and has to wear an eye patch. When Sinestro later kills Klarion, Chimp tells the assembled group that, without Klarion, he will cease to exist and fades away in front of Harley and the other rebels.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Detective Chimp appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"The Golden Age of Justice!\", voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Unlike the comic book version who speaks with a [[Boston]] accent, this version of Detective Chimp speaks in a pronounced [[British English|English]] dialect. In the teaser, Batman and the seemingly animal-like Chimp try to figure out who stole the Golden Skull. The thief is revealed to be [[False-Face]]. After False-Face is defeated, Detective Chimp surprises the people watching by revealing he could talk by telling Batman \"Don't patronize me, 'old chum'\". He appears again in \"Gorillas in Our Midst\", helping Batman stop Gorilla Grodd when he replaces [[Gotham City]]'s human population with gorillas. During the adventure, he expresses romantic interest in the super-heroine [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] despite her different species. In this episode, the word \"ape\" is used to indicate something besides gorillas which does not include chimps or humans in spite of both being a species of ape.\n* Detective Chimp makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode \"You're Fired!\", voiced by [[Scott Menville]]. He is the third character to audition as [[Beast Boy]]'s replacement, but is rejected the moment he introduces himself.\n\n===Films===\n* Detective Chimp appears along with Batman, Black Canary, Question, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and Plastic Man to help Scooby-Doo and the gang solve one of his few unsolved cases in ''[[Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', with [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] reprising his role.\n* A brief glimpse of a Detective Chimp movie poster appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]''. He also appears at both movie premieres of ''Batman Again'' and ''Robin: The Movie.''\n\n===Video games===\n* Detective Chimp appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n* Detective Chimp was originally set to appear as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', but was cut from the game for unknown reasons.<ref>https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/10/12/injustice-2-concept-art-constantine-penguin/</ref>\n* Detective Chimp appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.\n\n===Toys===\nDetective Chimp was the 69th issue in the [[DC Comics Super Hero Collection]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nDetective Chimp appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' #39, working alongside fellow detectives [[Batman]] and [[Elongated Man]]. In the [[DC Animated Universe]] continuity, Detective Chimp is portrayed as a citizen of Gorilla City, but does not actually appear until the end of the story, as he had been impersonated by [[Gorilla Grodd]] for much of the issue.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thrillingdetective.com/eyes/bobo.html ''The Thrilling Detective Web Site''- Detective Chimp]\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/chimp.htm ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'' Detective Chimp]\n* [http://dccomics.com/sites/52/?action=headlines&i=6398 '''''52''': This Chimp Can Chat'' Faux interview with Detective Chimp]\n* [http://aquamanrules.blogspot.com/2010/05/well-if-youre-going-to-ape-sherlock.html Silver Age Gold: Well, If You're Going to \"Ape\" Sherlock Holmes...]\n\n{{Justice League Dark}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Animal superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Fictional chimpanzees]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1952]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Broome]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carmine Infantino]]\n[[Category:DC Comics fantasy characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional Mensans]]\n", "name_user": "DeeXQuan", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eIn other media:Added other stories related to the topic.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Chimp"}

It was proposed to be the [[biblical Mount Sinai]] by [[Menashe Har-El]], a biblical [[geographer]] at [[Tel Aviv University]] in his book ''The Sinai Journeys: The Route of the Exodus''.<ref>''The Sinai Journeys, The Route of the Exodus'', Menashe Har-El, Ridgefield Publishing, San Diego, pp. 420-421, 1983, {{ISBN|0866280162}}.</ref> This location was used for Zondervan's ''NIV Atlas of the Bible''.<ref>''NIV Atlas of the Bible'', C.

These include\n* the southern Sinai peninsula (including the traditional location of Gabal Horeb)\n* the northern Sinai peninsula\n* the central Sinai peninsula\n* the Suder valley in the west-central Sinai peninsula\n* Midian and Edom.\nAll locations have proponents, but Gabal Horeb in the southern peninsula has been the traditional location since the 4th&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD (but notably not before). \n\nThe Old Testament prophet Elijah, according to 1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19, is the last person recorded in the Bible as visiting Mount Sinai. The account of his visit does not give geographical details that help determine the actual location, but suggests the location was known long after the Jewish people left the mountain. Unfortunately, there are no surviving extra-biblical documents that mark the location. Whether the Second Temple's sacred books (given by Roman General Titus to [[Josephus]]) contained information on the location of Mount Sinai is unknown, but Josephus did write about the mountain. However, Dr.&nbsp;Har-El was a geologist and he discusses in detail the geographic and  environmental markers in Sinai, which do survive to the present day. He notes how they compare with the biblical account. \n\nDr. Har-El gave nine main reasons why he believed the traditional location of Gabal Horeb (Gabal Musa)in southern Sinai was not Mount Sinai:\n{| style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:20pt;\" | (a)\n| The geology, soils, and vegetation in the southern peninsula could not support the Jewish people for the year they dwelt there.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (b)\n| In southern Sinai, there are numerous oases, but they are not mentioned in the Bible (yet the Bible mentions in detail other oases and natural features on the Exodus route).\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (c)\n| Natural conditions in the southern Sinai would not have allowed for enough food (other than fish) for the Jewish people to survive.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (d)\n| There are fishing grounds in the southern Sinai, but the Jewish people complained in Numbers&nbsp;11:5 that they missed the fish they used to eat in Egypt. Complaining of a lack of fish in one's diet when in southern Sinai it could be found nearby undermines this location as a candidate.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (e)\n| Southern Sinai does not lie on the route to Canaan or Kadesh-Barnea.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (f)\n| Critically, southern Sinai does not lie on the route to Midian from Egypt. Moses had camped at Mount Sinai when returning to Egypt from Midian with his wife and son. He also met Aaron there when returning to Egypt from Midian (Exodus&nbsp;4:27) on a different trip. Thus strongly suggests Mount Sinai was located near the ancient road connecting Egypt to Midian \u2013 a road still used today as an Islamic pilgrimage route to Mecca from Egypt.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (g)\n| Mount Sinai should be three days journey from Egypt, based on Pharaoh's request of Moses in Exodus&nbsp;8:24, and Exodus&nbsp;5:3. This would rule out Mount Sinai being in southern Egypt, which was much further away.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (h)\n| There were copper and turquoise mines in southern Sinai that may have been guarded by the Egyptian army. The Jewish people are unlikely to have willingly remained near any military outposts after leaving their homes in Goshen.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (i)\n| Gabal Sin Bishar is eleven days journey to Kadesh-Barnea, fulfilling Deuteronomy&nbsp;1:2. The candidates in southern Sinai are much further away. Dr.&nbsp;Har-El also argued against the other southern locations for the same reason.\n|}\n\n==Gabal Sin Bishar & Suder Valley==\nHar-El believes the evidence supports Mount Sinai being located in the Suder Valley in the west-central Sinai Peninsula. His reasons include:\n{| style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; width:20pt;\" | (a) \n| This region is far enough from potential Egyptian armies in the mining region of the south and the road in the north along the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 the ''Way of the Land of the Philistines'' \u2013 to survive without encountering Egyptian troops. \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (b) \n| The Suder Valley is located in an area known to have been used by Semitic people who traveled to Egypt (1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:17\u201318). \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (c) \n| The meeting between Aaron and Moses (Exodus&nbsp;4:27) likely took place on the road between Midian and Egypt, but closer to Egypt. \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (d) \n| The Suder valley fits the wilderness described in the Bible. \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (e) \n| \"Gabal Sin Bishar\" means \"the reporting of the law\" or \"the laws of man\", and this is the only mountain where, possibly, the name \"Sinai\" has been preserved in the name \"sin\". \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (f) \n| Har-El cites Josephus' writings, who had access to the Jewish Temple's sacred books that he was given by Roman General Titus after the fall of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;AD. Josephus writes that the mountain was the highest mountain in its surroundings. The prominence of Gabal Sin Bishar is tooth-shaped and stands out from its surroundings, despite being 618&nbsp;meters above sea level and only 300&nbsp;meters above the landscape. This also means it is not so high that it would be difficult for 80&nbsp;year-old Moses to go up and down four times (Exodus chapters&nbsp;19\u201334) or too difficult for the Aaron and the 70&nbsp;elders to go up with him. \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (g) \n| There are graves and pottery from the middle Bronze Age. \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (h) \n| There are circular piles of stones at the base of Gabal Sin Bishar (Exodus&nbsp;24:4). \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (i) \n| Notably, it addresses Pharaoh's request to not go far outside of Egypt (three days from the border as prescribed in Exodus&nbsp;3:24). \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (j) \n| There is a widespread presence of chalk and flint in Wadi Suder. (Exodus&nbsp;4:24\u201326 records that Moses' son was circumcised on short notice using flint at the base of the mountain.) \n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | (k) \n| The pastureland and water nearby could have supported the Jewish people for a year.\n|}\n\n==Other Evidence==\nDr. Har-El links Gabal Sin Bishar with a probable route the Jewish people took when fleeing Pharaoh across the Bitter Lakes, where Moses divided the Sea of Reeds. He also links Gabal Sin Bishar with the way stations and travel times the Jewish people took toward the Promised Land when they left Mount Sinai. Unfortunately, due to an Egyptian military presence near Gabal Sin Bishar, the ability of archeologists to further investigate this location is not an option.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Mountains of Egypt|Sin Bishar]]\n[[Category:Mount Sinai]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|29.671|32.961|display=title|name=Jebel Sin Bishar}}\n'''Gabal Sin Bishar''' (also called '''Jebel Sin Bishar''' or '''Mount Sin Bishar''') is a mountain located in west-central [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]].

She had a long-term relationship with the [[surgery|surgeon]], [[William Balmain]] and is considered as one of [[Australia]]'s 'founding mothers', whose descendants still live in Australia, others in Britain.\n\nUnusually for a transported convict, she returned from New South Wales and died in England. \n\n==Early life==\nShe came from [[Liverpool]] and in 1786 was employed in [[London]] as a servant in the house of Joseph and Frances Shetley.  On the afternoon of Sunday, 12 February 1786, while her employers were out of the house, Dawson collected a large quantity of clothing, jewellery, and money, and left the house.  Mrs Shetley returned home and found the house in disorder and the young servant girl missing.  She sent for Mr Shetley, who set out to follow Dawson that evening.  Knowing she came from the Liverpool area, he asked after her at the Golden Cross at [[Charing Cross]] and was told that a girl of her description had boarded the coach for [[Chester]] in the north at 7.00 p.m.  Mr Shetley took a [[Chaise|postchaise]]  with a Mr Lowe, and overtook the coach at [[St Albans]].  Dawson was found on the roof of the coach, apprehended, and taken into a local Inn where she handed over the stolen goods from her pockets and two boxes.  The goods were recognised by Mr Shetley, the only item missing being a [[British coin Guinea|guinea]] coin which she had used to pay for the coach.  When asked if she had acted with an accomplice or was travelling with anyone, she said she wasn't.  Dawson was then taken back to London and Mrs Shetley identified the items of clothing.\n==Biography==\nMargaret Dawson's trial record, like those of most of her fellow convicts, remains silent as to her motive for theft.  Historians can only speculate as to whether her actions resulted from her treatment by her employer, a family crisis pulling her back home, a threat from an unknown person, or a simple failure to resist the temptation of an empty house.\n\nAt her trial at the [[Old Bailey]] on 22 February 1786 for \"feloniously stealing\" goods to the value of \u00a312 4s 1d, Mr Lowe stated that she was so changed in appearance that he would not have recognised her.  In her defence, Dawson said \"I have nothing to say, I have no witnesses.\"  She was found guilty and sentenced to the mandatory sentence of death.  The prosecutor and jury recommended mercy on account of her youth, being only fifteen, and it being her first offence.\n\nAfter ten months in [[Newgate Prison]], in conditions where malnutrition, filth, and violence were common, Dawson was returned to court. Here, on 4 January 1787, her death sentence was commuted \"on condition of being transported for [a term of seven years], to the Eastern coast of New South Wales, or some one or other of the islands adjacent\".\n\nOn 26 January, she was delivered from Newgate to the ''[[Lady Penrhyn (1786 ship)|Lady Penrhyn]]'', then moored in the [[River Thames]]. Conditions here were no better than in prison, with the women on board described as \"almost naked and so very filthy\" and \"where there are very many venereal complaints\".  She sailed with the Fleet for New South Wales from [[Portsmouth]] on 13 May 1787, arriving after a cramped and insanitary voyage of seven months at [[Sydney Cove]] in [[Port Jackson]] on 26 January 1788.\n\nAfter the time needed for land to be cleared and huts built, Dawson and 189 other female convicts went ashore on 6 February.  Here, it was reported by one onlooker \"the convicts got to them very soon after they landed, and it is beyond my abilities to give a just description of the scenes of debauchery and riot that ensued during the night.\"\n\nIn August 1789 the convict John Hayes received fifty lashes in a [[flagellation|flogging]] ordered for his \"infamous Behaviour\" towards Dawson.  Perhaps it was this event that brought her to the attention of the assistant surgeon, William Balmain.  It is not known whether she assisted Balmain in tending to the large number of sick convicts who arrived in mid-1790 in the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]].\n\nIn November 1791, Dawson and Balmain travelled together, with [[Philip Gidley King]], to [[Norfolk Island]] on Atlantic, where Balmain was going to take up the post of Lieutenant Governor.  Dawson's penal sentence expired in January 1793, and soon after she signed a receipt for payment for some grain sold to the government stores, indicating she was literate, free, and farming some land.  Her first child, a daughter, was born on Norfolk Island in May 1794.  \n\nDawson and Balmain returned to Sydney in August 1795. There, Dawson had two more children, a girl and a boy, with Balmain.  Their older daughter died on 4 September 1797.\n\nThe family left Sydney in August 1801, and arrived in London in March 1802, an absence for Dawson of just under fifteen years.  In May 1803 Dawson, now pregnant again with their fourth child, and the children, were sent to [[Ormskirk]], near Liverpool.\n\nOn 17 November 1803 William Balmain died.  In his will, dated four days before his death, he left a yearly sum of \u00a350 to \"my dear friend Margaret Dawson, otherwise Henderson ... whose tenderness to me, while in ill health, claims my warmest gratitude and by whom I have had two natural children \u2026 and who is now ensient\".  \n\nNo doubt due to her convict status, in contrast to Balmain's professional position, he felt unable to marry her. She and her children had taken the surname 'Henderson\", which was Balmain's mother's maiden name.\n\nDawson left Ormskirk and gave birth to the fourth child in London.  Little is known of this baby, except that it was a girl, and still living with the family at [[Clement's Inn]] in January 1807.\n\nWith a settled income of \u00a350 a year, and rent from properties in New South Wales, it is unlikely that Dawson would have had to earn a living after Balmain's death.  With the help of his friends she continued to encourage her son John William Henderson's education, and he eventually returned to New South Wales in January 1829 as a surgeon, like his father. \n\nOn 16 February 1816, while living at [[St James's, Westminster]], Dawson died, and was buried in the churchyard of [[St Giles in the Fields|St-Giles-in-the-Fields]], where Balmain had also been buried. Following her death, Balmain's executors paid \u00a312 10s for her \"last sickness and funeral expenses\".\n\n==Further reading==\n* Reynolds, Peter, ''William Balmain and John Gilchrist: family and property'', Balmain Historical Monograph No. 5, Sydney, Leichhardt Historical Journal Inc., 2003.\n* Gillen, Mollie, ''The Founders of Australia: a biographical dictionary of the First Fleet'', Sydney, Library of Australian History, 1989, {{ISBN|0-908120-69-9}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dawson, Margaret}}\n{{Convicts in Australia}}\n[[Category:1770 births]]\n[[Category:1816 deaths]]\n[[Category:Convicts transported to Australia on the First Fleet]]\n[[Category:Convicts transported to Australia]]\n[[Category:18th-century Australian women]]\n[[Category:English female criminals]]\n[[Category:People from Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Criminals from Merseyside]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the anti-vivisectionist and philanthropist|Margaret Damer Dawson}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=March 2016}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox criminal\n| name = Margaret Dawson\n| birth_date  = {{birth-date|1770}}\n| birth_place = [[Liverpool]], England\n| death_date = {{Death-date|16 February 1816}} \n| death_place = [[Westminster St James]], [[Middlesex]], England\n| spouse         = William Balmain, (2 February 1762 \u2013 17 November 1803)\n}}\n'''Margaret Dawson''' (c.1770 \u2013 16 February 1816) was a [[convict]] on the [[First Fleet]] sent from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to [[New South Wales]] in 1787.  She had a long-term relationship with the [[surgery|surgeon]], [[William Balmain]] and is considered as one of [[Australia]]'s 'founding mothers', whose descendants still live in Australia, others in Britain.\n\nUnusually for a transported convict, she returned from New South Wales and died in England. \n\n==Early life==\nShe came from [[Liverpool]] and in 1786 was employed in [[London]] as a servant in the house of Joseph and Frances Shetley.  On the afternoon of Sunday, 12 February 1786, while her employers were out of the house, Dawson collected a large quantity of clothing, jewellery, and money, and left the house.  Mrs Shetley returned home and found the house in disorder and the young servant girl missing.  She sent for Mr Shetley, who set out to follow Dawson that evening.  Knowing she came from the Liverpool area, he asked after her at the Golden Cross at [[Charing Cross]] and was told that a girl of her description had boarded the coach for [[Chester]] in the north at 7.00 p.m.  Mr Shetley took a [[Chaise|postchaise]]  with a Mr Lowe, and overtook the coach at [[St Albans]].  Dawson was found on the roof of the coach, apprehended, and taken into a local Inn where she handed over the stolen goods from her pockets and two boxes.  The goods were recognised by Mr Shetley, the only item missing being a [[British coin Guinea|guinea]] coin which she had used to pay for the coach.  When asked if she had acted with an accomplice or was travelling with anyone, she said she wasn't.  Dawson was then taken back to London and Mrs Shetley identified the items of clothing.\n==Biography==\nMargaret Dawson's trial record, like those of most of her fellow convicts, remains silent as to her motive for theft.  Historians can only speculate as to whether her actions resulted from her treatment by her employer, a family crisis pulling her back home, a threat from an unknown person, or a simple failure to resist the temptation of an empty house.\n\nAt her trial at the [[Old Bailey]] on 22 February 1786 for \"feloniously stealing\" goods to the value of \u00a312 4s 1d, Mr Lowe stated that she was so changed in appearance that he would not have recognised her.  In her defence, Dawson said \"I have nothing to say, I have no witnesses.\"  She was found guilty and sentenced to the mandatory sentence of death.  The prosecutor and jury recommended mercy on account of her youth, being only fifteen, and it being her first offence.\n\nAfter ten months in [[Newgate Prison]], in conditions where malnutrition, filth, and violence were common, Dawson was returned to court. Here, on 4 January 1787, her death sentence was commuted \"on condition of being transported for [a term of seven years], to the Eastern coast of New South Wales, or some one or other of the islands adjacent\".\n\nOn 26 January, she was delivered from Newgate to the ''[[Lady Penrhyn (1786 ship)|Lady Penrhyn]]'', then moored in the [[River Thames]]. Conditions here were no better than in prison, with the women on board described as \"almost naked and so very filthy\" and \"where there are very many venereal complaints\".
