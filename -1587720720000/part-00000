The bones are the [[palatine process of the maxilla]] and the [[horizontal plate of palatine bone]]. The hard palate spans the [[alveolar process|alveolar arch]] formed by the [[alveolar process]] that holds the upper [[teeth]] (when these are developed).\n\n==Structure==\nThe hard palate is formed by the [[palatine process of the maxilla]] and [[horizontal plate of palatine bone]]. It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the [[mouth]]. On the anterior portion of the hard palate are the plicae, irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backward towards the larynx. This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the [[soft palate]].\nIt\u2019s sensory innervation is greater palatine nerve and nasopalatine nerve but it\u2019s motor is glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\n==Function==\nThe hard palate is important for feeding and speech. Mammals with a defective hard palate may die shortly after birth due to inability to suckle (see [[#Cleft palate|Cleft palate]] below). It is also involved in [[mastication]] in many species. The interaction between the [[tongue]] and the hard palate is essential in the formation of certain [[Speech communication|speech]] sounds, notably [[palatal consonant]]s such as {{IPA|/j/}} and /t/\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Cleft palate===\nIn the [[birth defect]] called [[cleft palate]], the left and right portions of this plate are not joined, forming a gap between the mouth and nasal passage (a related defect affecting the face is [[cleft lip]]).\n\nWhile a cleft palate has a severe impact upon the ability to [[lactation|nurse]] and speak, it is now successfully treated through reconstructive [[surgery|surgical]] procedures at an early age. This is the time where such procedures are available.\n\nDue to the complexity of this birth defect, researchers still do not know exactly what causes the cleft palate to develop during human development. Recently, these researchers found that even though there is no exact cause, there are several risk factors that drastically increase the risk of a baby being born with an orofacial cleft palate. As for the environmental risk factors, maternal smoking is the most influential risk factor. Based on a recent study of 103 German patients with cleft palates, it was found that 25.2% of them developed the defect due to excessive maternal smoking during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reiter |first1=Rudolf |last2=Brosch |first2=Sibylle |last3=Luedeke |first3=Manuel |last4=Fischbein |first4=Elena |last5=Haase |first5=S |last6=Pickhard |first6=A |last7=Assum |first7=G |last8=Schwandt |first8=A |last9=Vogel |first9=W |last10=Maier |first10=C |last11=Hogel |first11=J |title=Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Submucous Cleft Palate. |journal=European Journal of Oral Sciences |date=April 2012 |volume=120 |issue=2 |page=97 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0722.2012.00948.x |pmid=22409215 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221695097 |accessdate=23 November 2019 |ref=4}}</ref> \n\nWhile maternal smoking during pregnancy is a risk, there are also several genetic risk factors.

It was named for Admiral [[C. Turner Joy|Charles Turner Joy]] USN (1895&ndash;1956). Commissioned in 1959, it spent its entire career in the Pacific. It participated extensively in the [[Vietnam War]], and was one of the principal ships involved in the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]].\n\nDecommissioned in 1982, it is now a [[museum ship]] in Bremerton, Washington.\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' was built by the [[Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company]] of Seattle and commissioned at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]]. Her [[keel]] was laid on 30 September 1957. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 5 May 1958, sponsored by Mrs. C. Turner Joy, and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 August 1959.hi\n\n== Pre-Vietnam War operational duty ==\nFollowing a pre-shakedown goodwill cruise to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n ports and shakedown out of [[San Diego]], ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' began, early in 1960, duty as [[flagship]] both of Destroyer Squadron&nbsp;13 (DesRon&nbsp;13) and Destroyer Division&nbsp;131 (DesDiv&nbsp;131). Based at [[Long Beach, California]], she formed part of an [[antisubmarine warfare]] (ASW) task group built around {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}. She conducted exercises along the [[California]] coast until 17&nbsp;May 1960, when she sailed with the task group for the western [[Pacific]].\n\nAfter stops at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Apra, Guam]], she stood air-sea rescue duty near the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] for President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s flight to visit several [[Asia]]n nations. After returning to Apra briefly, the destroyer moved via the [[Philippines]] to [[Bangkok, Thailand]]. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' crossed the president's path once more in July&nbsp;1960, when the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] used the latter's visit to [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] as a pretext for [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis|shelling the islands]] of [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], once again. A tense month of duty with the [[Taiwan Strait]] patrol followed as the United States Navy demonstrated America's support for one of her allies. In mid-August&nbsp;1960, the warship moved north for exercises with [[U.S. 7th Fleet|7th&nbsp;Fleet]] carriers along the coast of [[Japan]]. That duty rounded out her first western Pacific deployment, and the destroyer got underway for [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], Japan, and headed home.\n\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' returned to Long Beach on 16 November 1960. Over the next 18&nbsp;months, she completed an extensive overhaul and participated in numerous 1st&nbsp;Fleet exercises along the California coast. In October&nbsp;1961, the destroyer was transferred to DesDiv&nbsp;191 of DesRon&nbsp;19 and assumed duty as flagship for both. On 2&nbsp;June 1962, she stood out of Long Beach with an ASW task group built around ''Hornet''. On her way to the [[Far East]], the warship participated in exercises with Amphibious Squadron&nbsp;5 in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Later, she joined the screen of {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}}, operating off the southern coast of [[Honsh\u016b]], Japan.\n\nHer second deployment to the Orient was characterized by a series of exercises with ships of the 7th Fleet and of allied navies. Areas of operations included the [[Sea of Japan]], the Pacific east of Japan, and the [[South China Sea]]. After a final series of drills conducted with {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31|6}}, the destroyer completed that tour of duty at Yokosuka, Japan, early in December. On 7&nbsp;June, she headed back to the United States where she arrived on 21&nbsp;June. The ensuing 14&nbsp;months brought another overhaul as well as further [[U.S. 1st Fleet|1st&nbsp;Fleet]] exercises in the waters along the west coast. Those evolutions continued into 1964; and, in March, the destroyer began preparations for overseas movement.\n\n==Gulf of Tonkin Incident==\n{{main|Gulf of Tonkin Incident}}\nOn 13 March 1964, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' departed Long Beach to embark upon her most celebrated tour of duty in the Far East. The third western Pacific deployment of her career began routinely enough. After calling at Pearl Harbor on her way west, the destroyer joined a task group built around {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} for operations in the [[Philippine Sea]], followed by a cruise through the South China Sea to Japan. Further training operations and port visits ensued, as the deployment continued peacefully. During late July&nbsp;1964, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'', while attached to a carrier task group built around {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, began making \"watch dog\" patrols off the coast of [[Vietnam]] where a [[guerrilla war]] had been raging at varying levels of intensity since the end of [[World War II]].\n\nIn the afternoon of 2&nbsp;August 1964, {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}}, engaged in a [[DESOTO patrol]], called for assistance when three [[Vietnam People's Navy]] (VPN) [[P 4-class torpedo boat]]s from the 135th&nbsp;Torpedo Squadron attacked her.<ref>Moise, p. 78.</ref> As ''Maddox'' engaged the boats, firing over 280&nbsp;five-inch shells, the contact was broken, and each combatant withdrew from the contact. While retreating to the North Vietnamese coastline, the three torpedo boats were attacked by four Navy [[F-8 Crusader]] jets from ''Ticonderoga'' which fired rockets and strafed with [[20mm]] cannon fire, damaging two torpedo boats and leaving one boat in apparently sinking condition.<ref>Moise, pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Meanwhile, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' raced to ''Maddox'' to provide additional surface strength. By the time she reached ''Maddox'', the torpedo boats were no longer in the area.\n\nOn 3 August 1964, the ''Turner Joy'' was ordered to accompany the ''Maddox'' for another DESOTO mission,<ref>Moise, p. 94.</ref> on 4&nbsp;August ''Turner&nbsp;Joy''{{'}}s radar screens picked up a number of what appeared to be small, high-speed surface craft approaching, but at extreme range. As a precaution, the two destroyers called upon ''Ticonderoga'' to furnish air support. By nightfall, the unidentified radar echoes suggested that VPN torpedo boats were converging upon the two American warships from the west and south. ''Turner Joy'' reported that she sighted one or two torpedo wakes, then rang up full speed, maneuvered radically to evade expected torpedoes, and began firing in the direction of the unidentified blips.<ref>Moise, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> Over the next two and a half hours, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' fired approximately 220&nbsp;five-inch shells, while planes from ''Ticonderoga'' fired at the supposed torpedo boats.<ref>Moise, p. 160.</ref>\n\nReports claimed that at least two of those were sunk by direct hits and another pair severely damaged, and that the remaining boats retired rapidly to the north.  A sailor in the Gun Director on the USS ''Maddox'', Patrick Park, reviewed radar and sonar records for the next three days after the incident on orders from his superiors.  His conclusion, there were no attacks on 4 August 1964 against the ''Maddox'' and the ''Turner Joy''.<ref name=\"WorldNews\">{{cite web |url= http://wn.com/tonkin_gulf_incident |title=Tonkin Gulf Incident |work=[[World News Network]] |year=2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> This has been supported by evidence from the Vietnamese since the end of hostilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html |title=McNamara asks Giap: What happened in Tonkin Gulf? |work=Associated Press |year=1999 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306124920/http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html |archivedate=6 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, Admiral Moore reported on 7&nbsp;August 1964 to Admiral Sharpe that \"Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonar men may have accounted for the many reports.\"<ref name=\"WorldNews\"/>\n\nOn 1 and 2 July 1966, the three torpedo boats from VPN Torpedo Squadron 135; ''T-333'', ''T-336'', and ''T-339'', which had attacked the USS ''Maddox'' on 2&nbsp;August 1964, came into the Tonkin Gulf again to attack two more US destroyers, only to be promptly sunk by US jets from the aircraft carriers {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}} and {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}}.<ref name=\"Moise, p. 195\">Moise, p. 195.</ref> Nineteen VPM sailors were taken as prisoner of war from those sunk torpedo boats, and they made it clear that no VPN torpedo boats had been sunk in 1964.<ref name=\"Moise, p. 195\"/> It could well have been that bad weather and freakish radar conditions for which the Gulf of Tonkin is famous, caused radar echoes to appear on ''Turner&nbsp;Joy''{{'}}s screen and prompted her captain and crew to take defensive action in consideration of the events two days earlier.<ref>Moise, pp. 106\u2013107.</ref>\n\nIn any event, the \"[[Tonkin Gulf Incident]]\" prompted American retaliation. ''Constellation'' joined ''Ticonderoga'' off North Vietnam the following day, and together they launched [[Operation Pierce Arrow]], sixty-four sorties against the bases from which the attacks had been launched and against an oil storage depot known to have been used to support those bases. Planes from ''Constellation'' hit the VPN bases at [[Hongay]] and [[Loc Chao]] in the north while ''Ticonderoga'' aircraft went after three targets in the south: the motor torpedo boat bases at [[Quang Khe]] and [[Phuc Loi]] as well as the [[Vinh]] oil storage depot. At the last-named target, American planes set fire to 12 of the 14&nbsp;oil storage tanks sending almost 10&nbsp;percent of North Vietnam's oil reserves up in smoke. Of more lasting significance both to the warship and the country, however, the incident prompted the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Tonkin Gulf Resolution]], the legal foundation for the United States to deploy conventional US military forces and directly confront North Vietnam in open warfare; which would ultimately involve the United States in a bloody and costly war in [[Indochina]] for the ensuing eight and a half years. Throughout that period, the ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' would serve repeatedly throughout the conflict.\n\n==Vietnam War operations==\nFollowing the excitement of the first week in August, the destroyer resumed more routine operations in the South China Sea. She concluded her deployment when she reached Long Beach on 2 October&mdash;two months to the day since she had rushed to the aid of ''Maddox''. The destroyer conducted normal operations out of Long Beach until 18 December when she entered the naval shipyard for a three-month overhaul. Late in March, she began refresher training out of San Diego. West coast operations occupied her until 10 July, when she departed Long Beach with DesRon 19, bound once again for duty in the Orient. At the end of a 21-day transit, Turner Joy joined {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}} near the end of the month. During August and the first three weeks of September, the destroyer served both as an escort for the carrier and as a detached radar picket ship.\n\nOn 23 September, she moved into the [[Gulf of Thailand]] near the west coast of [[South Vietnam]] to participate in one of the earliest naval gunfire support missions conducted along that section of the coastline. After a brief respite in [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] for upkeep, the warship returned to the ''gunline'' in October, this time along South Vietnam's southeastern coast between Cape St. Jacques and [[Chu Lai]]. On 25 September, she provided call-fire for American and South Vietnamese forces operating ashore in the vicinity of Chu Lai itself. During the mission, her guns destroyed a number of enemy positions and figured prominently in the repulse of a [[Viet Cong]] attack. Near the conclusion of that 24-hour action, a 5-inch round misfired; and, during the ensuing efforts to clear the chamber, the shell detonated. The explosion damaged the gun mount, killed three sailors, and wounded three more. That event forced her departure from the combat zone. After landing the three casualties at [[Da Nang]], ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' set course for Subic Bay in the Philippines. After a week of repairs, the destroyer departed Subic Bay in company with ''Ticonderoga'' for screening duty in the South China Sea, followed by port calls at [[Hong Kong]] and at Yokosuka, Japan. At the end of the year, she returned to naval gunfire support duty off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nOn 3 January 1966, the destroyer resumed plane guard duty with ''Ticonderoga'' in the South China Sea. The destroyer patrolled with the carrier on [[Yankee Station]] until 14 January when she headed, via Subic Bay, for Long Beach. ''Turner Joy'' arrived home on 1 February and, two weeks later, began a month-long restricted availability. From the completion of her overhaul in March through the end of May, the destroyer remained in Long Beach engaged in upkeep, repairs, and in training the numerous replacements who had reported on board. On 11 June, she put to sea once again to conduct a midshipman training cruise, during which she visited Pearl Harbor, [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], and [[San Francisco]]. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' concluded that operation on 29 July when she disembarked the midshipmen at Long Beach. Later that summer, she again visited Seattle in conjunction with that city's annual Seafair celebration. Additional training and upkeep at Long Beach followed and occupied her until the second week in October. At that time, she returned to sea to participate in fleet exercise \"Baseline II,\" after which she proceeded to Long Beach for a series of repairs in preparation for another tour of duty in the western Pacific. Turner Joy stood out of Long Beach on 18 November and&mdash;after visits to Pearl Harbor, [[Midway Islands|Midway]], and Guam&mdash;entered port at [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan, on 11 December.\n\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'''s fourth deployment to the western Pacific brought her three tours of duty off the coast of Vietnam and concluded with a visit to [[Australia]]. On 15 December, she departed Kaohsiung and headed for the coastline of the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] area of South Vietnam. The destroyer reached her zone of operations on the 18th and, for the next month, conducted shore bombardments in support of American and South Vietnamese troops operating ashore. She concluded that assignment on 17 January 1967 and headed for the Philippines. After two weeks of availability at Subic Bay and a five-day liberty visit to Hong Kong, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' returned to the Vietnamese coast on 10 February. For almost a month, she delivered gunfire support for troops ashore, this time in the I Corps zone of South Vietnam. That duty ended on 3 March, and a nine-day tender availability alongside {{USS|Jason|AR-8|6}} in [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]], Japan, followed.\n\nOn 21 March, the destroyer resumed station off Vietnam. This time, however, off the coast of North Vietnam. Instead of supporting American and South Vietnamese troops directly through shore bombardments, she did so by interdicting enemy logistical efforts in [[Operation Sea Dragon (Vietnam War)|Operation Sea Dragon]]. Though primarily directed at the enemy's water-borne logistics, \"Sea Dragon\" also struck wherever possible at the enemy's overland supply lines. During her 26 days on station engaged in \"Sea Dragon\" operations, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' fired on a number of shore targets in addition to an even larger number of enemy waterborne logistics craft. On 7 April, while firing on some enemy craft beached near Cap Mui Ron, the destroyer came under the fire of a North Vietnamese shore battery. During that exchange, she suffered a direct hit on the fantail and a near-miss air burst above the forward mast. The hit astern penetrated the deck to the supply office, damaging records therein as well as pipes and cables in the overhead. Several rounds of 5&nbsp;inch [[Proximity fuze#VT and \"Variable Time\"|VT]] fragmentation projectiles in mount 53 ammunition stowage area also suffered damage and had to be discarded. Shrapnel from near misses wounded a member of ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'''s repair party and peppered her bow while the air burst above the forward mast put her air-search radar out of service except for its IFF aspect. The damage, however, was not severe enough to curtail her tour of duty; and she remained on station until relieved by {{HMAS|Hobart|D39|6}} on 16 April.\n\nTwo days later, the destroyer arrived in Subic Bay, and she entered [[drydock]], soon thereafter, for repairs to her strut bearing, the bow, the peak tank, and her air search radar antenna. Concurrently with this yard work, she conducted a tender availability with {{USS|Piedmont|AD-17|6}} to prepare her for visits to Australia and New Zealand during the forthcoming celebration of the 25th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]]. Repairs and availability completed, she stood out of Subic Bay on 24 April in company with {{USS|McKean|DD-784|6}}. En route to [[Melbourne]], the two ships stopped at [[Manus Island]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]] and at [[Brisbane, Australia]]. The ship reached Melbourne on 8 May; and, while she remained there until the 13th, her crew enjoyed Australian hospitality in the city and replied in kind on board. Between 13 and 17 May, she made a rough transit of the [[Tasman Sea]] and arrived in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, on the latter date for the second phase of her [[Coral Sea]] celebration. She remained in Auckland until 22 May at which time she and ''McKean'' put to sea to return to the United States. After a stop at [[Pago Pago]], [[American Samoa]], the two ships rejoined {{USS|Gridley|DLG-21|6}} and ''Maddox'' on 26 May to reconstitute DesRon 19 for the voyage home. After a brief fueling stop at Pearl Harbor on 2 June, the warships arrived in Long Beach on 8  June. Between June and September, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' went through a month of post-deployment standdown followed by training operations in the waters off southern California. On 18 September, she arrived at [[Bremerton, Washington]], for a two-month shipyard availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In mid-November, she returned to Long Beach and resumed operations along the California coast.\n\nThat duty continued until late February 1968 when she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability in preparation for her fifth deployment to the Far East. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' stood out of Long Beach on 12 March and\u2014after stops at [[Oahu]], Midway, and Guam\u2014arrived in Subic Bay on 4 April. Over the following five months, the destroyer conducted operations along the coast of Vietnam similar to those performed during previous deployments. She delivered naval gunfire support for American and South Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam and conducted \"Sea Dragon\" patrols along the coast of North Vietnam to interdict enemy waterborne logistics traffic. Her tours of duty on the gunline took her to the [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I]], II and [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]] areas of South Vietnam. As during previous deployments, she punctuated assignments in the combat zone with visits to Subic Bay and to [[Buckner Bay]], [[Okinawa]], for fuel, supplies, and repairs, as well as to Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Hong Kong for rest and relaxation. She completed her last tour of duty of the deployment off the Vietnamese coast on 4 September and, after a brief tender availability at Subic Bay, headed homeward on 8 September. Retracing her outward-bound voyage with stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' entered Long Beach on 26 September.\n\nUpon her return to the United States, the warship began preparations for her regular overhaul. She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 28 November and remained there until late February 1969. When post-overhaul trials ended on 15 March, the ship resumed normal operations out of Long Beach. During April and May, she participated in a 1st Fleet combined ASW/AAW exercise as a part of her refresher training. She completed those operations during the latter half of May; and, after a. brief availability alongside {{USS|Bryce Canyon|AD-36|6}}, she embarked [[NROTC]] [[midshipman|midshipmen]] on 5 June for the two-month 1969 summer training cruise. At the end of the cruise, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' debarked the midshipmen on 1 August and resumed training in the southern California operating area.\n\nOn 18 November, she got underway from Long Beach to return to the Orient. Following a four-day layover at Pearl Harbor and brief fuel stops at Midway and Guam, she arrived in Subic Bay on 11 December. After a five-day availability alongside {{USS|Prairie|AD-15|6}}, the destroyer stood out of Subic Bay bound for Danang, South Vietnam, and gunfire support duty off the coast of the I Corps zone. By [[New Year's Day]] 1970, she was on her way to Yankee Station to act as plane guard for Task Force (TF) 77 aircraft carriers. On 4 January, she headed back to Subic Bay where she remained until the 18th. She completed another three-week tour on the gunline on 10 February and then shaped a course for Sasebo, Japan, whence she operated until early in March. After a liberty call in Hong Kong, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' returned to the Vietnamese coast and resumed gunfire support missions until early April. On 3 April, she rendezvoused with {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|6}} and then made port calls at Subic Bay and Bangkok, Thailand, before embarking upon her final gunline assignment on 19 April. She returned to Subic Bay on 10 May for a final visit before heading back to the United States on the 17th.\n\nThe destroyer arrived back in Long Beach on 1 June and began a three-month restricted availability in the naval shipyard. She completed the availability early in October and began sea trials and training in the southern California operating area. Early in December, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' reentered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to be readied for her redeployment to the western Pacific. On 26 January 1971, she stood out of Long Beach on her way to rejoin the 7th Fleet. She entered Subic Bay on 16 February and went into drydock for several days while both her propellers were replaced. On 5 March, she exited Subic Bay for a tour of naval gunfire support duty along the Vietnamese coast. That assignment&mdash;carried out along the I Corps-zone coastline near Danang&mdash;ended on 2 April; and she headed for Yankee Station and two weeks of plane guard duty with the TF&nbsp;77 aircraft carriers. Following a five-day port call at Subic Bay, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' took up position at Yankee Station again on 27 April&mdash;this time as escort for the PIRAZ (positive identification and radar advisory zone) ship. She performed that duty until 30 April; then, after three days evading a [[typhoon]], she moved in close to the I Corps shoreline to resume gunfire support duties.\n\nOn 14 May, the destroyer shaped a course for Subic Bay. Following a five-day gunfire exercise at the Tabones range, she departed the Philippines to make liberty visits to Bangkok, Thailand, and Hong Kong. In late June, she did another tour of duty on PIRAZ station and provided plane guard services to ''Kitty Hawk''. A brief liberty call at Subic Bay followed; and then, on 30 June, she embarked upon a voyage to Australia and New Zealand. During July, she made visits to the Australian towns of Brisbane and Sydney as well as Auckland, New Zealand. On 26 July ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' got underway for home. She arrived back in Long Beach on 10 August and conducted normal post-deployment evolutions through the remainder of 1971.\n\nIn February 1972, the destroyer began an extensive overhaul. Over the ensuing six months, she received entirely new 5&nbsp;inch 54-caliber gun mounts; and her propulsion plant underwent conversion to enable it to burn Navy distillate fuel. Extensive other modifications, installations, and renovations also took place between February and August. From August to December, she busied herself with various trials and tests at sea, conducted refresher training, and prepared for her next assignment to the Far East. Her voyage west began on 6 December and ended with her arrival at Subic Bay on the 29th. Two days later, she put to sea for her first tour on the gunline. It also proved to be her last. She delivered gunfire support for 28 days, \"delivering over 10,000 rounds of accurate fire in support of ground forces in South Vietnam and against enemy targets in North Vietnam\".<ref>USS ''Turner Joy'', Westpac 73 cruise book, Commanding Officer statement, p. 5</ref> \"USS ''Turner Joy'' fired the final round of naval gunfire of the war, hitting the beach at 000 GMT, 28 January 1973, scant seconds before the ceasefire went into effect\".<ref>USS ''Turner Joy'', Westpac 73 cruise book, p. 9</ref> Then, on 28 January 1973, American participation in the Vietnam War ended with a negotiated [[ceasefire]].\n\nFor the remainder of that deployment, ''Turner Joy'' participated in a variety of operations\u2014including [[Operation End Sweep]], the removal of American [[Naval mine|mine]]s from the waters around [[Haiphong]] harbor, as well as antisubmarine warfare exercises and carrier operations in the South China Sea. She punctuated those assignments with port visits to Subic Bay; Hong Kong; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Sasebo, Japan. On 13 June, she headed home via Yokosuka and arrived in Long Beach on 22 June. She spent the period from then until mid-October engaged in upkeep and a restricted availability. On 17 October, she departed Long Beach and set course for her new home port, San Diego. Upon arrival there, she began normal operations\u2014engineering and gunnery exercises at sea alternated with upkeep in port.\n\nThat routine continued until April 1974, at which time she began preparations for her first peacetime deployment to the western Pacific in a decade. She stood out of San Diego on 6 May, reached Pearl Harbor on the 12th, and completed a brief assignment with {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|6}} in the Hawaiian operating area on 24 May. On that day, she departed Oahu and continued her voyage west. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' arrived in Subic Bay on 4 June and, for the next two months, conducted local operations in company with ''Ranger''. On 1 August, the destroyer departed the Philippines for a goodwill visit to [[Surabaya]], [[Indonesia]]. She returned to the Philippines on 31 August and conducted local operations out of Subic Bay for two months before heading homeward on 3 October. The warship arrived in San Diego on 22 October and, after a month of post-deployment leave and upkeep, began a normal schedule of operations in the southern California operating area.\n\n==Post-Vietnam War operations==\n[[File:USSTurnerJoyBremerton.JPG|thumb|250px|left|''Turner Joy'', retired and docked in Bremerton, 2006.]]\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' ended 1974 and began 1975 engaged in a rather extensive availability which was completed in mid-April. At the conclusion of that repair period, she resumed operations along the coast of southern California. Refresher training, FleetEx 2-75, and a midshipman training cruise occupied her from April through August. On 2 September, she departed San Diego for the 11th deployment of her career to the western Pacific. However, after a two-week stop at Subic Bay, her western Pacific assignment was transformed into a tour of duty in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nOn 13 October, she departed Subic Bay in company with {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}, {{USS|Fanning|DE-1076|6}}, and {{USS|Sacramento|AOE-1|6}} bound ultimately for [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Iran]]. Along the way, she visited [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and participated in exercises with the [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Singaporean Navy]]. The destroyer arrived in Bandar Abbas on 13 November whence she and her sailing companions participated in the CENTO exercise, \"Midlink\". During that operation, she joined units of the [[Royal Navy|British]], Iranian, and [[Pakistan Navy|Pakistani]] navies in practicing a broad spectrum of naval tactics\u2014ASW, AAW, surface engagements, gunnery drills, and missile shoots.\n\n\"Midlink\" ended on 25 November, and ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' briefly stopped again at Bandar Abbas before heading for the Philippines on 29 November. She arrived back in Subic Bay on 12 December and remained there until 9 January 1976. Routine operations in the Philippines, exercises in the South China Sea and the Sea of Japan\u2014as well as visits to ports in Taiwan and Japan\u2014characterized the remainder of that deployment, which also included a harrowing cruise directly through the center of a typhoon. On 17 March, she stood out of Yokosuka to return to the United States. After stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, she reentered San Diego harbor on 4 April. Following post-deployment standdown, the destroyer reverted once more to training operations out of San Diego.\n\nOn 4 July 1976, the ''Turner Joy'' steamed up the [[San Joaquin River]] more than {{convert|50|mi}} from San Francisco Bay to participate in Stockton's Bicentennial celebrations, making her the first ship-of-the-line to visit that city.\n\nAs a result of long years of service in Vietnam and two delays in a scheduled overhaul, however, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' was unable to successfully complete her Operational Propulsion Plant Examination. This deficiency made it necessary for the ship to spend the remainder of 1976 in port correcting propulsion deficiencies.\n\nAfter an extended period in dry-dock at Long Beach. the ship went to San Diego mid-1979 for crewing to test the work done. After Engineering Quals were passed the ship was provisioned for a Westpac/South Pac goodwill cruise. The tour consists of going to Hawaii for more Quals in all departments. Then on to the Philippines for repairs on needed items. After 2 weeks there it went on to Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, & New Zealand. During this time the ship did sea trials with the Australia and New Zealand navies. Upon departing the ship stopped at Pago Pago on the way back to Hawaii before returning to the US. The ship arrived in San Diego in November 1980.\n\n==Fate==\nIn 1982, as the new [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyers]] joined the fleet, the Navy announced the retirement of ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' and her sister ships saying, \"...the cost of modernizing them is far greater than the benefits that could be derived from continued service.\"\n\n''Turner Joy'' was decommissioned 22 November 1982 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 13 February 1990. The [[Bremerton Historic Ships Association]] obtained ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' from the inactive fleet and after refurbishing her and constructing appropriate access to the ship, opened her to the public in 1992 in [[Bremerton, Washington]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Navy destroyers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Moise |first=Edwin, E. |title=Tonkin Gulf and the Escalation of the Vietnam War |year=1996 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0-8078-2300-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780807823002 }}\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/turner-joy.html}}\n*{{NVR|{{NVR url|id=DD951}}}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.ussturnerjoy.org/  USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy''] \u2013 official site\n*[http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/turner-joy.html history.navy.mil: USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n*[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/951.htm navsource.org: USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/destroy/dd951txt.htm hazegray.org: USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n*[http://hnsa.org/ships/turnerjoy.htm Historic Naval Ships Visitors Guide: ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n\n{{Forrest_Sherman_class_destroyer}}\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n{{1964 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{coord|47|33|50|N|122|37|19|W|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner Joy (DD-951)}}\n[[Category:Forrest Sherman-class destroyers]]\n[[Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Museums in Kitsap County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Bremerton, Washington]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company]]\n[[Category:1958 ships]]\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1964]]\n", "text_old": "{{other ships|USS Joy}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[File:USS Turner Joy (DD-951) underway at sea on 9 May 1964 (NH 98257).jpg|300px|USS Turner Joy (DD-951) underway at sea, 9 May 1964.]]\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide he\nder=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1981}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship namesake=[[C.

It was named for Admiral [[C. Turner Joy|Charles Turner Joy]] USN (1895&ndash;1956). Commissioned in 1959, it spent its entire career in the Pacific. It participated extensively in the [[Vietnam War]], and was one of the principal ships involved in the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]].\n\nDecommissioned in 1982, it is now a [[museum ship]] in Bremerton, Washington.\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' was built by the [[Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company]] of Seattle and commissioned at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]]. Her [[keel]] was laid on 30 September 1957. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 5 May 1958, sponsored by Mrs. C. Turner Joy, and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 August 1959.\n\n== Pre-Vietnam War operational duty ==\nFollowing a pre-shakedown goodwill cruise to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n ports and shakedown out of [[San Diego]], ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' began, early in 1960, duty as [[flagship]] both of Destroyer Squadron&nbsp;13 (DesRon&nbsp;13) and Destroyer Division&nbsp;131 (DesDiv&nbsp;131). Based at [[Long Beach, California]], she formed part of an [[antisubmarine warfare]] (ASW) task group built around {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}. She conducted exercises along the [[California]] coast until 17&nbsp;May 1960, when she sailed with the task group for the western [[Pacific]].\n\nAfter stops at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Apra, Guam]], she stood air-sea rescue duty near the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] for President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s flight to visit several [[Asia]]n nations. After returning to Apra briefly, the destroyer moved via the [[Philippines]] to [[Bangkok, Thailand]]. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' crossed the president's path once more in July&nbsp;1960, when the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] used the latter's visit to [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] as a pretext for [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis|shelling the islands]] of [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], once again. A tense month of duty with the [[Taiwan Strait]] patrol followed as the United States Navy demonstrated America's support for one of her allies. In mid-August&nbsp;1960, the warship moved north for exercises with [[U.S. 7th Fleet|7th&nbsp;Fleet]] carriers along the coast of [[Japan]]. That duty rounded out her first western Pacific deployment, and the destroyer got underway for [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], Japan, and headed home.\n\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' returned to Long Beach on 16 November 1960. Over the next 18&nbsp;months, she completed an extensive overhaul and participated in numerous 1st&nbsp;Fleet exercises along the California coast. In October&nbsp;1961, the destroyer was transferred to DesDiv&nbsp;191 of DesRon&nbsp;19 and assumed duty as flagship for both. On 2&nbsp;June 1962, she stood out of Long Beach with an ASW task group built around ''Hornet''. On her way to the [[Far East]], the warship participated in exercises with Amphibious Squadron&nbsp;5 in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Later, she joined the screen of {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}}, operating off the southern coast of [[Honsh\u016b]], Japan.\n\nHer second deployment to the Orient was characterized by a series of exercises with ships of the 7th Fleet and of allied navies. Areas of operations included the [[Sea of Japan]], the Pacific east of Japan, and the [[South China Sea]]. After a final series of drills conducted with {{USS|Bon Homme Richard|CV-31|6}}, the destroyer completed that tour of duty at Yokosuka, Japan, early in December. On 7&nbsp;June, she headed back to the United States where she arrived on 21&nbsp;June. The ensuing 14&nbsp;months brought another overhaul as well as further [[U.S. 1st Fleet|1st&nbsp;Fleet]] exercises in the waters along the west coast. Those evolutions continued into 1964; and, in March, the destroyer began preparations for overseas movement.\n\n==Gulf of Tonkin Incident==\n{{main|Gulf of Tonkin Incident}}\nOn 13 March 1964, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' departed Long Beach to embark upon her most celebrated tour of duty in the Far East. The third western Pacific deployment of her career began routinely enough. After calling at Pearl Harbor on her way west, the destroyer joined a task group built around {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} for operations in the [[Philippine Sea]], followed by a cruise through the South China Sea to Japan. Further training operations and port visits ensued, as the deployment continued peacefully. During late July&nbsp;1964, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'', while attached to a carrier task group built around {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, began making \"watch dog\" patrols off the coast of [[Vietnam]] where a [[guerrilla war]] had been raging at varying levels of intensity since the end of [[World War II]].\n\nIn the afternoon of 2&nbsp;August 1964, {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}}, engaged in a [[DESOTO patrol]], called for assistance when three [[Vietnam People's Navy]] (VPN) [[P 4-class torpedo boat]]s from the 135th&nbsp;Torpedo Squadron attacked her.<ref>Moise, p. 78.</ref> As ''Maddox'' engaged the boats, firing over 280&nbsp;five-inch shells, the contact was broken, and each combatant withdrew from the contact. While retreating to the North Vietnamese coastline, the three torpedo boats were attacked by four Navy [[F-8 Crusader]] jets from ''Ticonderoga'' which fired rockets and strafed with [[20mm]] cannon fire, damaging two torpedo boats and leaving one boat in apparently sinking condition.<ref>Moise, pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Meanwhile, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' raced to ''Maddox'' to provide additional surface strength. By the time she reached ''Maddox'', the torpedo boats were no longer in the area.\n\nOn 3 August 1964, the ''Turner Joy'' was ordered to accompany the ''Maddox'' for another DESOTO mission,<ref>Moise, p. 94.</ref> on 4&nbsp;August ''Turner&nbsp;Joy''{{'}}s radar screens picked up a number of what appeared to be small, high-speed surface craft approaching, but at extreme range. As a precaution, the two destroyers called upon ''Ticonderoga'' to furnish air support. By nightfall, the unidentified radar echoes suggested that VPN torpedo boats were converging upon the two American warships from the west and south. ''Turner Joy'' reported that she sighted one or two torpedo wakes, then rang up full speed, maneuvered radically to evade expected torpedoes, and began firing in the direction of the unidentified blips.<ref>Moise, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> Over the next two and a half hours, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' fired approximately 220&nbsp;five-inch shells, while planes from ''Ticonderoga'' fired at the supposed torpedo boats.<ref>Moise, p. 160.</ref>\n\nReports claimed that at least two of those were sunk by direct hits and another pair severely damaged, and that the remaining boats retired rapidly to the north.  A sailor in the Gun Director on the USS ''Maddox'', Patrick Park, reviewed radar and sonar records for the next three days after the incident on orders from his superiors.  His conclusion, there were no attacks on 4 August 1964 against the ''Maddox'' and the ''Turner Joy''.<ref name=\"WorldNews\">{{cite web |url= http://wn.com/tonkin_gulf_incident |title=Tonkin Gulf Incident |work=[[World News Network]] |year=2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> This has been supported by evidence from the Vietnamese since the end of hostilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html |title=McNamara asks Giap: What happened in Tonkin Gulf? |work=Associated Press |year=1999 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306124920/http://vi.uh.edu/pages/buzzmat/world198_4.html |archivedate=6 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, Admiral Moore reported on 7&nbsp;August 1964 to Admiral Sharpe that \"Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonar men may have accounted for the many reports.\"<ref name=\"WorldNews\"/>\n\nOn 1 and 2 July 1966, the three torpedo boats from VPN Torpedo Squadron 135; ''T-333'', ''T-336'', and ''T-339'', which had attacked the USS ''Maddox'' on 2&nbsp;August 1964, came into the Tonkin Gulf again to attack two more US destroyers, only to be promptly sunk by US jets from the aircraft carriers {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}} and {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}}.<ref name=\"Moise, p. 195\">Moise, p. 195.</ref> Nineteen VPM sailors were taken as prisoner of war from those sunk torpedo boats, and they made it clear that no VPN torpedo boats had been sunk in 1964.<ref name=\"Moise, p. 195\"/> It could well have been that bad weather and freakish radar conditions for which the Gulf of Tonkin is famous, caused radar echoes to appear on ''Turner&nbsp;Joy''{{'}}s screen and prompted her captain and crew to take defensive action in consideration of the events two days earlier.<ref>Moise, pp. 106\u2013107.</ref>\n\nIn any event, the \"[[Tonkin Gulf Incident]]\" prompted American retaliation. ''Constellation'' joined ''Ticonderoga'' off North Vietnam the following day, and together they launched [[Operation Pierce Arrow]], sixty-four sorties against the bases from which the attacks had been launched and against an oil storage depot known to have been used to support those bases. Planes from ''Constellation'' hit the VPN bases at [[Hongay]] and [[Loc Chao]] in the north while ''Ticonderoga'' aircraft went after three targets in the south: the motor torpedo boat bases at [[Quang Khe]] and [[Phuc Loi]] as well as the [[Vinh]] oil storage depot. At the last-named target, American planes set fire to 12 of the 14&nbsp;oil storage tanks sending almost 10&nbsp;percent of North Vietnam's oil reserves up in smoke. Of more lasting significance both to the warship and the country, however, the incident prompted the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Tonkin Gulf Resolution]], the legal foundation for the United States to deploy conventional US military forces and directly confront North Vietnam in open warfare; which would ultimately involve the United States in a bloody and costly war in [[Indochina]] for the ensuing eight and a half years. Throughout that period, the ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' would serve repeatedly throughout the conflict.\n\n==Vietnam War operations==\nFollowing the excitement of the first week in August, the destroyer resumed more routine operations in the South China Sea. She concluded her deployment when she reached Long Beach on 2 October&mdash;two months to the day since she had rushed to the aid of ''Maddox''. The destroyer conducted normal operations out of Long Beach until 18 December when she entered the naval shipyard for a three-month overhaul. Late in March, she began refresher training out of San Diego. West coast operations occupied her until 10 July, when she departed Long Beach with DesRon 19, bound once again for duty in the Orient. At the end of a 21-day transit, Turner Joy joined {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}} near the end of the month. During August and the first three weeks of September, the destroyer served both as an escort for the carrier and as a detached radar picket ship.\n\nOn 23 September, she moved into the [[Gulf of Thailand]] near the west coast of [[South Vietnam]] to participate in one of the earliest naval gunfire support missions conducted along that section of the coastline. After a brief respite in [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] for upkeep, the warship returned to the ''gunline'' in October, this time along South Vietnam's southeastern coast between Cape St. Jacques and [[Chu Lai]]. On 25 September, she provided call-fire for American and South Vietnamese forces operating ashore in the vicinity of Chu Lai itself. During the mission, her guns destroyed a number of enemy positions and figured prominently in the repulse of a [[Viet Cong]] attack. Near the conclusion of that 24-hour action, a 5-inch round misfired; and, during the ensuing efforts to clear the chamber, the shell detonated. The explosion damaged the gun mount, killed three sailors, and wounded three more. That event forced her departure from the combat zone. After landing the three casualties at [[Da Nang]], ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' set course for Subic Bay in the Philippines. After a week of repairs, the destroyer departed Subic Bay in company with ''Ticonderoga'' for screening duty in the South China Sea, followed by port calls at [[Hong Kong]] and at Yokosuka, Japan. At the end of the year, she returned to naval gunfire support duty off the coast of South Vietnam.\n\nOn 3 January 1966, the destroyer resumed plane guard duty with ''Ticonderoga'' in the South China Sea. The destroyer patrolled with the carrier on [[Yankee Station]] until 14 January when she headed, via Subic Bay, for Long Beach. ''Turner Joy'' arrived home on 1 February and, two weeks later, began a month-long restricted availability. From the completion of her overhaul in March through the end of May, the destroyer remained in Long Beach engaged in upkeep, repairs, and in training the numerous replacements who had reported on board. On 11 June, she put to sea once again to conduct a midshipman training cruise, during which she visited Pearl Harbor, [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], and [[San Francisco]]. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' concluded that operation on 29 July when she disembarked the midshipmen at Long Beach. Later that summer, she again visited Seattle in conjunction with that city's annual Seafair celebration. Additional training and upkeep at Long Beach followed and occupied her until the second week in October. At that time, she returned to sea to participate in fleet exercise \"Baseline II,\" after which she proceeded to Long Beach for a series of repairs in preparation for another tour of duty in the western Pacific. Turner Joy stood out of Long Beach on 18 November and&mdash;after visits to Pearl Harbor, [[Midway Islands|Midway]], and Guam&mdash;entered port at [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan, on 11 December.\n\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'''s fourth deployment to the western Pacific brought her three tours of duty off the coast of Vietnam and concluded with a visit to [[Australia]]. On 15 December, she departed Kaohsiung and headed for the coastline of the [[II Corps (South Vietnam)|II Corps]] area of South Vietnam. The destroyer reached her zone of operations on the 18th and, for the next month, conducted shore bombardments in support of American and South Vietnamese troops operating ashore. She concluded that assignment on 17 January 1967 and headed for the Philippines. After two weeks of availability at Subic Bay and a five-day liberty visit to Hong Kong, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' returned to the Vietnamese coast on 10 February. For almost a month, she delivered gunfire support for troops ashore, this time in the I Corps zone of South Vietnam. That duty ended on 3 March, and a nine-day tender availability alongside {{USS|Jason|AR-8|6}} in [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]], Japan, followed.\n\nOn 21 March, the destroyer resumed station off Vietnam. This time, however, off the coast of North Vietnam. Instead of supporting American and South Vietnamese troops directly through shore bombardments, she did so by interdicting enemy logistical efforts in [[Operation Sea Dragon (Vietnam War)|Operation Sea Dragon]]. Though primarily directed at the enemy's water-borne logistics, \"Sea Dragon\" also struck wherever possible at the enemy's overland supply lines. During her 26 days on station engaged in \"Sea Dragon\" operations, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' fired on a number of shore targets in addition to an even larger number of enemy waterborne logistics craft. On 7 April, while firing on some enemy craft beached near Cap Mui Ron, the destroyer came under the fire of a North Vietnamese shore battery. During that exchange, she suffered a direct hit on the fantail and a near-miss air burst above the forward mast. The hit astern penetrated the deck to the supply office, damaging records therein as well as pipes and cables in the overhead. Several rounds of 5&nbsp;inch [[Proximity fuze#VT and \"Variable Time\"|VT]] fragmentation projectiles in mount 53 ammunition stowage area also suffered damage and had to be discarded. Shrapnel from near misses wounded a member of ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'''s repair party and peppered her bow while the air burst above the forward mast put her air-search radar out of service except for its IFF aspect. The damage, however, was not severe enough to curtail her tour of duty; and she remained on station until relieved by {{HMAS|Hobart|D39|6}} on 16 April.\n\nTwo days later, the destroyer arrived in Subic Bay, and she entered [[drydock]], soon thereafter, for repairs to her strut bearing, the bow, the peak tank, and her air search radar antenna. Concurrently with this yard work, she conducted a tender availability with {{USS|Piedmont|AD-17|6}} to prepare her for visits to Australia and New Zealand during the forthcoming celebration of the 25th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]]. Repairs and availability completed, she stood out of Subic Bay on 24 April in company with {{USS|McKean|DD-784|6}}. En route to [[Melbourne]], the two ships stopped at [[Manus Island]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]] and at [[Brisbane, Australia]]. The ship reached Melbourne on 8 May; and, while she remained there until the 13th, her crew enjoyed Australian hospitality in the city and replied in kind on board. Between 13 and 17 May, she made a rough transit of the [[Tasman Sea]] and arrived in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, on the latter date for the second phase of her [[Coral Sea]] celebration. She remained in Auckland until 22 May at which time she and ''McKean'' put to sea to return to the United States. After a stop at [[Pago Pago]], [[American Samoa]], the two ships rejoined {{USS|Gridley|DLG-21|6}} and ''Maddox'' on 26 May to reconstitute DesRon 19 for the voyage home. After a brief fueling stop at Pearl Harbor on 2 June, the warships arrived in Long Beach on 8  June. Between June and September, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' went through a month of post-deployment standdown followed by training operations in the waters off southern California. On 18 September, she arrived at [[Bremerton, Washington]], for a two-month shipyard availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In mid-November, she returned to Long Beach and resumed operations along the California coast.\n\nThat duty continued until late February 1968 when she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability in preparation for her fifth deployment to the Far East. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' stood out of Long Beach on 12 March and\u2014after stops at [[Oahu]], Midway, and Guam\u2014arrived in Subic Bay on 4 April. Over the following five months, the destroyer conducted operations along the coast of Vietnam similar to those performed during previous deployments. She delivered naval gunfire support for American and South Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam and conducted \"Sea Dragon\" patrols along the coast of North Vietnam to interdict enemy waterborne logistics traffic. Her tours of duty on the gunline took her to the [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I]], II and [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]] areas of South Vietnam. As during previous deployments, she punctuated assignments in the combat zone with visits to Subic Bay and to [[Buckner Bay]], [[Okinawa]], for fuel, supplies, and repairs, as well as to Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Hong Kong for rest and relaxation. She completed her last tour of duty of the deployment off the Vietnamese coast on 4 September and, after a brief tender availability at Subic Bay, headed homeward on 8 September. Retracing her outward-bound voyage with stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' entered Long Beach on 26 September.\n\nUpon her return to the United States, the warship began preparations for her regular overhaul. She entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 28 November and remained there until late February 1969. When post-overhaul trials ended on 15 March, the ship resumed normal operations out of Long Beach. During April and May, she participated in a 1st Fleet combined ASW/AAW exercise as a part of her refresher training. She completed those operations during the latter half of May; and, after a. brief availability alongside {{USS|Bryce Canyon|AD-36|6}}, she embarked [[NROTC]] [[midshipman|midshipmen]] on 5 June for the two-month 1969 summer training cruise. At the end of the cruise, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' debarked the midshipmen on 1 August and resumed training in the southern California operating area.\n\nOn 18 November, she got underway from Long Beach to return to the Orient. Following a four-day layover at Pearl Harbor and brief fuel stops at Midway and Guam, she arrived in Subic Bay on 11 December. After a five-day availability alongside {{USS|Prairie|AD-15|6}}, the destroyer stood out of Subic Bay bound for Danang, South Vietnam, and gunfire support duty off the coast of the I Corps zone. By [[New Year's Day]] 1970, she was on her way to Yankee Station to act as plane guard for Task Force (TF) 77 aircraft carriers. On 4 January, she headed back to Subic Bay where she remained until the 18th. She completed another three-week tour on the gunline on 10 February and then shaped a course for Sasebo, Japan, whence she operated until early in March. After a liberty call in Hong Kong, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' returned to the Vietnamese coast and resumed gunfire support missions until early April. On 3 April, she rendezvoused with {{USS|Shangri-La|CV-38|6}} and then made port calls at Subic Bay and Bangkok, Thailand, before embarking upon her final gunline assignment on 19 April. She returned to Subic Bay on 10 May for a final visit before heading back to the United States on the 17th.\n\nThe destroyer arrived back in Long Beach on 1 June and began a three-month restricted availability in the naval shipyard. She completed the availability early in October and began sea trials and training in the southern California operating area. Early in December, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' reentered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to be readied for her redeployment to the western Pacific. On 26 January 1971, she stood out of Long Beach on her way to rejoin the 7th Fleet. She entered Subic Bay on 16 February and went into drydock for several days while both her propellers were replaced. On 5 March, she exited Subic Bay for a tour of naval gunfire support duty along the Vietnamese coast. That assignment&mdash;carried out along the I Corps-zone coastline near Danang&mdash;ended on 2 April; and she headed for Yankee Station and two weeks of plane guard duty with the TF&nbsp;77 aircraft carriers. Following a five-day port call at Subic Bay, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' took up position at Yankee Station again on 27 April&mdash;this time as escort for the PIRAZ (positive identification and radar advisory zone) ship. She performed that duty until 30 April; then, after three days evading a [[typhoon]], she moved in close to the I Corps shoreline to resume gunfire support duties.\n\nOn 14 May, the destroyer shaped a course for Subic Bay. Following a five-day gunfire exercise at the Tabones range, she departed the Philippines to make liberty visits to Bangkok, Thailand, and Hong Kong. In late June, she did another tour of duty on PIRAZ station and provided plane guard services to ''Kitty Hawk''. A brief liberty call at Subic Bay followed; and then, on 30 June, she embarked upon a voyage to Australia and New Zealand. During July, she made visits to the Australian towns of Brisbane and Sydney as well as Auckland, New Zealand. On 26 July ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' got underway for home. She arrived back in Long Beach on 10 August and conducted normal post-deployment evolutions through the remainder of 1971.\n\nIn February 1972, the destroyer began an extensive overhaul. Over the ensuing six months, she received entirely new 5&nbsp;inch 54-caliber gun mounts; and her propulsion plant underwent conversion to enable it to burn Navy distillate fuel. Extensive other modifications, installations, and renovations also took place between February and August. From August to December, she busied herself with various trials and tests at sea, conducted refresher training, and prepared for her next assignment to the Far East. Her voyage west began on 6 December and ended with her arrival at Subic Bay on the 29th. Two days later, she put to sea for her first tour on the gunline. It also proved to be her last. She delivered gunfire support for 28 days, \"delivering over 10,000 rounds of accurate fire in support of ground forces in South Vietnam and against enemy targets in North Vietnam\".<ref>USS ''Turner Joy'', Westpac 73 cruise book, Commanding Officer statement, p. 5</ref> \"USS ''Turner Joy'' fired the final round of naval gunfire of the war, hitting the beach at 000 GMT, 28 January 1973, scant seconds before the ceasefire went into effect\".<ref>USS ''Turner Joy'', Westpac 73 cruise book, p. 9</ref> Then, on 28 January 1973, American participation in the Vietnam War ended with a negotiated [[ceasefire]].\n\nFor the remainder of that deployment, ''Turner Joy'' participated in a variety of operations\u2014including [[Operation End Sweep]], the removal of American [[Naval mine|mine]]s from the waters around [[Haiphong]] harbor, as well as antisubmarine warfare exercises and carrier operations in the South China Sea. She punctuated those assignments with port visits to Subic Bay; Hong Kong; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Sasebo, Japan. On 13 June, she headed home via Yokosuka and arrived in Long Beach on 22 June. She spent the period from then until mid-October engaged in upkeep and a restricted availability. On 17 October, she departed Long Beach and set course for her new home port, San Diego. Upon arrival there, she began normal operations\u2014engineering and gunnery exercises at sea alternated with upkeep in port.\n\nThat routine continued until April 1974, at which time she began preparations for her first peacetime deployment to the western Pacific in a decade. She stood out of San Diego on 6 May, reached Pearl Harbor on the 12th, and completed a brief assignment with {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|6}} in the Hawaiian operating area on 24 May. On that day, she departed Oahu and continued her voyage west. ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' arrived in Subic Bay on 4 June and, for the next two months, conducted local operations in company with ''Ranger''. On 1 August, the destroyer departed the Philippines for a goodwill visit to [[Surabaya]], [[Indonesia]]. She returned to the Philippines on 31 August and conducted local operations out of Subic Bay for two months before heading homeward on 3 October. The warship arrived in San Diego on 22 October and, after a month of post-deployment leave and upkeep, began a normal schedule of operations in the southern California operating area.\n\n==Post-Vietnam War operations==\n[[File:USSTurnerJoyBremerton.JPG|thumb|250px|left|''Turner Joy'', retired and docked in Bremerton, 2006.]]\n''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' ended 1974 and began 1975 engaged in a rather extensive availability which was completed in mid-April. At the conclusion of that repair period, she resumed operations along the coast of southern California. Refresher training, FleetEx 2-75, and a midshipman training cruise occupied her from April through August. On 2 September, she departed San Diego for the 11th deployment of her career to the western Pacific. However, after a two-week stop at Subic Bay, her western Pacific assignment was transformed into a tour of duty in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nOn 13 October, she departed Subic Bay in company with {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}, {{USS|Fanning|DE-1076|6}}, and {{USS|Sacramento|AOE-1|6}} bound ultimately for [[Bandar Abbas]], [[Iran]]. Along the way, she visited [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]] and participated in exercises with the [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Singaporean Navy]]. The destroyer arrived in Bandar Abbas on 13 November whence she and her sailing companions participated in the CENTO exercise, \"Midlink\". During that operation, she joined units of the [[Royal Navy|British]], Iranian, and [[Pakistan Navy|Pakistani]] navies in practicing a broad spectrum of naval tactics\u2014ASW, AAW, surface engagements, gunnery drills, and missile shoots.\n\n\"Midlink\" ended on 25 November, and ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' briefly stopped again at Bandar Abbas before heading for the Philippines on 29 November. She arrived back in Subic Bay on 12 December and remained there until 9 January 1976. Routine operations in the Philippines, exercises in the South China Sea and the Sea of Japan\u2014as well as visits to ports in Taiwan and Japan\u2014characterized the remainder of that deployment, which also included a harrowing cruise directly through the center of a typhoon. On 17 March, she stood out of Yokosuka to return to the United States. After stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, she reentered San Diego harbor on 4 April. Following post-deployment standdown, the destroyer reverted once more to training operations out of San Diego.\n\nOn 4 July 1976, the ''Turner Joy'' steamed up the [[San Joaquin River]] more than {{convert|50|mi}} from San Francisco Bay to participate in Stockton's Bicentennial celebrations, making her the first ship-of-the-line to visit that city.\n\nAs a result of long years of service in Vietnam and two delays in a scheduled overhaul, however, ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' was unable to successfully complete her Operational Propulsion Plant Examination. This deficiency made it necessary for the ship to spend the remainder of 1976 in port correcting propulsion deficiencies.\n\nAfter an extended period in dry-dock at Long Beach. the ship went to San Diego mid-1979 for crewing to test the work done. After Engineering Quals were passed the ship was provisioned for a Westpac/South Pac goodwill cruise. The tour consists of going to Hawaii for more Quals in all departments. Then on to the Philippines for repairs on needed items. After 2 weeks there it went on to Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, & New Zealand. During this time the ship did sea trials with the Australia and New Zealand navies. Upon departing the ship stopped at Pago Pago on the way back to Hawaii before returning to the US. The ship arrived in San Diego in November 1980.\n\n==Fate==\nIn 1982, as the new [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyers]] joined the fleet, the Navy announced the retirement of ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' and her sister ships saying, \"...the cost of modernizing them is far greater than the benefits that could be derived from continued service.\"\n\n''Turner Joy'' was decommissioned 22 November 1982 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 13 February 1990. The [[Bremerton Historic Ships Association]] obtained ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'' from the inactive fleet and after refurbishing her and constructing appropriate access to the ship, opened her to the public in 1992 in [[Bremerton, Washington]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Navy destroyers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Moise |first=Edwin, E. |title=Tonkin Gulf and the Escalation of the Vietnam War |year=1996 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0-8078-2300-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780807823002 }}\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/turner-joy.html}}\n*{{NVR|{{NVR url|id=DD951}}}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.ussturnerjoy.org/  USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy''] \u2013 official site\n*[http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/turner-joy.html history.navy.mil: USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n*[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/951.htm navsource.org: USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/destroy/dd951txt.htm hazegray.org: USS ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n*[http://hnsa.org/ships/turnerjoy.htm Historic Naval Ships Visitors Guide: ''Turner&nbsp;Joy'']\n\n{{Forrest_Sherman_class_destroyer}}\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n{{1964 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{coord|47|33|50|N|122|37|19|W|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner Joy (DD-951)}}\n[[Category:Forrest Sherman-class destroyers]]\n[[Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Museums in Kitsap County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Bremerton, Washington]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company]]\n[[Category:1958 ships]]\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1964]]\n", "name_user": "78.147.177.222", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eConstruction and commissioning)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Turner_Joy"}
{"title_page": "Shubin (ghost)", "text_new": "'''Shubin''' is the mythological [[Ghost|spirit]] of the [[Mining|mines]]. The legend of Shubin is distributed mainly in the mining towns of [[Donbass]], region of [[Ukraine]]. In the north one can hear several legends about the spirit of the mines. The spirit is usually good, but can be wicked. There is no single point of view about the etymology of the word. Explanations include: (1) the nickname of a miner, whose soul, according to legend, walks in a fur coat at the bottom of the mine with a torch in his hand and burns the gas ([[firedamp]]); (2) the name of the cruel mining master Shubin, who slew workers underground; (3) the sound from [[methane]] (Shu-Shu), which often accumulates in the mines.\n\n==Shubin in Ukraine==\n[[File:Antishubin Lugansk.jpg|thumb|250px|The Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Luhansk Oblast]] Ioanniky [[Exorcism|casts out demons]] from the mine]]\n\n===Legends about good Shubin===\nAccording to one version, Shubin is the ghost of a dead miner. Another is that he was a mining master who worked in the late 19th century on one of the mines in the [[Donbass]]. He had a gift for predicting collapses and [[methane]] emissions. Therefore, before each shift, the master would go down in the mine and, if he felt something was wrong, he warned of the danger. Hence, the name coal miners called the spirit that comes to them to help in a dangerous hour. \n\nIn the mining towns, many stories go, people have seen this spirit with their own eyes. Once, when a man was in the mine, the lights went down. \nHe was in complete darkness, lost his orientation, and could not find the exit. He fell into despair but suddenly he saw lights far away. The spirit drew near, holding a flashing [[beacon]]. The man was afraid, but obediently followed until he was removed from the labyrinth of darkness. \nSome miners say that Shubin can be good or bad, depending on which person he meets.\n\n===Legends of evil Shubin===\nNot all legends about Shubin depict him as the embodiment of good forces. [[Anthracite]] miners of the area claim that this ghost is  vindictive and often plagues them with accidents in the mines.\n\nThere is a legend that once, long ago somewhere in [[Donbass]], a man came in search of a better life. He visited the [[tavern]] to request help in finding a job. Drunken miners said they would give him a test. The newcomer would have to go down the mine, light a torch, and walk a few meters. If he was not afraid, he could become a miner. A man did not guess the true purpose of this test. In fact, the miners wanted to determine whether there was methane in the mine, which always gave them a lot of trouble. If the gas exploded, it would save the lives of other miners who were due  to work the next day. The drunken miners cynically thought it was better for a beginner to take the risk. At a certain concentration the gas (firedamp or methane) burned but did not explode. In such a case, a fur coat gave the miner some protection from skin burns. That's why the newcomer put a fur coat on. Then he did what he was ordered but, unfortunately, there was an explosion.\n\nSince then, a man's spirit has haunted the mines, taking vengeance for the wrong that was done to him. Sometimes it is voracious and causes terrible accidents that take the lives of dozens of miners. [[Exorcism|To cast the evil spirit]] from the [[Lugansk]] mines, Metropolitan Ioanniky <!-- see talk page --> specially descended into a shaft in the [[Sverdlovsk, Ukraine|Sverdlovsk]] region and said [[prayer]]s there.\n\n==Shubin in Russia==\nShubin is known in [[Russia]]. There, in some areas you can even hear the phrase \"\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0448\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\". This means that a man got into a very dangerous and desperate situation. They say that in the [[Urals]] in the 19th century lived a cruel master named Shubin, who slew people working underground. For this he was killed. Since then he haunts underground drains and is usually displayed in the image of a stooped old man in a fur coat and with pitted felt boots. They say that those who see Shubin are unlikely to remain alive.\n\n==Popularity of Shubin in Donbass==\nThe popularity of legends about Shubin has led to his name being used in the Donbass region in entertainment, bars and a popular brand of [[beer]] Good Shubin from [[Donetsk]] brewery [[Beer in Ukraine|Sarmat]].\n\n==Similar spirits==\n* [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ''Bila Koroleva'' (White Queen). In the beliefs of some miners the Shubin spirit appears as a [[female]]. Once, a miner from [[Sverdlovsk, Ukraine|Sverdlovsk]] region went missing. After a long search he was finally found in the mine naked. He went mad and was taken to a [[mental hospital]]. Then some other miners went mad. All of them told about the \"white queen\", a beautiful woman who tried to cheat them, but the miners could not bear her towering beauty and completely lost their reason. People have long mocked these stories and passed by the mental hospital where the miners were treated and said that it was the home of the white kings. Since the white queen have disappeared from the mine but no one can tell exactly when she would come again.\n* Polish ''Skarbnik'' (Treasurer) which inhabits the [[Wieliczka]] salt mines\n* Gothic [[Kobold]] - a spirit guardian of underground mines and jewelry\n\n==Literature==\n* ''O.''Forostyuk.

Explanations include: (1) the nickname of a miner, whose soul, according to legend, walks in a fur coat at the bottom of the mine with a torch in his hand and burns the gas ([[firedamp]]); (2) the name of the cruel mining master Shubin, who slew workers underground; (3) the sound from [[methane]] (Shu-Shu), which often accumulates in the mines.\n\n==Shubin in Ukraine==\n[[File:Antishubin Lugansk.jpg|thumb|250px|The Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Luhansk Oblast]] Ioanniky [[Exorcism|casts out demons]] from the mine]]\n\n===Legends about good Shubin===\nAccording to one version, Shubin is the ghost of a dead miner. Another is that he was a mining master who worked in the late 19th century on one of the mines in the [[Donbass]]. He had a gift for predicting collapses and [[methane]] emissions. Therefore, before each shift, the master would go down in the mine and, if he felt something was wrong, he warned of the danger. Hence, the name coal miners called the spirit that comes to them to help in a dangerous hour. \n\nIn the mining towns, many stories go, people have seen this spirit with their own eyes. Once, when a man was in the mine, the lights went down. \nHe was in complete darkness, lost his orientation, and could not find the exit. He fell into despair but suddenly he saw lights far away. The spirit drew near, holding a flashing [[beacon]]. The man was afraid, but obediently followed until he was removed from the labyrinth of darkness. \nSome miners say that Shubin can be good or bad, depending on which person he meets.\n\n===Legends of evil Shubin===\nNot all legends about Shubin depict him as the embodiment of good forces. [[Anthracite]] miners of the area claim that this ghost is  vindictive and often plagues them with accidents in the mines.\n\nThere is a legend that once, long ago somewhere in [[Donbass]], a man came in search of a better life. He visited the [[tavern]] to request help in finding a job. Drunken miners said they would give him a test. The newcomer would have to go down the mine, light a torch, and walk a few meters. If he was not afraid, he could become a miner. A man did not guess the true purpose of this test. In fact, the miners wanted to determine whether there was methane in the mine, which always gave them a lot of trouble. If the gas exploded, it would save the lives of other miners who were due  to work the next day. The drunken miners cynically thought it was better for a beginner to take the risk. At a certain concentration the gas (firedamp or methane) burned but did not explode. In such a case, a fur coat gave the miner some protection from skin burns. That's why the newcomer put a fur coat on. Then he did what he was ordered but, unfortunately, there was an explosion.\n\nSince then, a man's spirit has haunted the mines, taking vengeance for the wrong that was done to him. Sometimes it is voracious and causes terrible accidents that take the lives of dozens of miners. [[Exorcism|To cast the evil spirit]] from the [[Lugansk]] mines, Metropolitan Ioanniky <!-- see talk page --> specially descended into a shaft in the [[Sverdlovsk, Ukraine|Sverdlovsk]] region and said [[prayer]]s there.\n\n==Shubin in Russia==\nShubin is known in [[Russia]]. There, in some areas you can even hear the phrase \"\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0448\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\". This means that a man got into a very dangerous and desperate situation. They say that in the [[Urals]] in the 19th century lived a cruel master named Shubin, who slew people working underground. For this he was killed. Since then he haunts underground drains and is usually displayed in the image of a stooped old man in a fur coat and with pitted felt boots. They say that those who see Shubin are unlikely to remain alive.\n\n==Popularity of Shubin in Donbass==\nThe popularity of legends about Shubin has led to his name being used in the Donbass region in entertainment, bars and a popular brand of [[beer]] Good Shubin from [[Donetsk]] brewery [[Beer in Ukraine|Sarmat]].\n\n==Similar spirits==\n* [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ''Bila Koroleva'' (White Queen). In the beliefs of some miners the Shubin spirit appears as a [[female]]. Once, a miner from [[Sverdlovsk, Ukraine|Sverdlovsk]] region went missing. After a long search he was finally found in the mine naked. He went mad and was taken to a [[mental hospital]]. Then some other miners went mad. All of them told about the \"white queen\", a beautiful woman who tried to cheat them, but the miners could not bear her towering beauty and completely lost their reason. People have long mocked these stories and passed by the mental hospital where the miners were treated and said that it was the home of the white kings. Since the white queen have disappeared from the mine but no one can tell exactly when she would come again.\n* Polish ''Skarbnik'' (Treasurer) which inhabits the [[Wieliczka]] salt mines\n* Gothic [[Kobold]] - a spirit guardian of underground mines and jewelry\n\n==Literature==\n* ''O.''Forostyuk.

Greg was the long-lost son of [[Les Battersby-Brown|Les Battersby]] and is best known for his ultimately abusive relationship with [[Sally Webster]].\n\nGreg was the result of a holiday romance between Moira Kelly and Les Battersby when he was working on a travelling fairground on the Isle of Wight. Les never kept in touch and it was not until Greg turned up in Weatherfield in April 1998 that Les even knew he had a son. Greg's early years were hard, but when he was around two, his mother started working for Harry Wood whom she subsequently married and he brought Greg up as his own. Moira told Greg about his past when he was 7, but it took Harry's death in September 1997 to spur Greg on to seek his natural father.\n\nGreg previously had played football for [[Stoke City F.C.]] when they had been playing at their former ground, [[Victoria Ground]]. A cruciate ligament injury however ended his footballing career, and so he followed Harry into the manufacturing and retail fashion business.\n\nWith his relationship with his less-than-exemplary biological father expanding, Greg became more involved in the happenings of the Street. He struck up a relationship with Maxine Heavey, the local hairdresser. Always looking for \"something better\" he had an eye for a business deal and prospective bed partner. Greg convinced Mike Baldwin to take him on as a business partner - he would suss out the deals and Mike would pay him on a commission basis. Mike, seeing this as a win-win proposition agreed. Greg went to work at the factory.\n\nHe soon turned his attentions to Sally Webster, who had just lost her mum. Sally had inherited \u00a355,000 and this was very appealing to Greg. He was more interested in her money than her but set his cap to relieve her of some of it. He ended his relationship with Maxine after relieving her of her intended flat above the Corner shop. Sally left her husband Kevin and their daughters behind to enter into what she thought would be a commitment with a new, exciting man. Realizing that she needed her children with her, Sally and the girls moved into the one bedroom flat above the shop. It was a tight fit and one that Greg took an immediate dislike to but he needed Sally's money if he were to make a go of his new underwear venture so he tried to remember the girls' names (unsuccessfully) and play happy families. Greg did not want to be a parent and left the flat as often as he could. It became clear to all but Sally, that Greg was simply using her.\n\nAfter stealing all the contacts from Mike's computer at the factory, he took Sally's money and started his own company. Mike, not easily taken, fought back and won the contracts back. By now Greg had opened a \"shop\" and had Sally as his secretary rather than business partner. He felt the \"optics\" would be better. The loss of the contracts proved a turning point in their relationship however. Unhappy with the living arrangements, and especially with the girls, Greg's temper simmered just below boiling point for weeks. Then upon discovering that Sally had inadvertently told Gail about the contracts, he exploded and hit her, blaming her for the loss.\n\nSally, stunned at the turn in the relationship, threatened to leave until Greg convinced her it was a one off and that it would not happen again. Of course Greg had spoken to his solicitor to find out what would happen if they broke up. The solicitor informed him that Greg needed Sally and her fast dwindling capital in order to stay in business. Greg needed to come up with another plan - one that would see him financially secure at the expense of Sally. The three of them were crowding his style as well as his apartment and he needed to be shut of the lot - Sally, Rosie and Sophie. But if he had to persevere, to achieve his goal of financial and personal freedom, he would.\n\nIt was a short-lived respite from the violence. After a second beating from Greg, Sally took the kids, and what remained of her bank account and fled to Rita's without looking back. Greg, having not paid his rent, was threatened with eviction from the pokey flat over the shop and his life careened out of control. Becoming more and more dishelved the suits looking less smart and his appearance slipping - he turned once again to Maxine who, after a short fashion, cottoned on to his scheme to finagle a free ride and accommodation until something better came along. She quickly sent him off and with nowhere else to go, he ended up at the Battersbys living with his father and his family.\n\nBlaming Sally for all of his problems, Greg began stalking and threatening her. Sally lived in fear for her safety and that of her two young girls. Greg, drunk and unhinged, broke into Rita's apartment and threatened Sally that he would \"make her pay for what she did\". She escaped what looked to be her final beating, and fled to the safety of the Street. Greg left the Street, after stealing the last of the money from Janice Battersby's leccie tin, at the end of 1998. Greg made a return in May 1999 and held Sally and her two daughters hostage in their own home in an attempt to force her to help him blackmail Mike after he had proof that Mike had been seeing another woman behind his wife Alma's back. The police were called and in a last-ditch attempt to protect her daughters, she hit Greg over the head with a chair, knocking him out cold, the police then stormed the house and Greg was arrested. He was later charged with false imprisonment.\n\n==Edna Miller==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series=[[Coronation Street]]|\n| name = Edna Miller\n| years = 1998, 2000\u20132001\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#M|Former; regular]]\n| introducer=[[Brian Park]] (1998)<br>Jane MacNaught (2000)\n| first = 24 June 1998\n| last = 19 September 2001\n| death = 19 September 2001\n| occupation = Cleaner|\n| portrayer = Joan Kempson|\n| sisters = Iris Merry|\n| husband = Leslie \n}}\n'''Edna Miller''' first appears in September 1998, as she is interviewed by [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn|Liz Dawn]]) for the new job as barmaid in [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]].

She befriended fellow machinists [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]) and [[#Alison Webster|Alison Wakefield]] ([[Naomi Radcliffe]]), becoming bridesmaid at Alison's wedding to [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) in January 2000. She strongly disapproved of [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), as she was disgusted when she learned that Hayley was a [[transsexual]], but they later became friends.\n\nLinda had a particularly tough background. Her mother, [[Eve Elliott|Eve]] ([[Melanie Kilburn]]), walked out when Linda was young and she, being the eldest, had to help her father [[Ray Sykes|Ray]] ([[Peter Guinness (actor)|Peter Guinness]]) raise her three younger brothers. When she was 15, her close friend, [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), moved in after she became estranged from her parents and they later went on to work as machinists in a factory called ''Wheelers''.\n\nShortly after her arrival, Linda's boss [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) and his wife [[Alma Baldwin|Alma]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) separated, following the revelation of Mike's affair with a former prostitute named Julia. Linda comforted her boss, who was 33 years her senior, and they soon started sleeping together. They began an affair which culminated when Mike proposed marriage and she accepted, knowing that he was a millionaire entrepreneur. As they planned to marry, Mike got in touch with his son [[Mark Redman (Coronation Street)|Mark Redman]] ([[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]) and invited him to the wedding. Linda took a shine to Mike's son, who was not much younger than her, and she soon began an affair with him. However, as the wedding day approached, Linda decided to end the affair with Mark so that her wedding could go ahead. Mark, however, was infatuated with his father's fianc\u00e9e and was devastated by her brush-off, so much so, that he halted the wedding by not coming initially and dragging Linda out of the church to speak to her. Linda's bridesmaid, [[Geena Gregory]] ([[Jennifer James]]), stalled the ceremony with a worried Mike standing at the altar alone while Mark proposed to Linda. She turned him down and returned to the church, telling Mike that he'd need to get a new best man as Mark had scarpered. Mark drowned his sorrows while Mike and Linda got married on 10 September 2000. However, Mark arrived at the wedding reception to tell his father that he and Linda had been having an affair. The bride admitted to Mike that, in a moment of weakness, she'd had a brief fling with Mark when he first arrived but it was over and she loved him more than anything else. Taking his new wife's side over his son's, an angry Mike disowned a devastated Mark and left for his honeymoon with Linda.\n\nAfter returning, Linda did almost everything in her power to make her marriage successful and keep Mike happy, so that he would not throw her out for her infidelity. However, it soon became apparent that he still had a soft spot for his ex-wife Alma. This became more apparent when both Mike and Alma and other residents of the street were held hostage on 12 October 2000 at the supermarket Freshco's by two young thugs. The police eventually burst in and one of the young thugs was shot. However, when Linda arrived at the scene, she not only found her husband with his ex-wife, but also recognised that the thug who had been shot was her younger brother [[Dean Sykes]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]). Accompanied by Mike in the ambulance, a devastated Linda held her brother's hand as he died. After that she swore revenge on [[Emma Watts]] ([[Angela Lonsdale]]), the police officer who shot him.\n\nIt was then that Mike was introduced to Linda's family at Dean's funeral. Linda was very cold and distant to all her family members, treating them as if she was now above them, and she was especially hard towards her mother Eve. However, after the funeral Linda managed to patch things up with her mother and Eve returned to the street with her, where she met and fell in love with [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]).\n\nIn February 2001, Mike confesses to her that his ex-wife [[Susan Barlow]] ([[Joanna Foster]]) had his son [[Adam Barlow]] twelve years earlier and didn't tell him about his existence, Linda was unimpressed.\n\nLinda's marriage continued to go downhill as Mike learned that Alma was [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] with [[cervical cancer]]. This led to him caring for her and going on trips around the country with her, resulting in Linda embarking on an affair with a man named Harvey, one of Mike's clients, in May 2001. After being caught in the act by Mike in June 2001, Linda finally snapped and went round to Alma's to have it out with her. However, during their heated argument Alma collapsed and after calling an ambulance, Alma was diagnosed with kidney failure and carried upstairs to her bedroom by paramedics where she died in peace on 17 June 2001 with Mike, her best friend [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) and Audrey's daughter [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]) by her side.\n\nLinda was racked with guilt over the entire incident, and Mike soon made it clear that he could never trust her again. He announced that he wanted a divorce, but Linda was not prepared to go without a fight. After enduring months of heated arguments, Mike finally set his wife up by bringing his son Mark back to the street. As Linda prepared to rekindle their old romance, Mike walked in on them and triumphantly announced that their marriage was over.\n\nThey stayed together for an extra only for appearances sake as her mother was preparing to tie the knot with Fred. However, as the wedding took place on 5 September 2001, Mike made it clear to Linda that she would be gone by the end of the ceremony. He called a taxi for her and, along with Mark, dragged her from her hotel room to the taxi and sent her packing. She was never seen again.\n\nAfter her departure, there was much debate over whether Mike had killed Linda and disposed of her body or not. Her car was found near the canal, and both her mother Eve and her brother Jimmy vowed to find her. However, Eve later discovered from her ex-husband Ray that Linda is alive and well and living in Dublin with a rich fianc\u00e9. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Tyrone Dobbs==\n{{Main|Tyrone Dobbs}}\n\n'''Tyrone Sylvester Dobbs''' is a [[fictional character]] from the long-running [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

Greg was the long-lost son of [[Les Battersby-Brown|Les Battersby]] and is best known for his ultimately abusive relationship with [[Sally Webster]].\n\nGreg was the result of a holiday romance between Moira Kelly and Les Battersby when he was working on a travelling fairground on the Isle of Wight. Les never kept in touch and it was not until Greg turned up in Weatherfield in April 1998 that Les even knew he had a son. Greg's early years were hard, but when he was around two, his mother started working for Harry Wood whom she subsequently married and he brought Greg up as his own. Moira told Greg about his past when he was 7, but it took Harry's death in September 1997 to spur Greg on to seek his natural father.\n\nGreg previously had played football for [[Stoke City F.C.]] when they had been playing at their former ground, [[Victoria Ground]]. A cruciate ligament injury however ended his footballing career, and so he followed Harry into the manufacturing and retail fashion business.\n\nWith his relationship with his less-than-exemplary biological father expanding, Greg became more involved in the happenings of the Street. He struck up a relationship with Maxine Heavey, the local hairdresser. Always looking for \"something better\" he had an eye for a business deal and prospective bed partner. Greg convinced Mike Baldwin to take him on as a business partner - he would suss out the deals and Mike would pay him on a commission basis. Mike, seeing this as a win-win proposition agreed. Greg went to work at the factory.\n\nHe soon turned his attentions to Sally Webster, who had just lost her mum. Sally had inherited \u00a355,000 and this was very appealing to Greg. He was more interested in her money than her but set his cap to relieve her of some of it. He ended his relationship with Maxine after relieving her of her intended flat above the Corner shop. Sally left her husband Kevin and their daughters behind to enter into what she thought would be a commitment with a new, exciting man. Realizing that she needed her children with her, Sally and the girls moved into the one bedroom flat above the shop. It was a tight fit and one that Greg took an immediate dislike to but he needed Sally's money if he were to make a go of his new underwear venture so he tried to remember the girls' names (unsuccessfully) and play happy families. Greg did not want to be a parent and left the flat as often as he could. It became clear to all but Sally, that Greg was simply using her.\n\nAfter stealing all the contacts from Mike's computer at the factory, he took Sally's money and started his own company. Mike, not easily taken, fought back and won the contracts back. By now Greg had opened a \"shop\" and had Sally as his secretary rather than business partner. He felt the \"optics\" would be better. The loss of the contracts proved a turning point in their relationship however. Unhappy with the living arrangements, and especially with the girls, Greg's temper simmered just below boiling point for weeks. Then upon discovering that Sally had inadvertently told Gail about the contracts, he exploded and hit her, blaming her for the loss.\n\nSally, stunned at the turn in the relationship, threatened to leave until Greg convinced her it was a one off and that it would not happen again. Of course Greg had spoken to his solicitor to find out what would happen if they broke up. The solicitor informed him that Greg needed Sally and her fast dwindling capital in order to stay in business. Greg needed to come up with another plan - one that would see him financially secure at the expense of Sally. The three of them were crowding his style as well as his apartment and he needed to be shut of the lot - Sally, Rosie and Sophie. But if he had to persevere, to achieve his goal of financial and personal freedom, he would.\n\nIt was a short-lived respite from the violence. After a second beating from Greg, Sally took the kids, and what remained of her bank account and fled to Rita's without looking back. Greg, having not paid his rent, was threatened with eviction from the pokey flat over the shop and his life careened out of control. Becoming more and more dishelved the suits looking less smart and his appearance slipping - he turned once again to Maxine who, after a short fashion, cottoned on to his scheme to finagle a free ride and accommodation until something better came along. She quickly sent him off and with nowhere else to go, he ended up at the Battersbys living with his father and his family.\n\nBlaming Sally for all of his problems, Greg began stalking and threatening her. Sally lived in fear for her safety and that of her two young girls. Greg, drunk and unhinged, broke into Rita's apartment and threatened Sally that he would \"make her pay for what she did\". She escaped what looked to be her final beating, and fled to the safety of the Street. Greg left the Street, after stealing the last of the money from Janice Battersby's leccie tin, at the end of 1998. Greg made a return in May 1999 and held Sally and her two daughters hostage in their own home in an attempt to force her to help him blackmail Mike after he had proof that Mike had been seeing another woman behind his wife Alma's back. The police were called and in a last-ditch attempt to protect her daughters, she hit Greg over the head with a chair, knocking him out cold, the police then stormed the house and Greg was arrested. He was later charged with false imprisonment.\n\n==Edna Miller==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series=[[Coronation Street]]|\n| name = Edna Miller\n| years = 1998, 2000\u20132001\n| classification = [[List of past Coronation Street characters#M|Former; regular]]\n| introducer=[[Brian Park]] (1998)<br>Jane MacNaught (2000)\n| first = 24 June 1998\n| last = 19 September 2001\n| death = 19 September 2001\n| occupation = Cleaner|\n| portrayer = Joan Kempson|\n| sisters = Iris Merry|\n| husband = Leslie \n}}\n'''Edna Miller''' first appears in September 1998, as she is interviewed by [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn|Liz Dawn]]) for the new job as barmaid in [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]].

She befriended fellow machinists [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]) and [[#Alison Webster|Alison Wakefield]] ([[Naomi Radcliffe]]), becoming bridesmaid at Alison's wedding to [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) in January 2000. She strongly disapproved of [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), as she was disgusted when she learned that Hayley was a [[transsexual]], but they later became friends.\n\nLinda had a particularly tough background. Her mother, [[Eve Elliott|Eve]] ([[Melanie Kilburn]]), walked out when Linda was young and she, being the eldest, had to help her father [[Ray Sykes|Ray]] ([[Peter Guinness (actor)|Peter Guinness]]) raise her three younger brothers. When she was 15, her close friend, [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), moved in after she became estranged from her parents and they later went on to work as machinists in a factory called ''Wheelers''.\n\nShortly after her arrival, Linda's boss [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) and his wife [[Alma Baldwin|Alma]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) separated, following the revelation of Mike's affair with a former prostitute named Julia. Linda comforted her boss, who was 33 years her senior, and they soon started sleeping together. They began an affair which culminated when Mike proposed marriage and she accepted, knowing that he was a millionaire entrepreneur. As they planned to marry, Mike got in touch with his son [[Mark Redman (Coronation Street)|Mark Redman]] ([[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]) and invited him to the wedding. Linda took a shine to Mike's son, who was not much younger than her, and she soon began an affair with him. However, as the wedding day approached, Linda decided to end the affair with Mark so that her wedding could go ahead. Mark, however, was infatuated with his father's fianc\u00e9e and was devastated by her brush-off, so much so, that he halted the wedding by not coming initially and dragging Linda out of the church to speak to her. Linda's bridesmaid, [[Geena Gregory]] ([[Jennifer James]]), stalled the ceremony with a worried Mike standing at the altar alone while Mark proposed to Linda. She turned him down and returned to the church, telling Mike that he'd need to get a new best man as Mark had scarpered. Mark drowned his sorrows while Mike and Linda got married on 10 September 2000. However, Mark arrived at the wedding reception to tell his father that he and Linda had been having an affair. The bride admitted to Mike that, in a moment of weakness, she'd had a brief fling with Mark when he first arrived but it was over and she loved him more than anything else. Taking his new wife's side over his son's, an angry Mike disowned a devastated Mark and left for his honeymoon with Linda.\n\nAfter returning, Linda did almost everything in her power to make her marriage successful and keep Mike happy, so that he would not throw her out for her infidelity. However, it soon became apparent that he still had a soft spot for his ex-wife Alma. This became more apparent when both Mike and Alma and other residents of the street were held hostage on 12 October 2000 at the supermarket Freshco's by two young thugs. The police eventually burst in and one of the young thugs was shot. However, when Linda arrived at the scene, she not only found her husband with his ex-wife, but also recognised that the thug who had been shot was her younger brother [[Dean Sykes]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths]]). Accompanied by Mike in the ambulance, a devastated Linda held her brother's hand as he died. After that she swore revenge on [[Emma Watts]] ([[Angela Lonsdale]]), the police officer who shot him.\n\nIt was then that Mike was introduced to Linda's family at Dean's funeral. Linda was very cold and distant to all her family members, treating them as if she was now above them, and she was especially hard towards her mother Eve. However, after the funeral Linda managed to patch things up with her mother and Eve returned to the street with her, where she met and fell in love with [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]).\n\nIn February 2001, Mike confesses to her that his ex-wife [[Susan Barlow]] ([[Joanna Foster]]) had his son [[Adam Barlow]] twelve years earlier and didn't tell him about his existence, Linda was unimpressed.\n\nLinda's marriage continued to go downhill as Mike learned that Alma was [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] with [[cervical cancer]]. This led to him caring for her and going on trips around the country with her, resulting in Linda embarking on an affair with a man named Harvey, one of Mike's clients, in May 2001. After being caught in the act by Mike in June 2001, Linda finally snapped and went round to Alma's to have it out with her. However, during their heated argument Alma collapsed and after calling an ambulance, Alma was diagnosed with kidney failure and carried upstairs to her bedroom by paramedics where she died in peace on 17 June 2001 with Mike, her best friend [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) and Audrey's daughter [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]) by her side.\n\nLinda was racked with guilt over the entire incident, and Mike soon made it clear that he could never trust her again. He announced that he wanted a divorce, but Linda was not prepared to go without a fight. After enduring months of heated arguments, Mike finally set his wife up by bringing his son Mark back to the street. As Linda prepared to rekindle their old romance, Mike walked in on them and triumphantly announced that their marriage was over.\n\nThey stayed together for an extra only for appearances sake as her mother was preparing to tie the knot with Fred. However, as the wedding took place on 5 September 2001, Mike made it clear to Linda that she would be gone by the end of the ceremony. He called a taxi for her and, along with Mark, dragged her from her hotel room to the taxi and sent her packing. She was never seen again.\n\nAfter her departure, there was much debate over whether Mike had killed Linda and disposed of her body or not. Her car was found near the canal, and both her mother Eve and her brother Jimmy vowed to find her. However, Eve later discovered from her ex-husband Ray that Linda is alive and well and living in Dublin with a rich fianc\u00e9. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Tyrone Dobbs==\n{{Main|Tyrone Dobbs}}\n\n'''Tyrone Sylvester Dobbs''' is a [[fictional character]] from the long-running [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

Gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]: players have no defined objectives, but are instead encouraged to spend their time in the village performing any number of activities, which include collecting items, planting plants or other items, and socializing with the village's residents. ''Animal Crossing'' games are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]], utilizing the [[video game console]]'s internal clock and calendar. Thus, passage of time in the game world reflects that in reality, as well as the current season and time of day. Some in-game events, such as holidays or the growth of a tree, occur at certain times or require some duration of time to have passed.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\"/>\n\nOne notable feature of the ''Animal Crossing'' series is the high level of customization available, some of which affects the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\" /> The [[player character]] is both named and gendered by the real life player at the start of the game, and their appearance can be modified by buying or designing custom clothes and accessories or changing the hairstyle (introduced in ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World|Wild World]]''). The player's house can also be furnished, decorated, and later expanded: the player can purchase and collect furniture and place it anywhere in the house, as well as change both the wallpaper and floor designs. While its terrain, building locations, and initial residents are randomly generated when the game is first begun (except in ''Animal Crossing: New Leaf'', in which the player decides between four given towns, and ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'', in which the player similarly decides between four given islands), the village's name and anthem, as well as some of the residents' catchphrases, are also determined by the player.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_review\"/>\n\nCollecting items is a major facet of ''Animal Crossing'': the player can explore the village and gather objects, including fruit from trees, seashells, and discarded items. Nearly all objects can be sold for Bells, the in-game currency. Players collect objects to obtain more Bells, which can then be used to buy furniture and clothing, purchase home expansions, invest in stocks, and play games. A number of specialized tools are available for other activities such as fishing and insect collecting. Special items, such as fossils and paintings, may be donated to the village museum. The player can choose to socialize with the other animal residents by engaging in conversation, sending and receiving letters, bartering, or playing hide-and-seek. Residents may move in or out of the village depending on the player's actions.\n\nAll installments of ''Animal Crossing'' allow some form of communication between players, both offline and [[Online game|online]]. A single village can house up to four human players, though only one can be exploring the village at any given time.<ref name=\"IGN_GC_preview\">{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/30/animal-crossing |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The players can interact via written messages through the village post office or bulletin board.

She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted.

These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\n:''See also: [[Midrasha #Curriculum]]; [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].''\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach. A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish day school]]s, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Image:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \"\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\" \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1 (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary, [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.]]\nBranches exist in most North American cities with large [[:Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|populations of Orthodox Jews]] such as New York City, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Toronto, [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], and in most Israeli cities.

It is bordered to the east by [[Kenya]], to the north by [[South Sudan]], to the west by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], to the south-west by [[Rwanda]], and to the south by [[Tanzania]]. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of [[Lake Victoria]], shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Uganda also lies within the [[Nile|Nile basin]], and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate.\n\nUganda takes its name from the [[Buganda]] kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital [[Kampala]]. The people of Uganda were [[hunter-gatherer]]s until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago, when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country.\n\nBeginning in 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the UK, who established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long [[Far right politics|far right]] [[military dictatorship]] led by [[Idi Amin]]. Additionally, a [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|lengthy civil war]] against the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] in the Northern Region led by [[Joseph Kony]], has caused hundreds of thousands of casualties.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2012/03/08/who_is_joseph_kony_a_look_at_the_ugandan_warlord.html | title=Who is Joseph Kony?

Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence, but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Crawford|title=The politics of cultural pluralism|date=1979|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=9780299067441|pages=248\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nWithin Buganda there were divisions \u2013 between those who wanted the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] to remain a dominant monarch, and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties \u2013 the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mutibwa|first1=Phares|title=Uganda since independence, a story of unfulfilled hopes|date=1992|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781850650669}}</ref>\n\nOutside Buganda, a quiet spoken politician from Northern Uganda, [[Milton Obote]], had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC). The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda's special status. This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda. The party however remained a loose alliance of interests but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.<ref name=\"Kasozi\">{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=A.

Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament. In the pre-Independence elections, the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats (outside Buganda). The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda. The \"special status\" granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament \u2013 the Lukikko. KY won a resounding victory over DP, winning all 21 seats.\n\nThe UPC reached a high at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, [[Basil Kiiza Bataringaya]] crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs, leaving DP with only nine seats. The DP MPs were not particularly happy that their leader Benedicto Kiwanuka's hostility towards the Kabaka that was hindering their chances of compromise with KY.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bade|first1=Albert|title=Benedicto Kiwanuka : the man and his politics|date=1996|publisher=Fountain Publ.|location=Kampala|isbn=978-9970020089}}</ref> The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ciment|first1=James|title=Encyclopedia of conflicts since World War II|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780765680051|page=311|edition=2nd}}</ref> The response from the Kabaka was mute \u2013 probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time Uganda had become independent, Buganda \"was a divided house with contending social and political forces\"<ref name=Kasozi63>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=63|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\nThere were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional and personal interests began to shake the party. The party's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=71|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe UPC delegates arrived in [[Gulu]] in 1964 for their delegates conference. Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party. The battle over the Secretary General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate's candidate \u2013 [[Grace Ibingira]] and the radical John Kakonge. Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC. This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government. For those outside the UPC (including KY supporters), this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable. Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=70|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda's \"special status\". In 1964 The government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka's subjects. Prior to colonial rule Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring [[Bunyoro]] kingdom. Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements. Known as the \"lost counties\", the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro. Obote decided to allow a referendum, which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda. The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka's attempts to influence the vote.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lamwaka|first1=Caroline|title=The Raging Storm: A Reporter's Inside Account of the Northern Uganda War, 1986\u20132005|date=2016|publisher=Fountain Publishers|location=Kampala|isbn=978-9970252213}}</ref> Having lost the referendum, KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro, thus ending the alliance with the UPC.\n\nThe tribal nature of Ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government. The UPC which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC. The \"North/South\" ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics. Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians \u2013 A. A. Neykon, Felix Onama, Alex Ojera \u2013 while Ibingira's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him, were mainly from the South \u2013 George Magezi, B. Kirya, Matthias Ngobi. In time, the two factions acquired ethnic labels \u2013 \"Bantu\" (the mainly Southern Ibingira faction) and \"Nilotic\" (the mainly Northern Obote faction). The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira.<ref name=\"Otunnu\">{{cite book|last1=Otunnu|first1=Ogenga|title=Crisis of Legitimacy and Political Violence in Uganda, 1890 to 1979|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-3319331553}}</ref>\n[[File:SA18157-Crowned Crane - \u017buraw Kr\u00f3lewski.jpg|thumb|Grey Crowned Crane - a symbol of Uganda.|alt=]]\nThese labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences. First Buganda \u2013 the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction. The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka.<ref name=\"Otunnu\" /> They were now aligned to opposing Obote. Second \u2013 the security forces \u2013 the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles. At independence, the army and police was dominated by northern tribes \u2013 mainly Nilotic. They would now feel more affiliated to Obote, and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power. In April 1966, Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at [[Moroto Town|Moroto]], of whom seventy percent came from the Northern Region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=83|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIt is true that at the time there was a tendency to see central government and security forces as dominated by \"northerners\" \u2013 particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at national level.<ref name=\"LRA-MR\">{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Tim|last2=Vlassenroot|first2=Koen|title=The Lord's Resistance Army: myth and reality|date=2010|publisher=Zed|location=London|isbn=9781848135635}}</ref> In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings, particularly over the kingdom's \"special status\" before and after independence, and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status. \"Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state, both through the civil service and military, and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda\".<ref name=\"LRA-MR\" /> However, both \"Bantu\" and \"Nilotic\" labels represent significant ambiguities. The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro \u2013 historically bitter rivals. The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara, Acholi and Langi who have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda's military politics later. Despite these ambiguities, these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics.\n\nThe UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote's vulnerability. At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders. Even in Obote's home district, attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966. A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 \u2013 and without the support of KY (who were now likely to back the DP), and the growing factionalism in the UPC, there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months.\n\nObote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda. KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs, the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng. Ochieng was an irony \u2013 although from Northern Uganda, he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda. In Obote's absence from Parliament, Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote's army chief of staff, Colonel [[Idi Amin]]. He further alleged that Obote, Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Somerville|first1=Keith|title=Ivory: Power and Poaching in Africa|date=2017|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781849046763}}</ref> Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote's involvement. This shook the government and raised tensions in the country.\n\nKY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference where Godfrey Binaisa (the Attorney General) was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY, Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda.<ref name=Kasozi63 /> Obote's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966. In March 1966, Obote also announced that the offices of President and Vice-President would cease to exist \u2013 effectively dismissing the Kabaka. Obote also gave Amin more power \u2013 giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder (Opolot) who had relations to Buganda through marriage (possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that). Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months. Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup.\nObote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures:\n* The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units. This removed the Kabaka's authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda.\n* The abolition of the Buganda High Court \u2013 removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had.\n* The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control.\n* Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs. Land is one the key sources of Kabaka's power over his subjects.\n\nThe lines were now drawn for a show down between Buganda and the Central government. Historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise. This was unlikely as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak. Indeed, by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC, the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other. Within Buganda's political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained. The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=64|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1966, the Kabaka made his move. He asked for foreign help and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda (including the capital, Kampala). In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka's palace. The battle for the Kabaka's palace was fierce \u2013 the Kabaka's guards putting up more resistance that had been expected. The British trained Captain \u2013 the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=85|location=|isbn=}}</ref> It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.\n\n===1966\u20131971 (before the coup)===\nIn 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president. In 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms.

The first are filmmakers who use the [[Nollywood]] [[video film era]]'s guerrilla approach to film making, churning out a picture in around two weeks and screening it in makeshift video halls. The second is the filmmaker who has the film aesthetic, but with limited funds has to depend on the competitive scramble for donor cash.<ref name=\"cannesvupar.com\"/>\n\nThough cinema in Uganda is evolving it still faces major challenges. Along with technical problems such as refining acting and editing skills, there are issues regarding funding and lack of government support and investment. There are no schools in the country dedicated to film, banks do not extend credit to film ventures, and distribution and marketing of movies remains poor.<ref name=\"cannesvupar.com\"/><ref name=\"monitor.co.ug\"/>\n\nThe Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) is preparing regulations starting in 2014 that require Ugandan television to broadcast 70 percent Ugandan content and of this, 40 percent to be independent productions.

The people of Uganda were [[hunter-gatherer]]s until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago, when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country.\n\nBeginning in 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the UK, who established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long [[Far right politics|far right]] [[military dictatorship]] led by [[Idi Amin]]. Additionally, a [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|lengthy civil war]] against the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] in the Northern Region led by [[Joseph Kony]], has caused hundreds of thousands of casualties.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2012/03/08/who_is_joseph_kony_a_look_at_the_ugandan_warlord.html | title=Who is Joseph Kony?

Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence, but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Crawford|title=The politics of cultural pluralism|date=1979|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=9780299067441|pages=248\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nWithin Buganda there were divisions \u2013 between those who wanted the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] to remain a dominant monarch, and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties \u2013 the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mutibwa|first1=Phares|title=Uganda since independence, a story of unfulfilled hopes|date=1992|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781850650669}}</ref>\n\nOutside Buganda, a quiet spoken politician from Northern Uganda, [[Milton Obote]], had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC). The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda's special status. This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda. The party however remained a loose alliance of interests but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.<ref name=\"Kasozi\">{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=A.

Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament. In the pre-Independence elections, the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats (outside Buganda). The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda. The \"special status\" granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament \u2013 the Lukikko. KY won a resounding victory over DP, winning all 21 seats.\n\nThe UPC reached a high at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, [[Basil Kiiza Bataringaya]] crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs, leaving DP with only nine seats. The DP MPs were not particularly happy that their leader Benedicto Kiwanuka's hostility towards the Kabaka that was hindering their chances of compromise with KY.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bade|first1=Albert|title=Benedicto Kiwanuka : the man and his politics|date=1996|publisher=Fountain Publ.|location=Kampala|isbn=978-9970020089}}</ref> The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ciment|first1=James|title=Encyclopedia of conflicts since World War II|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780765680051|page=311|edition=2nd}}</ref> The response from the Kabaka was mute \u2013 probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time Uganda had become independent, Buganda \"was a divided house with contending social and political forces\"<ref name=Kasozi63>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=63|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\nThere were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional and personal interests began to shake the party. The party's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=71|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe UPC delegates arrived in [[Gulu]] in 1964 for their delegates conference. Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party. The battle over the Secretary General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate's candidate \u2013 [[Grace Ibingira]] and the radical John Kakonge. Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC. This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government. For those outside the UPC (including KY supporters), this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable. Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=70|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda's \"special status\". In 1964 The government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka's subjects. Prior to colonial rule Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring [[Bunyoro]] kingdom. Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements. Known as the \"lost counties\", the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro. Obote decided to allow a referendum, which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda. The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka's attempts to influence the vote.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lamwaka|first1=Caroline|title=The Raging Storm: A Reporter's Inside Account of the Northern Uganda War, 1986\u20132005|date=2016|publisher=Fountain Publishers|location=Kampala|isbn=978-9970252213}}</ref> Having lost the referendum, KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro, thus ending the alliance with the UPC.\n\nThe tribal nature of Ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government. The UPC which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC. The \"North/South\" ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics. Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians \u2013 A. A. Neykon, Felix Onama, Alex Ojera \u2013 while Ibingira's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him, were mainly from the South \u2013 George Magezi, B. Kirya, Matthias Ngobi. In time, the two factions acquired ethnic labels \u2013 \"Bantu\" (the mainly Southern Ibingira faction) and \"Nilotic\" (the mainly Northern Obote faction). The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira.<ref name=\"Otunnu\">{{cite book|last1=Otunnu|first1=Ogenga|title=Crisis of Legitimacy and Political Violence in Uganda, 1890 to 1979|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-3319331553}}</ref>\n[[File:SA18157-Crowned Crane - \u017buraw Kr\u00f3lewski.jpg|thumb|Grey Crowned Crane - a symbol of Uganda.|alt=]]\nThese labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences. First Buganda \u2013 the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction. The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka.<ref name=\"Otunnu\" /> They were now aligned to opposing Obote. Second \u2013 the security forces \u2013 the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles. At independence, the army and police was dominated by northern tribes \u2013 mainly Nilotic. They would now feel more affiliated to Obote, and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power. In April 1966, Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at [[Moroto Town|Moroto]], of whom seventy percent came from the Northern Region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=83|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIt is true that at the time there was a tendency to see central government and security forces as dominated by \"northerners\" \u2013 particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at national level.<ref name=\"LRA-MR\">{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Tim|last2=Vlassenroot|first2=Koen|title=The Lord's Resistance Army: myth and reality|date=2010|publisher=Zed|location=London|isbn=9781848135635}}</ref> In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings, particularly over the kingdom's \"special status\" before and after independence, and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status. \"Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state, both through the civil service and military, and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda\".<ref name=\"LRA-MR\" /> However, both \"Bantu\" and \"Nilotic\" labels represent significant ambiguities. The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro \u2013 historically bitter rivals. The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara, Acholi and Langi who have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda's military politics later. Despite these ambiguities, these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics.\n\nThe UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote's vulnerability. At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders. Even in Obote's home district, attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966. A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 \u2013 and without the support of KY (who were now likely to back the DP), and the growing factionalism in the UPC, there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months.\n\nObote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda. KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs, the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng. Ochieng was an irony \u2013 although from Northern Uganda, he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda. In Obote's absence from Parliament, Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote's army chief of staff, Colonel [[Idi Amin]]. He further alleged that Obote, Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Somerville|first1=Keith|title=Ivory: Power and Poaching in Africa|date=2017|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781849046763}}</ref> Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote's involvement. This shook the government and raised tensions in the country.\n\nKY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference where Godfrey Binaisa (the Attorney General) was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY, Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda.<ref name=Kasozi63 /> Obote's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966. In March 1966, Obote also announced that the offices of President and Vice-President would cease to exist \u2013 effectively dismissing the Kabaka. Obote also gave Amin more power \u2013 giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder (Opolot) who had relations to Buganda through marriage (possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that). Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months. Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup.\nObote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures:\n* The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units. This removed the Kabaka's authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda.\n* The abolition of the Buganda High Court \u2013 removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had.\n* The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control.\n* Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs. Land is one the key sources of Kabaka's power over his subjects.\n\nThe lines were now drawn for a show down between Buganda and the Central government. Historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise. This was unlikely as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak. Indeed, by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC, the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other. Within Buganda's political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained. The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=64|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1966, the Kabaka made his move. He asked for foreign help and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda (including the capital, Kampala). In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka's palace. The battle for the Kabaka's palace was fierce \u2013 the Kabaka's guards putting up more resistance that had been expected. The British trained Captain \u2013 the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=85|location=|isbn=}}</ref> It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.\n\n===1966\u20131971 (before the coup)===\nIn 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president.

Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures (i.e. requiring recommendations from government officials; annual re-registration), unreasonable regulation of operations (i.e. requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO's area of interest), and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda, among other things, are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector. Furthermore, the sector's freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation, and the recent Public Order Management Bill (severely limiting freedom of assembly) will only add to the government's stockpile of ammunition.<ref>The International Center for Not-For-Profit Law.

Along with technical problems such as refining acting and editing skills, there are issues regarding funding and lack of government support and investment.
