{"title_page": "Count Dracula in popular culture", "text_new": "[[File:DraculaWaxMuseum.JPG|thumb|right|Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula at the Hollywood Wax Museum]]\nThe character of [[Count Dracula]] from the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]], has remained popular over the years, and many films have used the Count as a villain, while others have named him in their titles, such as ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', ''[[The Brides of Dracula (film)|The Brides of Dracula]]'', and ''[[Dracula's Dog]]''. ''Dracula'' has enjoyed enormous popularity since its publication and has spawned an extraordinary vampire subculture in the second half of the 20th century. More than 200 films have been made that feature Count Dracula, a number second only to [[Sherlock Holmes]]. At the center of this subculture is the legend of [[Transylvania]], which has become almost synonymous with vampires.\n\nMost adaptations do not include all the major characters from the novel. The Count is usually present, and [[Jonathan Harker|Jonathan]] and [[Mina Harker]], [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]], [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]], and [[Renfield]] usually appear as well. The characters of Mina Harker and [[Lucy Westenra]] are occasionally combined into a single female role. Jonathan Harker and Renfield are also sometimes reversed or combined. [[Quincey Morris]] and [[Arthur Holmwood]] are often omitted or, occasionally, combined into one character.\n\n==Films==\n\n===Early adaptations===\nThere are reports of a 1920 Soviet silent film '''''Drakula''''' ({{lang|ru|\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430|italic=yes}}), based on Stoker's novel. The film would have predated the lost 1921 Hungarian film ''[[Dracula's Death]]'', and is thus claimed to be the first film adaption of ''Dracula''. Nothing regarding this film is known to survive; there are no known production stills, and there is very little information about this film available. Most sources agree that the existence of this film is questionable because no details appear to have survived, and its existence is not verifiable.<ref>Glut, Donald F. ''The Dracula Book'' (1975) (\"Other film versions of Dracula are reported to have been made about this time \u2014 one being Russian \u2014 but there is no real verification to substantiate these claims.\")</ref>\n\nOne of the first film adaptations of Stoker's story caused Stoker's estate to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. In 1922, [[silent film]] director [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] made a [[horror film]] called ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu: eine Symphonie des Grauens]]'' (\"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\"), which took the story of Dracula and set it in [[Transylvania]] and Germany. In the story, Dracula's role was changed to that of [[Count Orlok]], played by [[Max Schreck]].\n\nThe Stoker estate won its lawsuit, and all existing prints of ''Nosferatu'' were ordered destroyed. However, a number of [[copyright infringement|unlicensed]] copies of the movie survived to the present era, where they entered the public domain.\n\nThe 1931 film version of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' was based on the 1927 stage play dramatised, with the Stoker estate's endorsement, by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L. Balderston]] (see below); it starred [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Van Helsing, both of whom had originated their respective roles on the stage in the aforementioned play, along with [[Helen Chandler]] as Mina and [[Dwight Frye]] as Renfield. Directed by [[Tod Browning]], it is one of the most famous versions of the story and is widely credited with initiating the [[Universal Monsters|Universal]] horror film series of the 1930s and \u201840s. The 1931 Dracula film was an inductee of the 2000 [[National Film Registry]] list.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/</ref> The films had music only during the opening (the famous main theme from Swan Lake, which was also used at the beginning of other Universal horror productions) and closing credits, and during a brief sequence set at an opera. In 1999, [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score to accompany the film. The current DVD release allows access to this music.\n\nAt the same time as the 1931 Lugosi film, a [[Spanish language]] [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|version]] was filmed for release in Mexico. It was filmed at night, using the same sets as the Tod Browning production with a different cast and crew, a common practice in the early days of sound films. [[George Melford]] was the director, and it starred [[Carlos Villar\u00edas]] as the Count, [[Eduardo Arozamena]] as Van Helsing and [[Lupita Tovar]] as Eva. Because of America's movie industry censorship policies, Melford's ''Dracula'' contains scenes that could not be included in the final cut of the more familiar English version. It is also included on the Universal Legacy DVD.\n\nThe [[Universal Studios]] horror films made Dracula a household name by starring him as a villain in a number of movies, including several where he met other monsters (the most famous being the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'', in which Lugosi played Dracula on film for the second and final time.)\n\n=== Universal Studios productions of Dracula ===\n[[File:Dracula1931BelaLugosiColorCrop.jpg|thumb|Colored publicity shot of [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Edward Van Sloan]] in [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]] (Universal, 1931).]]The Universal Studios films in which Dracula (or a relative) appeared (and the actor portraying the character) were:\n\n# ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931 - [[Bela Lugosi]] (collectively the most famous interpretation)) (a [[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|second version]] was filmed at the same time in Spanish, with [[Carlos Villar\u00edas]] as Dracula)\n# ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936 - [[Gloria Holden]])\n# ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943 - [[Lon Chaney Jr.]])\n# ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944 - [[John Carradine]])\n# ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945 - Carradine)\n# ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948 - Lugosi)\n# ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'' (1979 - [[Frank Langella]])\n\n=== Hammer Films productions of Dracula ===\n{{main|Dracula (Hammer film series)}}\n[[File:Dracula 1958 c.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christopher Lee]] as [[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]] in the 1958 [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] remake.]]\nIn 1958, [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] produced ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'', a newer, more cinematic Gothic version of the story, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as Count Dracula and [[Peter Cushing]] as Doctor Van Helsing. In 2004 it was named by ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine as the 30th-greatest British film of all time. Although it takes many liberties with the novel's plot, the creepy atmosphere and charismatic performances of Lee and Cushing make it memorable. It was released in the United States as ''Horror of Dracula'' to avoid confusion with the earlier [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Lugosi version]]. This was followed by a long series of Dracula films, usually featuring Lee as the Count.

It was the first sound film to depict Dracula with fangs.\n\n''[[Blood of Dracula]]'' (1957) was producer Herman Cohen's attempt to cash in on his previous success with ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''. The film was basically \"I Was a Teenage Vampire\", with the same story of a wayward teenager (Sandra Harrison) being transformed into a legendary fiend by an ill-willed adult (Louise Lewis). [[Herbert L. Strock]] directed.\n\n''[[The Return of Dracula]]'' (1958) brought the Count to modern day America. Matinee idol [[Francis Lederer]] played Dracula, who flees vampire hunters in Transylvania to take up residence in small-town America in the guise of an artist he had previously murdered. The Count begins to feed on the local populace and create more vampires before he is tracked to his lair in an abandoned mine and destroyed. Paul Landres directed from a screenplay by Pat Fielder. The film is also known, for some reason, as ''The Fantastic Disappearing Man'' in the U.K.. It has been shown on U.S. television under the title ''Curse of Dracula''.\n\n''[[Batman Dracula]]'' (1964) is a black and white American film produced and directed by Andy Warhol, without the permission of DC Comics.\n\n''[[Billy the Kid Versus Dracula]]'' (1966) saw the Count in America's Old West, facing off with a pre-outlaw years Billy the Kid.

In spite of its star, Franco's film is not a part of the Hammer series and was shot on a small budget. Lee is made up to look like the description of the Count from Stoker's novel and he does seem to grow younger as the story progresses, but the film otherwise takes some huge liberties with the plot. The international cast includes [[Herbert Lom]] as Van Helsing and [[Klaus Kinski]] as Renfield.\n\nJesus Franco followed this with ''[[Vampyros Lesbos]]'' in 1971, in which [[Soledad Miranda]] plays Nadina, a descendant of the Dracula family.\n\n''[[Cuadecuc, vampir]]'' is a 1970 experimental film by Spanish filmmaker Pere Portabella.

Stoker's production, which Lyceum actor/manager Henry Irving reportedly pronounced \"Dreadful!\", was called ''[[Dracula (Stoker play)|Dracula, or The Un-Dead]]'' and took place on May 18, 1897, preceding the novel's publication by eight days. The unwieldy manuscript took fifteen actors over four hours to perform.\n*In 1924, with the permission of the Stoker estate, the story was adapted for the stage a second time by [[Hamilton Deane]]. Titled ''[[Dracula (1924 play)|Dracula, The Vampire Play]]'' the English touring production starred Deane himself as Van Helsing. In 1927, the play, as substantially revised by [[John L.

It featured [[Denholm Elliott]] as Dracula.\n* In 1971, ''Hrab\u011b Drakula'', directed by Anna Proch\u00e1zkov\u00e1, was broadcast on Czechoslovakia television. It was reasonably faithful to the novel, except for the exclusion of Renfield.

It starred [[Norman Welsh]] as Dracula.\n* In 1973, ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1973 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', starring [[Jack Palance]], was produced by [[Dan Curtis]], best known for producing the gothic [[soap opera]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', and who worked from a script by sci-fi favorite [[Richard Matheson]]. Filmed in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and England, it was relatively faithful to the novel, though it tried to paint Dracula as a tragic, rather than evil, character in search of his lost love. It also drew the connection between Dracula and the historical figure of [[Vlad the Impaler]], which was a popular notion at the time (see above). In these respects, it is also a close forerunner of Coppola's later film.\n* 1977 saw a BBC television adaptation titled ''[[Count Dracula (1977 film)|Count Dracula]]'' directed by [[Philip Saville]]. It starred [[Louis Jourdan]] as the Count and [[Frank Finlay]] as Van Helsing. This version is one of the more faithful adaptations of the book.

It starred [[Marc Warren]] as Count Dracula, who was brought to England by Arthur Holmwood in attempt to cure his syphilis, which made it impossible for Arthur to consummate his marriage to Lucy Westenra.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/dracula/] A page on the [[BBC]] official website about their film adaptation of Dracula</ref>\n* Dracula was portrayed as the lead character in [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s 2013-2014 TV series ''[[Dracula (2013 TV series)|Dracula]]''. This reimagining depicted Dracula (played by [[Jonathan Rhys Myers]]) posing as Alexander Grayson, an American entrepreneur who is willing to bring modern science to the [[Victorian-era|Victorian]] society. In reality, Dracula seeks revenge on those who had betrayed him centuries earlier. As his plans are set into motion, he falls in love with a woman who may be a reincarnation of his deceased wife.\n* A 2020 ''[[Dracula (2020 TV series)|Dracula miniseries]]'' for the [[BBC]], in partnership with [[Netflix]], from the creators of ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', [[Steven Moffat]] and [[Mark Gatiss]]. Dracula is portrayed by [[Claes Bang]]. In this version Dracula draws plans against Victorian London in XIX, but he gets stuck in his coffin under the sea after destruction of the ship ''Demeter''. Dracula finally reaches England in XXI, where he continues his battles with Van Helsing's descendant. This version of Dracula has special ability to learn new skills by simply drinking blood of the people and it's revealed later that all his traditional vampire weaknesses are in fact linked to his deep feelings of shame, his death wish and entirely self-imposed.\n\n===TV appearances===\n* ''[[The Munsters]]'' (1964-1966) featured \"Grandpa\" Sam Dracula, a vampire, who identifies himself as being ''the'' Count Dracula in one episode, although he has found a way to sustain himself without blood and is no longer vulnerable to sunlight. He is portrayed as a friendlier mad scientist-type. He still retains his abilities to turn into a wolf or a bat. Instead of the quasi-Eastern European accent usually associated with Dracula, Grandpa Munster speaks with a Brooklyn accent.\n* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story \"[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]\" (1965), [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], his companions and the Daleks came across Dracula and Frankenstein's monster, although later both were shown to be robots.\n* ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', \"Up At Bat\" (1966) - After being bitten by a supposed vampire bat, Gilligan believes he is turning into a vampire.

He is more similar in appearance to [[Blacula]].\n* Cartoon vampires based upon Dracula also include:\n** [[Cosgrove Hall]]'s ''[[Count Duckula]]''.\n** [[Filmation]]'s ''Quackula''. Not to be confused with the above character.\n** [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|Count Chocula]], the animated mascot of the [[breakfast cereal]] of the same name.\n** Dingbat the Vampire Dog ([[Frank Welker]]), from the \"Dingbat and the Creeps\" segment of ''[[Heathcliff (1980 TV series)|Heathcliff and Dingbat]]'', was also a parody of Dracula.\n** In the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series ''[[Gravedale High]]'', a cool teenage vampire named Vinnie Stoker is suggested to be Dracula's son.\n** In the ''Monster Tails'' animated segment on the live-action show ''[[Wake, Rattle, and Roll]]'', also from Hanna-Barbera, Dracula's cat Catula (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is loosely based on his master.\n** In the segment called \"Mini-Monsters\" on the [[Rankin-Bass]] cartoon series ''[[The Comic Strip]]'', Dracky is Dracula's son.\n** A similar character named Count Drakeula appeared in an episode of [[Disney]]'s ''[[DuckTales]]''.\n** \"Drac\" was one of the main characters of the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[Groovie Ghoulies|The Groovie Goolies]]''.\n* Dracula appears as the character called Vlad the Count (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) in the American animated short television series called ''[[Mina and the Count]]'' about a seven-year-old girl named Mina Harper and her encounters with Vlad, a 700-year-old vampire.\n* Dracula was parodied on ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' as the villain named Count Spankulot (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]). Instead of sucking blood, he spanks naughty children. He can turn people into vampires by spanking them with one of his gloves off and can only be turned back to normal if he ''himself'' is spanked. His home is never seen in the series. He can fly without changing into a [[Bat (animal)|bat]].\n* ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'' features Dracula (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) as a recurring character. He is portrayed as an elderly and cantankerous African-American vampire who lives in a retirement home for older monsters and is the paternal grandfather of main character Irwin. This version more closely resembles [[Blacula]] and his voice and characterization are based on [[Redd Foxx]].\n* In a few episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Count Dracula is seen attending meetings of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], usually drinking blood (or some red liquid) from a goblet, and seated alongside such characters as [[Montgomery Burns]], [[Krusty the Clown]] and [[Julius Hibbert]]. Dracula is portrayed as Mr. Burns in the segment \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" of \"[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]\". In \"[[Treehouse of Horror XX]]\", he appears in the opening segments as a monster who is not cool anymore and in \"[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]\", in the vampire section of town, different vampires from popular culture are present, including Dracula from the 1992 film.\n* The cartoon series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' features a recurring television program called ''Assisted Living Dracula'' which features an elderly Dracula's ([[Don Kennedy]]) life in a retirement home. In one episode, the real Dracula visits [[MC Pee Pants]] in his latest incarnation as an old man named Little Brittle and bites him. MC Pee Pants leaves the hospital as a newly made vampire, only to die from exposure to sunlight. Dracula suffers the same fate.\n* In the 1990s there was a cartoon about Dracula's family called ''[[Little Dracula]]''.

The TV movie ''[[The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone]]'' (1979) depicts the count interpreting [[Wilma Flintstone]] as his bride, much like how he views Mina in Bram Stoker's novel.\n* Dracula appeared as the titular character in the direct-to-video movie ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'' (2005). He had been killed in the past, but was accidentally revived by the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. In this media adaption, Dracula is depicted as one of the stronger supervillains that [[Batman]] has had to fight, being able to fly, and possesses great super-speed and -strength; his reliance on his powers proves to be his undoing, due to the fact that he has underestimated Batman's intellect and cunning, in which he is able to restore Dracula's victims into humans again with an anti-vampirism vaccine he synthesized and kills him after he lures Dracula into a trap built with a solar generator.\n* ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'' featured an episode titled \"Count Koopula\", which, as the title suggests, featured [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a vampire who sucked on tomato sauce instead of blood.

In the third part, Dracula emerges to help combat a terrorist threat on a plane after interrogating the suspects. After taking out the terrorists and dropping the bomb on Van Helsing's house, Dracula calls his boss to inform them that the bomb is no more, yet the passengers are dead. When the flight attendant tells Dracula that she and the passengers are not dead, Dracula turns his attention toward them.\n* The character \"Count Blah\" from the fictional \"Sweetknuckle Junction\" from ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' was a spoof of Dracula, but more accurately a spoof of ''[[Sesame Street]]'''s Count von Count, who, Blah said, was actually from Brooklyn.\n* Count Dracula appears as a villain on ''[[Super Friends]]'' in an episode titled \"Attack of the Vampire\", originally released on October 14, 1978. In the episode, Dracula arises and tries to turn the whole Earth's population into vampires. The Super Friends battle Dracula, who transforms [[Superman]] and the [[Wonder Twins]] into vampires. Instead of biting them, Dracula uses intense beams from his eyes to transform his victims into vampires.\n* Dracula appeared as the narrator in an episode of ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes]]''.\n* Dracula is featured alongside the [[Mummy]], the [[Creature from the Black Lagoon]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster]] in ''[[Monster Force]]''\n* ''[[Monster High]]'', a Mattel fashion line of dolls and related series, features Draculaura, daughter of Dracula; she is a vegan vampire.\n* In the episode, \"[[I Dated a Robot]]\" of the third season of ''[[Futurama]]'', Count Dracula appears only to shout BLEH! before exploding.\n*Count Dracula appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' voiced by [[Allen Swift]].

The novel ''[[Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula|Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula; or, The Adventure of the Sanguinary Count]]'' by [[Loren D. Estleman]] features Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson becoming involved in the confrontation with Dracula, told as though the two were dealing with Dracula when he was not confronting Van Helsing's crew (although Holmes and Watson were not part of Van Helsing's core group, as the professor feared the extra publicity the detectives might attract to their cause).\n\nIn ''The Diaries of the Family Dracul'', a trilogy by [[Jeanne Kalogridis]], Vlad's relationship with his mortal descendants is explored, as are the specific terms of his vampiric curse and his pact with the Romanian peasants who serve him. The novels are written in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] form and the story is intertwined with that of Stoker's novel, as well as events from the life of Vlad the Impaler, expanding on minor characters and details from the Dracula mythos and Romanian history and culture.\n\n[[Elizabeth Kostova]]'s 2005 novel ''[[The Historian]]'' follows several historians whose research has led them too close to Dracula as they hunt the vampire across Europe.\n\n[[Meg Cabot]]'s 2010 novel ''Insatiable'' has a main character named Meena Harper who has a relationship with Dracula's son, Lucien.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megcabot.com/insatiable/|title=Insatiable Series - Author Meg Cabot|website=www.megcabot.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the book series ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'', which takes place 10,000 years in the future, D's adversary Count Magnus discovers that D is the son of Dracula, who is referred to as \"the Sacred Ancestor\" in the series.\n\n[[Freda Warrington]]'s ''[[Dracula the Undead (book)|Dracula the Undead]]'' is an unofficial sequel to ''Dracula''.\n\n[[Will Hill]]'s ''[[Department 19]]'' is about Jamie Carpenter, a descendant of Henry Carpenter, Van Helsing's valet who saves Van Helsing's life multiple times. Department 19 (or Blacklight), is an organization started by the people from the original ''Dracula'', and they fight vampires across the world.\n\n[[Dacre Stoker]], who is a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, co-wrote with screenwriter [[Ian Holt]] a sequel to ''Dracula'' titled ''[[Dracula the Un-dead]]'' (Stoker's original title), which reveals that Dracula was not actually the true villain, but sought to eliminate the more dangerous [[Elizabeth Bathory]], the storyline also revealing that Quincey Harker is actually the son of Mina and Dracula and ending with the death of all the characters while the sole survivor, Quincey, is last seen boarding the ''R.M.S. Titanic'' on her maiden voyage.

Latham]] takes an unconventional interpretation of the original novel when [[Sherlock Holmes]] is hired by his brother [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] to investigate Dracula's death. In the course of the novel, Holmes confirms that Dracula was not a vampire, but in reality his death was part of a complex plan orchestrated by Van Helsing; a former German agent, Van Helsing was acquainted with Dracula in their youth, but after Dracula had an affair with Van Helsing's wife that resulted in the birth of a son, the son was given up for adoption to become [[Arthur Holmwood]] and Dracula was told that he was dead. In the course of the novel, Holmes determines that Van Helsing set up various complex deceptions to create the illusion of Dracula as a vampire, killed Quincey Morris because he realized the truth, hired an actress to pose as the vampire Lucy to reinforce his deception and blackmailed Jonathan and Mina to assist him due to their role in the death of Jonathan's employer Mr. Hawkins, while Renfield was the solicitor who was actually sent to Dracula's castle and driven insane by Dracula's manner. At the conclusion of the novel, the Harkers have been arrested, Holmwood is psychologically broken and Van Helsing commits suicide to escape a trial after he is caught by Holmes and Watson.\n\n''Vlad: The Last Confession'' by [[Chris Humphreys]] mixes myth and historical facts. The novel retraces the life of the historical figure of Vlad III who inspired the Dracula legend. While the story is based on the historical 15th century ruler of [[Wallachia]], it also draws inspiration from the vampire legends that surround the Wallachian Prince.\n\n[[Gabrielle Estres]]\u2019 novel ''Captive'' retraces the life of [[Vlad \u021aepe\u0219]], the Wallachian ruler who inspired Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''. The book combines historical facts and contemporary 15th century pamphlets with the vampire lore created by Stoker.\n\nA version of Dracula (who hates the name and is known as Vlad Tepesh) appears first as a supporting character in the ''Night Huntress'' series by [[Jeaniene Frost]], then in a more central role as the protagonist's love interest in the spin-off ''Night Prince'' series. He is depicted as a powerful master vampire who was turned by a vampire named Tenoch and has the ability to control fire and read human minds in addition to the abilities common to vampires.\n\n==Short stories==\n* Shepard, Leslie. 1977.

They concurrently published ''[[Dracula Lives]]'' (1973\u20131975) in their black-and-white magazine line under the [[Curtis Magazines|Curtis]] imprint, 13 issues followed by a separately numbered all-reprint annual. After the color comic ended with #70 (August 1979), the company utilized the exact title for another black-and white magazine (#1, October 1979), which was canceled as of its sixth issue (August 1980). Their version of the character would continue to be a presence in the Marvel Universe for many years thereafter, as recently as the 2006 [[X-Men]] crossover ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula]]''. Wolfman and Colan reteamed for a three-issue Dracula miniseries comic in 1998, titled ''The Curse of Dracula'', this time for [[Dark Horse Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpanddagger.com/pulpmag/rev_cursedrac.html|title=Pulp and Dagger -- Review|first=D.K.|last=Latta|website=www.pulpanddagger.com}}</ref> Although briefly killed in a recent storyline, Dracula was resurrected by the X-Men to help them defeat his son, Xarus, when he attempted to bring the vampires of the world together to turn the X-Men and other remaining mutants into vampires.\n*In 1992 a four-issue comic book adaptation based on the movie ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992) was released by the [[Topps]] company with art provided by [[Mike Mignola]] and a full script provided by [[Roy Thomas]].<ref>https://www.horrornewsnetwork.net/idw-brings-bram-stokers-dracula-by-mike-mignola-back-to-life/</ref>\n*In 1993, writer [[Don McGregor]] and penciller [[Tom Yeates]] produced the two-issue miniseries ''Dracula versus [[Zorro]]'' for [[Topps Comics]].\n*In 2003, Dracula was re-invented as the globe-trotting \"[[Osama Bin Laden]] of vampires\" in the [[Image Comics]] series ''[[Sword of Dracula]]''.\n*One of the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' books by [[DC Comics]] is ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', which features the caped crusader fighting Dracula, who has come to [[Gotham City]], forcing Batman to become a vampire himself to stop his foe.\n*The novel, and \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories#Dracula's Guest|Dracula's Guest]]\" are being adapted into comic form by [[Leah Moore]] and [[John Reppion]], for [[Dynamite Entertainment]], as a five-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''The Complete Dracula''.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/010930-Moore-Reppion-Dracula.html Moore & Reppion on 'The Complete Dracula'], [[Newsarama]], January 30, 2009</ref>\n*[[Victor Gischler]] wrote, Giuseppe Camuncoli pencilled and Marko Djurdjervic created the cover of the [[Marvel Comics]] published ''[[Death of Dracula]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37858/a-preview-marvels-new-death-dracula-comic|title=A Preview of Marvel's New Death of Dracula Comic|publisher=}}</ref>\n*In 2010, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] published ''Bram Stoker's Death Ship'' detailing the Count's voyage to England from the viewpoint of the crew.\n*''Dracula: The Company of Monsters'' was a series from [[Boom!

It was released on cable TV in North America by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] as ''Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vampyres-online.com/sovereign.html|title=Dracula: Sovereign Of The Damned|website=www.vampyres-online.com}}</ref>\n*In the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Hellsing]]'', the vampire [[Alucard (Hellsing)|Alucard]] is actually Dracula, who has become the servant to the [[Integra Hellsing|Hellsing family]], rather than being outright destroyed. His background story mirrors aspects of the presentation of Dracula's origins in ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''.\n*Dracula appears in the novel series ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]''. In this adaptation, Dracula is seen as a vampire god-king who deals out both life and death. Dracula does not appear in the ''Vampire Hunter D'' anime adaptations, however he is referenced. However, in the English dub of the anime, D, the titular central character, states that Dracula respected humanity and did not feed on innocent people.\n*The author of ''Vampire Hunter D'', Hideyuki Kikuchi, also wrote a novel that presents Dracula himself appearing in Japan sometime before the events of Bram Stoker's novel called ''Meiji Dorakyuu Den''. The book was released in the United States as ''Dark Wars: the Tale of Meiji Dracula'' and featured Dracula facing off with several citizens of Japan, who ultimately drive him away from Japan, presumably back to Romania, where he then lives out the events of Bram Stoker's novel.\n*The ''[[Digimon]]'' series depicts a Digimon named Vamdemon (renamed Myotismon in the English dub) who resembles Dracula as one of the main antagonists. Two other Digimon, an imp named Dracmon and his Ultimate form GranDracmon, are named after Dracula.\n*In the manga and anime series ''[[Shaman King]]'' one of the antagonists, named Boris Tepes Dracula, is a descendant of Vlad the Impaler.\n*The manga ''Endo Beast'', written by Riko Takahashi, features a character named \"Dracula\" living as a commoner with the name Daniel Illiescu. He is a wealthy businessman living in the fictional world of Kanaeda; instead of a castle Daniel resides inside a large chateau with a rich view of the countryside. He plays a key role in the manga sporting a dual personality as the kind, generous Daniel during the day time and at night turning into the evil, bloodthirsty Dracula.\n*The manga ''[[Dance in the Vampire Bund]]'' by [[Nozomu Tamaki]] features Mina Tepes as the ruler of the vampire world. The manga deals in part with her efforts to ease the tensions between the newly revealed vampire race and the humans who have to live alongside them.\n*The manga ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'' by [[Fujiko Fujio]] features Dracula as one of the main characters. Similar to the [[Wolfman]] and [[Frankenstein's monster]] in the manga, this character is presented as more comical and lighthearted and he also prefers to drink [[tomato juice]] than blood.\n*In the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga there is a minor antagonist named Count Dracula - who is a Vampire who uses the Muay Thai fighting style - in the anime this character is referred to as \"Fangs the Vampire\" or alternatively \"Dracula Man\". The ''Dragon Ball Z'' series' 12th movie ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn]]'' also features a vampire named \"Count Drac\" escaping from Hell with other villains. Additionally Vampire enemies appear in the game ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury]]'' - including two who directly referencing Dracula named \"Vlad\" and \"Nosferatu\".\n* In the light novel and anime series ''[[Fate/Apocrypha]]'', Vlad III appears under the title of \"Lancer of Black\". This incarnation places him as a \"Heroic Spirit\" or \"Servant\" fighting against the \"Red Faction\", which also employs other heroes based on historical figures, on an event called the \"Great Holy Grail War\". Incidentally, one of his abilities allows him to transform into the legendary vampire, however, he hates how the world portrayed him as a bloodsucking monster in matters that did not involve him in any way, staining his honor as well as the feats he had accomplished when he was alive, and would rather die than invoke said legend.\n\n==Music==\nDracula became a popular subject in music of different genres, from [[Pop music|pop]] to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and gained a big prominence in [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Metal music|metal]].\n\n*Dracula is mentioned in the novelty songs \"Dinner with Drac\" by [[John Zacherle]] and \"[[Monster Mash]]\" by [[Bobby Pickett]]. \n* The novelty song \"Batman, Wolfman, Frankenstein or Dracula\" by Canadian vocal quartet [[The Diamonds]] from their single ''Walkin' The Stroll'' (1959) deals with the narrator, whose girlfriend likes monsters and monster movies as they are the only thing that turns her on.\n* American rock band [[Alice Cooper]] has a song \"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\" about the inmate of a mental asylum from their album ''[[Love It to Death|Love it to Death]]'' (1971). The song's main character is named for [[Dwight Frye]] and is inspired by his character [[Renfield]] from the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''. \n* Song \"Nosferatu\" by American rock band [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]] from their album ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' (1977) is based on [[F. W. Murnau|Murnau]]'s silent film ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror]]'' (1922) . Notably, the heroine of the song is named Lucy, not Ellen - just like the heroine in the remake of Murnau's film ''[[Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht]]'' (1979), yet the song predates the movie by two years.\n* Song \"[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]\" by English post-punk band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], their debut single from 1979, merges actor [[Bela Lugosi]] with his character Dracula from the [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|1931 film]]. The song is often considered the first Gothic rock record and has been immensely influential on Gothic music and contemporary Goth culture.\n* American heavy metal band [[Helstar]] has a song \"Dracula's Castle\" on their album ''[[Burning Star (album)|Burning Star]]'' (1984). The first half of their album ''[[Nosferatu (Helstar album)|Nosferatu]]'' (1989) follows a storyline based on Bram Stoker's novel ''Dracula''.\n* Song \"[[Love Song for a Vampire]]\" is a [[synthpop]] [[ballad]] by Scottish singer-songwriter [[Annie Lennox]]. It was recorded as the theme song to [[Dracula (1992 film)|Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film adaptation of Dracula]] and used in the end credits of the film. The song was released on a single ''[[Little Bird (Annie Lennox song)|Little Bird]]'' in 1993 and became one of the most known and popular Dracula-related and vampire-themed songs.\n* [[Cradle of Filth]], a British [[extreme metal]] band whose lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films, has several references to Dracula in their songs. The line from Bram Stoker's novel \"''Listen to them the children of the night what sweet music they make''\" is used in the songs \"A Dream Of Wolves In The Snow\" from the album ''[[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh]]'' (1994) and \"Queen Of Winter, Throned\" from the EP ''[[V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein]]'' (1996). Their song \"Lovesick for Mina\", from the album ''[[Thornography]]'' (2006), deals with Dracula's obsession over Mina Murray.\n* Songs of [[Theatres des Vampires]], an Italian Gothic metal band, noted for their predominant theme of vampirism within their lyrics, have a lot of references to Bram Stoker's novel and to Dracula himself.\n* Finnish [[Gothic rock]] [[Gothic metal|metal]] band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] has a song \"I\u2019ve Crossed Oceans of Wine to Find You\" as a B-side track to their album ''[[Razorblade Romance]]'' (1999). The song is inspired by [[Dracula (1992 film)|Francis Ford Coppola's film]].\n*American heavy metal band [[Iced Earth]] wrote a song entitled \"Dracula\" on their 2001 album ''[[Horror Show (album)|Horror Show]]''.\n*A heavy metal song, \"Dracula\", appears on the 2001 album of [[Iron Maiden]] vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] titled ''[[The Best of Bruce Dickinson]]''.\n*The rap song \"Dracula's Wedding\" by [[OutKast]], from the album ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' (2003), is sung from the Count's point of view.\n*Song \"Satanic Rites of Drugula\" by English [[doom metal]] band [[Electric Wizard]] from their album ''[[Witchcult Today]]'' (2007) is about a strung-out Count being revived by dope smoke and administering drugs to his victims before getting high on their blood.\n* American singer [[Bea Miller]] has a pop rock song with hip-hop influences, \"Dracula\", from her debut EP album ''[[Young Blood (EP)|Young Blood]]'' (2014). \n* Norwegian musicians, singer [[J\u00f8rn Lande]] and guitarist [[Trond Holter]], released a rock opera concept album ''[[Dracula - Swing of Death]]'' (2015)  based in the storyline of Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n*Dracula appears at the end of [[Tom Lehrer]]'s song \"L-Y\" from ''[[The Electric Company]]'': \"You enter a very dark room and sitting there in the gloom...is DRACULA! Now how do you say goodbye?/Immediately, Immediately, Immediate L-Y! Bye-bye!\"\n* The London based band [[Happy Graveyard Orchestra]] has an art rock song, \"Dracula\", from their debut EP ''Insect Demo Tape'' (2013) - written by [[Ivan Perilli]], inspired by original Bram Stoker's book.\n* The American metalcore band [[Ice Nine Kills]] wrote the song \"Bloodbath and Beyond\" on their album ''[[Every Trick in the Book]]'' which is based on Bram Stoker's original Dracula novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-stories-behind-ice-nine-kills-every-trick-in-the-book-album|title=The stories behind Ice Nine Kills' Every Trick In The Book album|last=November 2016|first=Metal Hammer04|website=Metal Hammer Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Ice Nine Kills \u2013 Bloodbath & Beyond|url=https://genius.com/Ice-nine-kills-bloodbath-and-beyond-lyrics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/ice-nine-kills-album-every-trick-the-book-compliments-the-literature-its-writen-after|title=Ice Nine Kills' Album \"Every Trick in the Book\" Compliments The Literature It's Written After|date=2016-05-23|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==Games==\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f is one of the more mysterious elder vampires in ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''. An [[Autarkis]] of the [[Tzimisce]] [[Clan (World of Darkness)|Clan]], he has been present at many of the major events in the ''[[World of Darkness]]''. In the ''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]'' setting, he is the founder of the 'Ordo Dracul', a secretive organisation to which the player's characters may claim membership. Both games draw much from the novel ''Dracula'' and vampire legends in general.\n\nIn [[Conker's Bad Fur Day]] and its remake, [[Conker: Live & Reloaded|Conker: Live and Reloaded]], Dracula appears in the form of [[Count Batula]], a parody of [[Gary Oldman]]'s performance as Dracula in the 1992 film [[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]].\n\nIn the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series (known as \"Akumajo Dracula\" (Demon Castle Dracula) in Japan), [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Count Vlad \u0162epe\u015f Dracula]], as he is known in the series, is the ultimate source of evil that the others must confront, after adventuring through Dracula's castle. The other aspect in relations to the Count is his son, Adrian Fahrenheit \u0162epe\u015f, commonly known as \"[[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]\", who has dedicated his life to ensure the survival of the human race and the preventing of his father's tyranny. In the ''[[Lords of Shadow]]'' reboot/spinoff series, Dracula was once a holy knight named Gabriel Belmont who was turned into a vampire and claimed overwhelming power in the first game's ''Reverie'' and ''Resurrection'' DLC's. The trilogy portrays Dracula in a more sympathetic light as he was used by others to do dark things. So far the Lords of Shadow series are the only games in the franchise where Dracula is featured as the main playable character. Dracula is also a boss in the 2018 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', in which the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series was also prominently featured.\n\nNow-defunct software company [[CRL Group PLC|CRL]] produced a series of games in the 1980s featuring classic horror classics including Dracula. These were the first game titles in the U.K. to receive [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] certification (they were rated \"15\"), normally reserved for films and videos. There were two adventure games, ''Dracula: Resurrection'' and ''The Last Sanctuary''. Both took place after the novels end and continued Jonathan and Mina Harker's fight against the Count.\n\nCount Dracula appears in [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[Kings Quest II]]'', which was released in 1985. The hero of the game, King Graham, has to face Dracula in order to get the last of three magical keys and kills the vampire by driving a stake through his heart. However, Dracula or another vampire similar in appearance to him is in attendance at King Graham's wedding ceremony at the end of the game along with many of his other friends and enemies.\n\n''[[Dracula - Resurrection|Dracula: Resurrection]]'', ''[[Dracula: The Last Sanctuary]]'', ''[[Dracula 3 - The Path of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy]]'' form a series of adventure games published by [[Microids]] ([[Anuman Interactive]]).

In the ''Overwatch'' Halloween event's ''Tale of Dr. Junkenstein'' \"The Reaper\" appears as Dracula during the Endless Night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkYnc7pa4TQ&t=2s|title=Overwatch Seasonal Event - Overwatch Halloween Terror 2017|last=PlayOverwatch|date=10 October 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe mobile game ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'' has Dracula's human incarnation, Vlad III, appear as a 5-Star Berserker and a 4-Star Lancer-class Servant. His Berserker incarnation is described as \"an incarnation of calamity that mercilessly wields his powers as a vampire.\" He appears in the Orleans singularity as an ally of Jeanne d'Arc Alter and in Salomon as one of the Servants from the Orleans singularity.\n\n==Others==\nThe [[General Mills]] cereal mascot [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|Count Chocula]] is a vampire who craves Count Chocula cereal rather than blood. His title of Count is an allusion to that of Count Dracula's.\n\nThe association of the book with the [[Yorkshire]] fishing village of [[Whitby]] has led to the staging of the bi-annual [[Whitby Gothic Weekend]], an event that sees the town visited by [[Goth subculture|Goth]]s from all over Britain and occasionally from other parts of the world. In addition, the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] runs a fundraising [[bungee jumping|bungee jump]] event in the town every April named the Dracula Drop.\n\n''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine has published countless spoofs of Dracula. In one, appearing in the ''Mad Summer Special 1983'', on the inside front cover, a cartoon sequence drawn by [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]] shows Dracula attacking a hippie who has taken [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]; Drac staggers away, seeing colorful [[hallucination]]s including blood, [[bat]]s and such.\n\nIn the film ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'', composer Peter Bretter ([[Jason Segel]]), in a subplot, finishes his Dracula-themed rock opera titled ''A Taste for Love''.\n\nRussian authors [[Andrey Shary]] and Vladimir Vedrashko in 2009 published a book ''Sign D: Dracula in Books and on the Screen'' devoted in particular to Dracula image implications in Soviet and Russian popular and mass culture.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], discount store [[Poundland]] changes the voice of its [[Self-checkout|self-service checkouts]] to that of Dracula throughout the [[Halloween]] retail period.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.derrynow.com/news/watch-elvis-dracula-santa-entertain-customers-poundland-store-derry/255759|title=WATCH: Elvis, Dracula and Santa entertain customers at Poundland store in Derry|date=1 November 2018|work=Derry Now|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\nThere are several locations associated with Dracula and Bram Stoker related tourism in Ireland, Britain, and Romania.

''Dracula'' has enjoyed enormous popularity since its publication and has spawned an extraordinary vampire subculture in the second half of the 20th century. More than 200 films have been made that feature Count Dracula, a number second only to [[Sherlock Holmes]]. At the center of this subculture is the legend of [[Transylvania]], which has become almost synonymous with vampires.\n\nMost adaptations do not include all the major characters from the novel. The Count is usually present, and [[Jonathan Harker|Jonathan]] and [[Mina Harker]], [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]], [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]], and [[Renfield]] usually appear as well. The characters of Mina Harker and [[Lucy Westenra]] are occasionally combined into a single female role. Jonathan Harker and Renfield are also sometimes reversed or combined. [[Quincey Morris]] and [[Arthur Holmwood]] are often omitted or, occasionally, combined into one character.\n\n==Films==\n\n===Early adaptations===\nThere are reports of a 1920 Soviet silent film '''''Drakula''''' ({{lang|ru|\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430|italic=yes}}), based on Stoker's novel. The film would have predated the lost 1921 Hungarian film ''[[Dracula's Death]]'', and is thus claimed to be the first film adaption of ''Dracula''. Nothing regarding this film is known to survive; there are no known production stills, and there is very little information about this film available. Most sources agree that the existence of this film is questionable because no details appear to have survived, and its existence is not verifiable.<ref>Glut, Donald F. ''The Dracula Book'' (1975) (\"Other film versions of Dracula are reported to have been made about this time \u2014 one being Russian \u2014 but there is no real verification to substantiate these claims.\")</ref>\n\nOne of the first film adaptations of Stoker's story caused Stoker's estate to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. In 1922, [[silent film]] director [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] made a [[horror film]] called ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu: eine Symphonie des Grauens]]'' (\"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\"), which took the story of Dracula and set it in [[Transylvania]] and Germany. In the story, Dracula's role was changed to that of [[Count Orlok]], played by [[Max Schreck]].\n\nThe Stoker estate won its lawsuit, and all existing prints of ''Nosferatu'' were ordered destroyed. However, a number of [[copyright infringement|unlicensed]] copies of the movie survived to the present era, where they entered the public domain.\n\nThe 1931 film version of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' was based on the 1927 stage play dramatised, with the Stoker estate's endorsement, by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L. Balderston]] (see below); it starred [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Van Helsing, both of whom had originated their respective roles on the stage in the aforementioned play, along with [[Helen Chandler]] as Mina and [[Dwight Frye]] as Renfield. Directed by [[Tod Browning]], it is one of the most famous versions of the story and is widely credited with initiating the [[Universal Monsters|Universal]] horror film series of the 1930s and \u201840s. The 1931 Dracula film was an inductee of the 2000 [[National Film Registry]] list.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/</ref> The films had music only during the opening (the famous main theme from Swan Lake, which was also used at the beginning of other Universal horror productions) and closing credits, and during a brief sequence set at an opera. In 1999, [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score to accompany the film. The current DVD release allows access to this music.\n\nAt the same time as the 1931 Lugosi film, a [[Spanish language]] [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|version]] was filmed for release in Mexico. It was filmed at night, using the same sets as the Tod Browning production with a different cast and crew, a common practice in the early days of sound films. [[George Melford]] was the director, and it starred [[Carlos Villar\u00edas]] as the Count, [[Eduardo Arozamena]] as Van Helsing and [[Lupita Tovar]] as Eva. Because of America's movie industry censorship policies, Melford's ''Dracula'' contains scenes that could not be included in the final cut of the more familiar English version. It is also included on the Universal Legacy DVD.\n\nThe [[Universal Studios]] horror films made Dracula a household name by starring him as a villain in a number of movies, including several where he met other monsters (the most famous being the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'', in which Lugosi played Dracula on film for the second and final time.)\n\n=== Universal Studios productions of Dracula ===\n[[File:Dracula1931BelaLugosiColorCrop.jpg|thumb|Colored publicity shot of [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Edward Van Sloan]] in [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]] (Universal, 1931).]]The Universal Studios films in which Dracula (or a relative) appeared (and the actor portraying the character) were:\n\n# ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931 - [[Bela Lugosi]] (collectively the most famous interpretation)) (a [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|second version]] was filmed at the same time in Spanish, with [[Carlos Villar\u00edas]] as Dracula)\n# ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936 - [[Gloria Holden]])\n# ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943 - [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]])\n# ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944 - [[John Carradine]])\n# ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945 - Carradine)\n# ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948 - Lugosi)\n# ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'' (1979 - [[Frank Langella]])\n\n=== Hammer Films productions of Dracula ===\n{{main|Dracula (Hammer film series)}}\n[[File:Dracula 1958 c.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christopher Lee]] as [[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]] in the 1958 [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] remake.]]\nIn 1958, [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] produced ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'', a newer, more cinematic Gothic version of the story, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as Count Dracula and [[Peter Cushing]] as Doctor Van Helsing.

This was followed by a long series of Dracula films, usually featuring Lee as the Count.

Dracula finally reaches England in XXI, where he continues his battles with Van Helsing's descendant.

The room also featured a full-sized [[coffin]], in which a cast or crew member usually hid dressed as a [[mummy]] or as Dracula himself.\n* Count Dracula made two appearances in the live-action superhero show ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (1988-1992).\n* Dracula appeared in the self-titled 1990 syndicated series ''[[Dracula: The Series]]''.

Outside the canon, Dracula appears in ''[[Spike vs Dracula (Angel comic)|Spike vs Dracula]]'', which reveals that Dracula has connections to the Gypsy clan that cursed [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] with a soul. As established by his appearance in \"Buffy vs. Dracula\", he is an acquaintance of [[Anya Jenkins]], and Spike claims he is a sell-out of the vampire world, fond of magic and Hollywood. The vampire popularized by [[Bram Stoker]] in the novel ''Dracula'' is also used as a basis for the ideas in the show, primarily the methods in which vampires are killed.\n* In 2000 [[Rudolf Martin]] also held the starring role in TV movie ''[[Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula]]''. Shown on United States Networks on October 31, it tells the origins of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III, also known as Vlad Dracula, \"the Impaler\"]], who gave Bram Stoker's Dracula his name.\n* In several episodes of the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (2001-2010), the main character [[J.D.

In fact, he is a mutant vampire created by mixing his DNA with [[vampire bat]] DNA. Unlike in the novel, this Dracula is neither invincible nor undead, but he does possess superhuman strength and the ability to fly, and he also transforms some female characters into his vampire brides. His lieutenant is a ghoulish vampire called Bram, in homage to the original author. His nemesis is psychokinetic (and psychotic as well) vampire hunter [[Chris (Caminhos do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o)|Christiano Pena]], who is bent on destroying Dracula, even if he has to kill innocents to do so.\n* In a skit of ''[[Attack of the Show]]'' (2005-2013), Dracula reviews the 2008 film, ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', criticizing how [[Edward Cullen]] is not a true vampire.\n* In the ''[[Supernatural (season 4)|Season 4]]'' episode \"Monster Movie\" (2008) of the television series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', a shape-shifter being hunted by [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] hides under the guise of Count Dracula and considers Dean to be Jonathan Harker and a girl he met and fell in love with to be Mina.\n*''[[The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice]]'' is a 2008 TV film in ''The Librarian'' trilogy of movies starring Noah Wyle as a librarian who protects a secret collection of artifacts from Vlad Dracula and his vampire hordes.\n* An episode of the British TV series ''[[Demons (TV series)|Demons]]'' (2009) called \"Suckers\" tells the future story of Mina Harker and Quincy Harker.\n* Episode 50 called \"Bloodlust\" (2011) of ''[[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes|The Murdoch Mysteries]]'' concerns vampire-like attacks at the time of the first publication of Stoker's book.\n* Dracula is the main antagonist of the 3rd season of ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014-2016), where he is portrayed by [[Christian Camargo]] as a fallen angel and the brother of [[Satan|Lucifer]]. He poses as a kind and somewhat eccentric zoologist named Dr. Alexander Sweet in order to seduce Vanessa Ives, the series' protagonist, and use her power to take over the world.\n* Dracula is the main antagonist of ''[[List of Decker episodes#Season 3: Gregg Turkington's Decker Vs. Dracula (2015)|Gregg Turkington's Decker vs Dracula]]'' (2015), the third season of [[Adult Swim]] action spoof series ''[[Decker (TV series)|Decker]]''. Portrayed by Ralph Lucas (credited as [[James Dean]], as part of a metafictional storyline involving Dean faking his own death), Dracula has constructed a doomsday device called the Destructicon, and employs characters from the [[Universal Monsters]] roster as his henchmen; he is eventually defeated by the ghosts of the [[Three Stooges]] (all played by [[Mark Proksch]]).\n* [[Tricia Helfer]] plays gender-bent Dracula in season 4 of  ''[[Van Helsing (TV series)|Van Helsing]]'' (2016-), where she is portrayed as the Dark One who is the ruler of the vampire species.\n* Dracula appears as Vlad the Impaler in season 3 of ''[[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]'' (2018-), where he is portrayed by Michael Antonakos.

The series will be a contemporary reimagining of Dracula, as a family drama about empowered, immortal women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy \u2014 and their nontraditional family. Dracula is left for dead at his destroyed castle in the Carpathian mountains while his three vampire brides  \u2014 Cleo, Ren\u00e9e, and Lily \u2014 flee to start a new life together.<ref> https://deadline.com/2020/03/goran-visnjic-cast-dracula-the-brides-abc-drama-pilot-1202877192/</ref>\n\n==Animation==\nDracula has even been adapted for children's literature and entertainment, serving as the basis for several vampire cartoon characters over the years, although in the interest of creating child-friendly characters, the vampiric nature of the character is often understated or not referenced at all.\n\n* [[Chuck Jones]]'s 1963 short ''[[Transylvania 6-5000 (1963 film)|Transylvania 6-5000]]'' depicts [[Bugs Bunny]] tunneling into a castle owned by Count Bloodcount (who looks and sounds like Bela Lugosi's version of Dracula). The Count repeatedly tries to attack the unaware Bugs, but Bugs's casual utterances of magic words keep inconveniencing the Count.\n* The 1975 short ''[[List of The Pink Panther cartoons|Pink Plasma]]'', directed by Art Leonardi, has [[Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]] staying the night at Dracula's castle while hiking in Transylvania and being continually stalked by Dracula. There is no dialogue in this film, and the only sound Dracula makes is \"Bleh-bleh-bleh!\"\n* Dracula (or at least his portrayal by Bela Lugosi) is the basis for the [[Muppet]] character named [[Count von Count]] on ''[[Sesame Street]]''.\n* He was a recurring skit character (portrayed by [[Morgan Freeman]]) on ''[[The Electric Company]]''. He is more similar in appearance to [[Blacula]].\n* Cartoon vampires based upon Dracula also include:\n** [[Cosgrove Hall]]'s ''[[Count Duckula]]''.\n** [[Filmation]]'s ''Quackula''. Not to be confused with the above character.\n** [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|Count Chocula]], the animated mascot of the [[breakfast cereal]] of the same name.\n** Dingbat the Vampire Dog ([[Frank Welker]]), from the \"Dingbat and the Creeps\" segment of ''[[Heathcliff (1980 TV series)|Heathcliff and Dingbat]]'', was also a parody of Dracula.\n** In the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series ''[[Gravedale High]]'', a cool teenage vampire named Vinnie Stoker is suggested to be Dracula's son.\n** In the ''Monster Tails'' animated segment on the live-action show ''[[Wake, Rattle, and Roll]]'', also from Hanna-Barbera, Dracula's cat Catula (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is loosely based on his master.\n** In the segment called \"Mini-Monsters\" on the [[Rankin-Bass]] cartoon series ''[[The Comic Strip]]'', Dracky is Dracula's son.\n** A similar character named Count Drakeula appeared in an episode of [[Disney]]'s ''[[DuckTales]]''.\n** \"Drac\" was one of the main characters of the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[Groovie Ghoulies|The Groovie Goolies]]''.\n* Dracula appears as the character called Vlad the Count (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) in the American animated short television series called ''[[Mina and the Count]]'' about a seven-year-old girl named Mina Harper and her encounters with Vlad, a 700-year-old vampire.\n* Dracula was parodied on ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' as the villain named Count Spankulot (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]). Instead of sucking blood, he spanks naughty children. He can turn people into vampires by spanking them with one of his gloves off and can only be turned back to normal if he ''himself'' is spanked. His home is never seen in the series. He can fly without changing into a [[Bat (animal)|bat]].\n* ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'' features Dracula (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) as a recurring character. He is portrayed as an elderly and cantankerous African-American vampire who lives in a retirement home for older monsters and is the paternal grandfather of main character Irwin. This version more closely resembles [[Blacula]] and his voice and characterization are based on [[Redd Foxx]].\n* In a few episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Count Dracula is seen attending meetings of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], usually drinking blood (or some red liquid) from a goblet, and seated alongside such characters as [[Montgomery Burns]], [[Krusty the Clown]] and [[Julius Hibbert]]. Dracula is portrayed as Mr. Burns in the segment \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" of \"[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]\". In \"[[Treehouse of Horror XX]]\", he appears in the opening segments as a monster who is not cool anymore and in \"[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]\", in the vampire section of town, different vampires from popular culture are present, including Dracula from the 1992 film.\n* The cartoon series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' features a recurring television program called ''Assisted Living Dracula'' which features an elderly Dracula's ([[Don Kennedy]]) life in a retirement home. In one episode, the real Dracula visits [[MC Pee Pants]] in his latest incarnation as an old man named Little Brittle and bites him. MC Pee Pants leaves the hospital as a newly made vampire, only to die from exposure to sunlight. Dracula suffers the same fate.\n* In the 1990s there was a cartoon about Dracula's family called ''[[Little Dracula]]''. The title character's voice was done by [[Edan Gross]].\n* [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s two animated TV movies ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' (1988) and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'' (1989) feature two rather different versions of Dracula. The TV movie ''[[The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone]]'' (1979) depicts the count interpreting [[Wilma Flintstone]] as his bride, much like how he views Mina in Bram Stoker's novel.\n* Dracula appeared as the titular character in the direct-to-video movie ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]'' (2005). He had been killed in the past, but was accidentally revived by the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. In this media adaption, Dracula is depicted as one of the stronger supervillains that [[Batman]] has had to fight, being able to fly, and possesses great super-speed and -strength; his reliance on his powers proves to be his undoing, due to the fact that he has underestimated Batman's intellect and cunning, in which he is able to restore Dracula's victims into humans again with an anti-vampirism vaccine he synthesized and kills him after he lures Dracula into a trap built with a solar generator.\n* ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'' featured an episode titled \"Count Koopula\", which, as the title suggests, featured [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a vampire who sucked on tomato sauce instead of blood. Dracula himself appeared in a live-action segment of the series. Also, the ''Castlevania'' version of Dracula was a semi-regular character on ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'', albeit always referred to as the Count.\n* Dracula ([[Dan Castellaneta]]) prominently appeared on ''[[Animaniacs]]'' in a [[Yakko, Wakko and Dot]] segment titled \"Draculee, Draculaa\". He was even in the intro of the series.\n* In the 1980 Hanna-Barbera cartoon, ''[[Drak Pack]]'', Count Dracula is a good guy (reformed from evil) who is the \"official\" leader of the team (who calls him \"Big D\"). Drak, Jr. is his great, great + nephew.\n* Dracula appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Tubba-Bubba's Now Hubba-Hubba\" voiced by [[Mocean Melvin]]. In a three-part segment that parodies ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', Dracula was shown sleeping in his casket. In the third part, Dracula emerges to help combat a terrorist threat on a plane after interrogating the suspects. After taking out the terrorists and dropping the bomb on Van Helsing's house, Dracula calls his boss to inform them that the bomb is no more, yet the passengers are dead. When the flight attendant tells Dracula that she and the passengers are not dead, Dracula turns his attention toward them.\n* The character \"Count Blah\" from the fictional \"Sweetknuckle Junction\" from ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' was a spoof of Dracula, but more accurately a spoof of ''[[Sesame Street]]'''s Count von Count, who, Blah said, was actually from Brooklyn.\n* Count Dracula appears as a villain on ''[[Super Friends]]'' in an episode titled \"Attack of the Vampire\", originally released on October 14, 1978. In the episode, Dracula arises and tries to turn the whole Earth's population into vampires. The Super Friends battle Dracula, who transforms [[Superman]] and the [[Wonder Twins]] into vampires. Instead of biting them, Dracula uses intense beams from his eyes to transform his victims into vampires.\n* Dracula appeared as the narrator in an episode of ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes]]''.\n* Dracula is featured alongside the [[Mummy]], the [[Creature from the Black Lagoon]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster]] in ''[[Monster Force]]''\n* ''[[Monster High]]'', a Mattel fashion line of dolls and related series, features Draculaura, daughter of Dracula; she is a vegan vampire.\n* In the episode, \"[[I Dated a Robot]]\" of the third season of ''[[Futurama]]'', Count Dracula appears only to shout BLEH! before exploding.\n*Count Dracula appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' voiced by [[Allen Swift]]. This version is shown to be wearing a monocle. Count Dracula is among the monsters that Baron Boris von Frankenstein invites to the Isle of Evil in order to show off the secret of total destruction and announce his retirement from the Worldwide Organization of Monsters.\n*Count Dracula appears in ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'' (a \"prequel of sorts\" to ''Mad Monster Party?'') voiced again by Allen Swift. He and his son, Boobula, are invited by Baron Henry von Frankenstein to attend the wedding of [[Frankenstein's Monster]] and its [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride]] at the Transylvania Astoria Hotel.\n* Dracula appears in the episode 12 from [[Darkstalkers: Out of Shadows]] as uncle of Demitri Maximoff\n* Dracula appears in the 2012 CGI animated comedy film, ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'', voiced by [[Adam Sandler]]. Here, he has a daughter named Mavis (voiced by [[Selena Gomez]]) and a deceased wife named Martha (voiced by [[Jackie Sandler]]). \n* Dracula appears as one of the Minions' masters in a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy film ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''.\n* Dracula appears as one of the villains locked in the [[Phantom Zone]] in a 2017 3D computer-animated superhero comedy film ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.\n* The 2017 [[Netflix]] animated series ''[[Castlevania (TV series)|Castlevania]]'' adapts the version of Dracula (voiced by [[Graham McTavish]] and [[Naoya Uchida]]) seen in the [[Castlevania|video game series of the same name]].\n* Dracula appears in a 2017 German/British 3D computer-animated film ''[[Happy Family (2017 film)|Happy Family]]'' (voiced by [[Jason Isaacs]]).

His weakness is an aversion to cats.<ref>http://www.comicon.com/2019/04/15/love-death-and-robots-sucker-of-souls-analysis/</ref>\n\n==Novels==\nA prequel to [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula]], Robert Statzer's ''To Love a Vampire'' ({{ISBN|978-1721227310}}), chronicles Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]]'s days as a medical student, depicting his first confrontation with the occult during an encounter with Countess [[Elizabeth Bathory]] and her niece, [[Carmilla]] Karnstein. Originally published as a serial in the pages of ''Scary Monsters Magazine'' from March 2011 to June 2013, a revised version of ''To Love a Vampire'' was reprinted in paperback and Kindle editions in June 2018.\n\n''Makt Myrkranna'' (Powers of Darkness, 1901) by [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Valdimar \u00c1smundsson]] (10. July 1852 \u2013 17. April 1902), is a rewritten Icelandic version of Stoker's novel, and also contains an original preface written by Stoker himself. First appeared in serial form in the newspaper ''Fjallkonan'' (The Lady of the Mountain) between January 1900 and March 1901, before being published in book form later the same year.

The novel ''[[Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula|Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula; or, The Adventure of the Sanguinary Count]]'' by [[Loren D. Estleman]] features Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson becoming involved in the confrontation with Dracula, told as though the two were dealing with Dracula when he was not confronting Van Helsing's crew (although Holmes and Watson were not part of Van Helsing's core group, as the professor feared the extra publicity the detectives might attract to their cause).\n\nIn ''The Diaries of the Family Dracul'', a trilogy by [[Jeanne Kalogridis]], Vlad's relationship with his mortal descendants is explored, as are the specific terms of his vampiric curse and his pact with the Romanian peasants who serve him. The novels are written in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] form and the story is intertwined with that of Stoker's novel, as well as events from the life of Vlad the Impaler, expanding on minor characters and details from the Dracula mythos and Romanian history and culture.\n\n[[Elizabeth Kostova]]'s 2005 novel ''[[The Historian]]'' follows several historians whose research has led them too close to Dracula as they hunt the vampire across Europe.\n\n[[Meg Cabot]]'s 2010 novel ''Insatiable'' has a main character named Meena Harper who has a relationship with Dracula's son, Lucien.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megcabot.com/insatiable/|title=Insatiable Series - Author Meg Cabot|website=www.megcabot.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the book series ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'', which takes place 10,000 years in the future, D's adversary Count Magnus discovers that D is the son of Dracula, who is referred to as \"the Sacred Ancestor\" in the series.\n\n[[Freda Warrington]]'s ''[[Dracula the Undead (book)|Dracula the Undead]]'' is an unofficial sequel to ''Dracula''.\n\n[[Will Hill]]'s ''[[Department 19]]'' is about Jamie Carpenter, a descendant of Henry Carpenter, Van Helsing's valet who saves Van Helsing's life multiple times. Department 19 (or Blacklight), is an organization started by the people from the original ''Dracula'', and they fight vampires across the world.\n\n[[Dacre Stoker]], who is a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, co-wrote with screenwriter [[Ian Holt]] a sequel to ''Dracula'' titled ''[[Dracula the Un-dead]]'' (Stoker's original title), which reveals that Dracula was not actually the true villain, but sought to eliminate the more dangerous [[Elizabeth Bathory]], the storyline also revealing that Quincey Harker is actually the son of Mina and Dracula and ending with the death of all the characters while the sole survivor, Quincey, is last seen boarding the ''R.M.S. Titanic'' on her maiden voyage.

Latham]] takes an unconventional interpretation of the original novel when [[Sherlock Holmes]] is hired by his brother [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] to investigate Dracula's death. In the course of the novel, Holmes confirms that Dracula was not a vampire, but in reality his death was part of a complex plan orchestrated by Van Helsing; a former German agent, Van Helsing was acquainted with Dracula in their youth, but after Dracula had an affair with Van Helsing's wife that resulted in the birth of a son, the son was given up for adoption to become [[Arthur Holmwood]] and Dracula was told that he was dead. In the course of the novel, Holmes determines that Van Helsing set up various complex deceptions to create the illusion of Dracula as a vampire, killed Quincey Morris because he realized the truth, hired an actress to pose as the vampire Lucy to reinforce his deception and blackmailed Jonathan and Mina to assist him due to their role in the death of Jonathan's employer Mr. Hawkins, while Renfield was the solicitor who was actually sent to Dracula's castle and driven insane by Dracula's manner. At the conclusion of the novel, the Harkers have been arrested, Holmwood is psychologically broken and Van Helsing commits suicide to escape a trial after he is caught by Holmes and Watson.\n\n''Vlad: The Last Confession'' by [[Chris Humphreys]] mixes myth and historical facts. The novel retraces the life of the historical figure of Vlad III who inspired the Dracula legend. While the story is based on the historical 15th century ruler of [[Wallachia]], it also draws inspiration from the vampire legends that surround the Wallachian Prince.\n\n[[Gabrielle Estres]]\u2019 novel ''Captive'' retraces the life of [[Vlad \u021aepe\u0219]], the Wallachian ruler who inspired Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''. The book combines historical facts and contemporary 15th century pamphlets with the vampire lore created by Stoker.\n\nA version of Dracula (who hates the name and is known as Vlad Tepesh) appears first as a supporting character in the ''Night Huntress'' series by [[Jeaniene Frost]], then in a more central role as the protagonist's love interest in the spin-off ''Night Prince'' series. He is depicted as a powerful master vampire who was turned by a vampire named Tenoch and has the ability to control fire and read human minds in addition to the abilities common to vampires.\n\n==Short stories==\n* Shepard, Leslie. 1977.

They concurrently published ''[[Dracula Lives]]'' (1973\u20131975) in their black-and-white magazine line under the [[Curtis Magazines|Curtis]] imprint, 13 issues followed by a separately numbered all-reprint annual. After the color comic ended with #70 (August 1979), the company utilized the exact title for another black-and white magazine (#1, October 1979), which was canceled as of its sixth issue (August 1980). Their version of the character would continue to be a presence in the Marvel Universe for many years thereafter, as recently as the 2006 [[X-Men]] crossover ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula]]''. Wolfman and Colan reteamed for a three-issue Dracula miniseries comic in 1998, titled ''The Curse of Dracula'', this time for [[Dark Horse Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpanddagger.com/pulpmag/rev_cursedrac.html|title=Pulp and Dagger -- Review|first=D.K.|last=Latta|website=www.pulpanddagger.com}}</ref> Although briefly killed in a recent storyline, Dracula was resurrected by the X-Men to help them defeat his son, Xarus, when he attempted to bring the vampires of the world together to turn the X-Men and other remaining mutants into vampires.\n*In 1992 a four-issue comic book adaptation based on the movie ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992) was released by the [[Topps]] company with art provided by [[Mike Mignola]] and a full script provided by [[Roy Thomas]].<ref>https://www.horrornewsnetwork.net/idw-brings-bram-stokers-dracula-by-mike-mignola-back-to-life/</ref>\n*In 1993, writer [[Don McGregor]] and penciller [[Tom Yeates]] produced the two-issue miniseries ''Dracula versus [[Zorro]]'' for [[Topps Comics]].\n*In 2003, Dracula was re-invented as the globe-trotting \"[[Osama Bin Laden]] of vampires\" in the [[Image Comics]] series ''[[Sword of Dracula]]''.\n*One of the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' books by [[DC Comics]] is ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]'', which features the caped crusader fighting Dracula, who has come to [[Gotham City]], forcing Batman to become a vampire himself to stop his foe.\n*The novel, and \"[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories#Dracula's Guest|Dracula's Guest]]\" are being adapted into comic form by [[Leah Moore]] and [[John Reppion]], for [[Dynamite Entertainment]], as a five-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''The Complete Dracula''.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/010930-Moore-Reppion-Dracula.html Moore & Reppion on 'The Complete Dracula'], [[Newsarama]], January 30, 2009</ref>\n*[[Victor Gischler]] wrote, Giuseppe Camuncoli pencilled and Marko Djurdjervic created the cover of the [[Marvel Comics]] published ''[[Death of Dracula]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37858/a-preview-marvels-new-death-dracula-comic|title=A Preview of Marvel's New Death of Dracula Comic|publisher=}}</ref>\n*In 2010, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] published ''Bram Stoker's Death Ship'' detailing the Count's voyage to England from the viewpoint of the crew.\n*''Dracula: The Company of Monsters'' was a series from [[Boom!

It was released on cable TV in North America by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] as ''Dracula: Sovereign of the Damned''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vampyres-online.com/sovereign.html|title=Dracula: Sovereign Of The Damned|website=www.vampyres-online.com}}</ref>\n*In the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Hellsing]]'', the vampire [[Alucard (Hellsing)|Alucard]] is actually Dracula, who has become the servant to the [[Integra Hellsing|Hellsing family]], rather than being outright destroyed. His background story mirrors aspects of the presentation of Dracula's origins in ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''.\n*Dracula appears in the novel series ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]''. In this adaptation, Dracula is seen as a vampire god-king who deals out both life and death. Dracula does not appear in the ''Vampire Hunter D'' anime adaptations, however he is referenced. However, in the English dub of the anime, D, the titular central character, states that Dracula respected humanity and did not feed on innocent people.\n*The author of ''Vampire Hunter D'', Hideyuki Kikuchi, also wrote a novel that presents Dracula himself appearing in Japan sometime before the events of Bram Stoker's novel called ''Meiji Dorakyuu Den''. The book was released in the United States as ''Dark Wars: the Tale of Meiji Dracula'' and featured Dracula facing off with several citizens of Japan, who ultimately drive him away from Japan, presumably back to Romania, where he then lives out the events of Bram Stoker's novel.\n*The ''[[Digimon]]'' series depicts a Digimon named Vamdemon (renamed Myotismon in the English dub) who resembles Dracula as one of the main antagonists. Two other Digimon, an imp named Dracmon and his Ultimate form GranDracmon, are named after Dracula.\n*In the manga and anime series ''[[Shaman King]]'' one of the antagonists, named Boris Tepes Dracula, is a descendant of Vlad the Impaler.\n*The manga ''Endo Beast'', written by Riko Takahashi, features a character named \"Dracula\" living as a commoner with the name Daniel Illiescu. He is a wealthy businessman living in the fictional world of Kanaeda; instead of a castle Daniel resides inside a large chateau with a rich view of the countryside. He plays a key role in the manga sporting a dual personality as the kind, generous Daniel during the day time and at night turning into the evil, bloodthirsty Dracula.\n*The manga ''[[Dance in the Vampire Bund]]'' by [[Nozomu Tamaki]] features Mina Tepes as the ruler of the vampire world. The manga deals in part with her efforts to ease the tensions between the newly revealed vampire race and the humans who have to live alongside them.\n*The manga ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'' by [[Fujiko Fujio]] features Dracula as one of the main characters. Similar to the [[Wolfman]] and [[Frankenstein's monster]] in the manga, this character is presented as more comical and lighthearted and he also prefers to drink [[tomato juice]] than blood.\n*In the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga there is a minor antagonist named Count Dracula - who is a Vampire who uses the Muay Thai fighting style - in the anime this character is referred to as \"Fangs the Vampire\" or alternatively \"Dracula Man\". The ''Dragon Ball Z'' series' 12th movie ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn]]'' also features a vampire named \"Count Drac\" escaping from Hell with other villains. Additionally Vampire enemies appear in the game ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury]]'' - including two who directly referencing Dracula named \"Vlad\" and \"Nosferatu\".\n* In the light novel and anime series ''[[Fate/Apocrypha]]'', Vlad III appears under the title of \"Lancer of Black\". This incarnation places him as a \"Heroic Spirit\" or \"Servant\" fighting against the \"Red Faction\", which also employs other heroes based on historical figures, on an event called the \"Great Holy Grail War\". Incidentally, one of his abilities allows him to transform into the legendary vampire, however, he hates how the world portrayed him as a bloodsucking monster in matters that did not involve him in any way, staining his honor as well as the feats he had accomplished when he was alive, and would rather die than invoke said legend.\n\n==Music==\nDracula became a popular subject in music of different genres, from [[Pop music|pop]] to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and gained a big prominence in [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Metal music|metal]].\n\n*Dracula is mentioned in the novelty songs \"Dinner with Drac\" by [[John Zacherle]] and \"[[Monster Mash]]\" by [[Bobby Pickett]]. \n* The novelty song \"Batman, Wolfman, Frankenstein or Dracula\" by Canadian vocal quartet [[The Diamonds]] from their single ''Walkin' The Stroll'' (1959) deals with the narrator, whose girlfriend likes monsters and monster movies as they are the only thing that turns her on.\n* American rock band [[Alice Cooper]] has a song \"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\" about the inmate of a mental asylum from their album ''[[Love It to Death|Love it to Death]]'' (1971). The song's main character is named for [[Dwight Frye]] and is inspired by his character [[Renfield]] from the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''. \n* Song \"Nosferatu\" by American rock band [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]] from their album ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' (1977) is based on [[F. W. Murnau|Murnau]]'s silent film ''[[Nosferatu|Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror]]'' (1922) . Notably, the heroine of the song is named Lucy, not Ellen - just like the heroine in the remake of Murnau's film ''[[Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht]]'' (1979), yet the song predates the movie by two years.\n* Song \"[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]\" by English post-punk band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], their debut single from 1979, merges actor [[Bela Lugosi]] with his character Dracula from the [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|1931 film]]. The song is often considered the first Gothic rock record and has been immensely influential on Gothic music and contemporary Goth culture.\n* American heavy metal band [[Helstar]] has a song \"Dracula's Castle\" on their album ''[[Burning Star (album)|Burning Star]]'' (1984). The first half of their album ''[[Nosferatu (Helstar album)|Nosferatu]]'' (1989) follows a storyline based on Bram Stoker's novel ''Dracula''.\n* Song \"[[Love Song for a Vampire]]\" is a [[synthpop]] [[ballad]] by Scottish singer-songwriter [[Annie Lennox]]. It was recorded as the theme song to [[Dracula (1992 film)|Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film adaptation of Dracula]] and used in the end credits of the film. The song was released on a single ''[[Little Bird (Annie Lennox song)|Little Bird]]'' in 1993 and became one of the most known and popular Dracula-related and vampire-themed songs.\n* [[Cradle of Filth]], a British [[extreme metal]] band whose lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films, has several references to Dracula in their songs. The line from Bram Stoker's novel \"''Listen to them the children of the night what sweet music they make''\" is used in the songs \"A Dream Of Wolves In The Snow\" from the album ''[[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh]]'' (1994) and \"Queen Of Winter, Throned\" from the EP ''[[V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein]]'' (1996). Their song \"Lovesick for Mina\", from the album ''[[Thornography]]'' (2006), deals with Dracula's obsession over Mina Murray.\n* Songs of [[Theatres des Vampires]], an Italian Gothic metal band, noted for their predominant theme of vampirism within their lyrics, have a lot of references to Bram Stoker's novel and to Dracula himself.\n* Finnish [[Gothic rock]] [[Gothic metal|metal]] band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] has a song \"I\u2019ve Crossed Oceans of Wine to Find You\" as a B-side track to their album ''[[Razorblade Romance]]'' (1999). The song is inspired by [[Dracula (1992 film)|Francis Ford Coppola's film]].\n*American heavy metal band [[Iced Earth]] wrote a song entitled \"Dracula\" on their 2001 album ''[[Horror Show (album)|Horror Show]]''.\n*A heavy metal song, \"Dracula\", appears on the 2001 album of [[Iron Maiden]] vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] titled ''[[The Best of Bruce Dickinson]]''.\n*The rap song \"Dracula's Wedding\" by [[OutKast]], from the album ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' (2003), is sung from the Count's point of view.\n*Song \"Satanic Rites of Drugula\" by English [[doom metal]] band [[Electric Wizard]] from their album ''[[Witchcult Today]]'' (2007) is about a strung-out Count being revived by dope smoke and administering drugs to his victims before getting high on their blood.\n* American singer [[Bea Miller]] has a pop rock song with hip-hop influences, \"Dracula\", from her debut EP album ''[[Young Blood (EP)|Young Blood]]'' (2014). \n* Norwegian musicians, singer [[J\u00f8rn Lande]] and guitarist [[Trond Holter]], released a rock opera concept album ''[[Dracula - Swing of Death]]'' (2015)  based in the storyline of Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n*Dracula appears at the end of [[Tom Lehrer]]'s song \"L-Y\" from ''[[The Electric Company]]'': \"You enter a very dark room and sitting there in the gloom...is DRACULA! Now how do you say goodbye?/Immediately, Immediately, Immediate L-Y! Bye-bye!\"\n* The London based band [[Happy Graveyard Orchestra]] has an art rock song, \"Dracula\", from their debut EP ''Insect Demo Tape'' (2013) - written by [[Ivan Perilli]], inspired by original Bram Stoker's book.\n* The American metalcore band [[Ice Nine Kills]] wrote the song \"Bloodbath and Beyond\" on their album ''[[Every Trick in the Book]]'' which is based on Bram Stoker's original Dracula novel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-stories-behind-ice-nine-kills-every-trick-in-the-book-album|title=The stories behind Ice Nine Kills' Every Trick In The Book album|last=November 2016|first=Metal Hammer04|website=Metal Hammer Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Ice Nine Kills \u2013 Bloodbath & Beyond|url=https://genius.com/Ice-nine-kills-bloodbath-and-beyond-lyrics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/ice-nine-kills-album-every-trick-the-book-compliments-the-literature-its-writen-after|title=Ice Nine Kills' Album \"Every Trick in the Book\" Compliments The Literature It's Written After|date=2016-05-23|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==Games==\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f is one of the more mysterious elder vampires in ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''. An [[Autarkis]] of the [[Tzimisce]] [[Clan (World of Darkness)|Clan]], he has been present at many of the major events in the ''[[World of Darkness]]''. In the ''[[Vampire: The Requiem]]'' setting, he is the founder of the 'Ordo Dracul', a secretive organisation to which the player's characters may claim membership. Both games draw much from the novel ''Dracula'' and vampire legends in general.\n\nIn [[Conker's Bad Fur Day]] and its remake, [[Conker: Live & Reloaded|Conker: Live and Reloaded]], Dracula appears in the form of [[Count Batula]], a parody of [[Gary Oldman]]'s performance as Dracula in the 1992 film [[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]].\n\nIn the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series (known as \"Akumajo Dracula\" (Demon Castle Dracula) in Japan), [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Count Vlad \u0162epe\u015f Dracula]], as he is known in the series, is the ultimate source of evil that the others must confront, after adventuring through Dracula's castle. The other aspect in relations to the Count is his son, Adrian Fahrenheit \u0162epe\u015f, commonly known as \"[[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]\", who has dedicated his life to ensure the survival of the human race and the preventing of his father's tyranny. In the ''[[Lords of Shadow]]'' reboot/spinoff series, Dracula was once a holy knight named Gabriel Belmont who was turned into a vampire and claimed overwhelming power in the first game's ''Reverie'' and ''Resurrection'' DLC's. The trilogy portrays Dracula in a more sympathetic light as he was used by others to do dark things. So far the Lords of Shadow series are the only games in the franchise where Dracula is featured as the main playable character. Dracula is also a boss in the 2018 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', in which the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series was also prominently featured.\n\nNow-defunct software company [[CRL Group PLC|CRL]] produced a series of games in the 1980s featuring classic horror classics including Dracula. These were the first game titles in the U.K. to receive [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] certification (they were rated \"15\"), normally reserved for films and videos. There were two adventure games, ''Dracula: Resurrection'' and ''The Last Sanctuary''. Both took place after the novels end and continued Jonathan and Mina Harker's fight against the Count.\n\nCount Dracula appears in [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[Kings Quest II]]'', which was released in 1985. The hero of the game, King Graham, has to face Dracula in order to get the last of three magical keys and kills the vampire by driving a stake through his heart. However, Dracula or another vampire similar in appearance to him is in attendance at King Graham's wedding ceremony at the end of the game along with many of his other friends and enemies.\n\n''[[Dracula - Resurrection|Dracula: Resurrection]]'', ''[[Dracula: The Last Sanctuary]]'', ''[[Dracula 3 - The Path of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy]]'' form a series of adventure games published by [[Microids]] ([[Anuman Interactive]]). They were published in 2011, 2012, 2011, 2013 and 2013 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmosgaming.com/gaming-news/microids-announces-the-release-of-adventure-game-dracula-5-the-blood-legacy-on-pc-and-mac/|title=MICRO\u00cfDS ANNOUNCES THE RELEASE OF ADVENTURE GAME \"DRACULA 5: THE BLOOD LEGACY\" ON PC AND MAC - Cosmos Gaming|date=5 December 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''[[Dracula: Origin]]'' is a 2008 PC [[graphic adventure game|point-and-click adventure]] developed by [[Ascaron|Ascaron Entertainment]], in which the player assumes the role of Abraham Van Helsing in a storyline based on the original novel.\n\nCount Dracula, appearing as an anthropomorphic duck named Dracula Duck, appears as the final boss of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'', as well as the remake ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', Dracula appears as a skin for Reaper. In the ''Overwatch'' Halloween event's ''Tale of Dr. Junkenstein'' \"The Reaper\" appears as Dracula during the Endless Night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkYnc7pa4TQ&t=2s|title=Overwatch Seasonal Event - Overwatch Halloween Terror 2017|last=PlayOverwatch|date=10 October 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe mobile game ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'' has Dracula's human incarnation, Vlad III, appear as a 5-Star Berserker and a 4-Star Lancer-class Servant. His Berserker incarnation is described as \"an incarnation of calamity that mercilessly wields his powers as a vampire.\" He appears in the Orleans singularity as an ally of Jeanne d'Arc Alter and in Salomon as one of the Servants from the Orleans singularity.\n\n==Others==\nThe [[General Mills]] cereal mascot [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|Count Chocula]] is a vampire who craves Count Chocula cereal rather than blood. His title of Count is an allusion to that of Count Dracula's.\n\nThe association of the book with the [[Yorkshire]] fishing village of [[Whitby]] has led to the staging of the bi-annual [[Whitby Gothic Weekend]], an event that sees the town visited by [[Goth subculture|Goth]]s from all over Britain and occasionally from other parts of the world. In addition, the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] runs a fundraising [[bungee jumping|bungee jump]] event in the town every April named the Dracula Drop.\n\n''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine has published countless spoofs of Dracula. In one, appearing in the ''Mad Summer Special 1983'', on the inside front cover, a cartoon sequence drawn by [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]] shows Dracula attacking a hippie who has taken [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]; Drac staggers away, seeing colorful [[hallucination]]s including blood, [[bat]]s and such.\n\nIn the film ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'', composer Peter Bretter ([[Jason Segel]]), in a subplot, finishes his Dracula-themed rock opera titled ''A Taste for Love''.\n\nRussian authors [[Andrey Shary]] and Vladimir Vedrashko in 2009 published a book ''Sign D: Dracula in Books and on the Screen'' devoted in particular to Dracula image implications in Soviet and Russian popular and mass culture.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], discount store [[Poundland]] changes the voice of its [[Self-checkout|self-service checkouts]] to that of Dracula throughout the [[Halloween]] retail period.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.derrynow.com/news/watch-elvis-dracula-santa-entertain-customers-poundland-store-derry/255759|title=WATCH: Elvis, Dracula and Santa entertain customers at Poundland store in Derry|date=1 November 2018|work=Derry Now|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\nThere are several locations associated with Dracula and Bram Stoker related tourism in Ireland, Britain, and Romania.

The primary focus is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]] (a.k.a. G.&nbsp;W. Zoo) in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin claims to be an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic (whose real name starts as Joseph Schreibvogel and changes several times to eventually become Joseph Maldonado-Passage) says that she is simply a rival zookeeper who wants her competition shut down. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harrassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to suggest that Baskin was involved in the [[disappearance of Don Lewis]], her second husband, possibly in a homicidal capacity.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, especially his unofficial three-way [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] marriage with Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and his legal marriages to Maldonado and a third man, Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman in an attempt to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including: [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal park operator and alleged personality cult leader; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic.

Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Kelci \"Saff\" Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals.\n\nThe series received good reviews from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|section|date=April 2020}}\nThe series focuses on the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, exploring the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary focus is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]] (a.k.a. G.&nbsp;W. Zoo) in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin claims to be an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic (whose real name starts as Joseph Schreibvogel and changes several times to eventually become Joseph Maldonado-Passage) says that she is simply a rival zookeeper who wants her competition shut down. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harrassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to suggest that Baskin was involved in the [[disappearance of Don Lewis]], her second husband, possibly in a homicidal capacity.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, especially his unofficial three-way [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] marriage with Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and his legal marriages to Maldonado and a third man, Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman in an attempt to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including: [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal park operator and alleged personality cult leader; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.&nbsp;W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Kelci \"Saff\" Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

In 1631, he sailed much of the western [[Hudson Bay]] before concluding no such passage was possible. [[Foxe Basin]], Foxe Channel and [[Foxe Peninsula]] were named after him.\n\nHe left the Thames in May 1631 in the ''Charles'', took 20 days to work through [[Hudson Strait]], reaching the Bay on 11 July. Blocked by ice to the northward, he went south of [[Southampton Island]] to [[Roes Welcome Sound]] and south along the west shore to [[Port Nelson, Manitoba]] where he found [[Thomas Button]]'s winter camp of 18 years before, turned north-east, met [[Thomas James (sea captain)|Thomas James]] on 29 August, went north into [[Foxe Channel]] and into the lower part of [[Foxe Basin]], turned back at 66\u00b047'N, passed Hudson Strait in 10 days and reached England in October without any deaths among his crew.<ref>Glyn Williams, ''Arctic Labyrinth'', 2009, Chapter 4</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of Richard Fox, seaman and assistant of the Trinity House at [[Kingston-upon-Hull]], he was born at Hull 20 October 1586. He acquired knowledge of seamanship in voyages southward to France, Spain, and the Mediterranean, and northward to the Baltic, Denmark, and Norway, also working along the coasts of England and crossing the North Sea. In 1606 he offered his services as mate to [[John Knight (mariner)|John Knight]] for a voyage to [[Greenland]], but was rejected as too young.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fox, Luke}}</ref>\n\n==Greenland voyage==\nAfter Hawkridge's abortive voyage of 1619, Foxe became the successor of [[Robert Bylot]] and [[William Baffin]] (1615) in Arctic exploration. In the meantime voyages had been made by [[Sir Thomas Button]] in 1612, by [[Henry Hudson]] in 1606, after [[George Waymouth]] in 1585-7 [probably 1605]. Foxe's first patron was [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]], who with Sir John Brooke, directed royal attention to Foxe's voyage. The project first took shape in 1629, in a ''Petition of Luke Fox to the king for a small supply of money towards the discovery of a passage by the north-west to the South Sea, Hudson and Sir Thomas Button having discovered a great way, and given great hopes of opening the rest''. A [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]] of the [[Royal Navy]] of seventy tons was placed at the disposal of the adventurers, but the setting forth was deferred until the following year. In the interval Briggs died; half the adventurers having dropped out, the voyage might have been abandoned, but for news that [[Bristol]] merchants had projected a similar voyage from their port (under [[Thomas James (sea captain)|Thomas James]], leaving left Bristol 3 May 1631). London merchants, with [[Sir Thomas Roe]] and [[John Wolstenholme (merchant-adventurer)|Sir John Wolstenholme]], supported Foxe in the ''Charles'' pinnace with a crew of twenty men and two boys victualled for eighteen months.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFoxe sailed from the Pool below London Bridge 30 April 1631. He anchored off [[Whitby]], where he landed, and reached [[Kirkwall]] in Orkney on 19 May. Sailing due west on the sixtieth parallel he made land 20 June on the north side of [[Frobisher Bay]]; two days later he sighted [[Cape Chidley]], off the south shore of [[Hudson's Strait]], six leagues distant. Passing [[Resolution Island (Nunavut)|Resolution Island]] two leagues south on 23 June, his crew saw in the harbour on the west side the smoke of the camp-fire of Captain James, who had put in there for repairs. From this date until 11 July Foxe worked his way along the north shore of Hudson's Strait until he reached a position between Mill and Salisbury Islands.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFrom this point Foxe sailed south of [[Coats Island]] until 19 July, when he commenced his search for the [[north-west passage]]. On 27 July he reached the furthest point of Button's voyage, on [[Southampton Island]], where he found traces of native [[sepulture]]. Prohibited by his instructions from proceeding to a higher latitude than 63\u00b0 N. in this direction, he turned southward along the west shore of [[Hudson Bay]] until 27 August, when he entered the mouth of the [[Nelson River]], where he found the remaining half of an inscribed board erected by Button, which he replaced by a new one of his own. He sailed on E.S.E. sixty-one leagues until 30 August, when he met his rival, Captain James, in the ''Maria'' of Bristol, with whom, after some trouble in getting on board, he dined and spent seventeen hours.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFoxe then proceeded on his course down to 55\u00b0 14', later known as [[Cape Henrietta Maria]], at the head of [[James Bay]]. On 3 September he turned the head of his ship northward until he reached [[Cape Pembroke (Nunavut)|Cape Pembroke]] on Coats Island five days later. From 15 to 20 September Foxe made observations on the channel that bears his name on the west shore of what is now [[Baffin Land]]. On 22 September he turned homeward, among the numerous islands and sounds off the north shore of Hudson's Strait. Foxe found himself once more off Resolution Island, at the entrance to the strait. On 5 October he made [[Cape Chidley]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFoxe's course homeward was south-east to the [[English Channel]] instead of the shorter, but more dangerous one by way of the North Sea. On 31 October he came into the Downs with all his crew safe.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nFoxe was financially burdened after the voyage. He became a younger brother of [[Trinity House]], and died at [[Whitby]] in July 1635.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\nFoxe is best known for the work which contains the results of his voyage: ''North-west Fox, or Fox from the Northwest Passage . . . with briefe Abstracts of the Voyages of Cabot, Frobisher, Davis, Weymouth, Knight, Hudson, Button, Gibbons, Bylot, Baffin, Hawkridge ...

Prohibited by his instructions from proceeding to a higher latitude than 63\u00b0 N. in this direction, he turned southward along the west shore of [[Hudson Bay]] until 27 August, when he entered the mouth of the [[Nelson River]], where he found the remaining half of an inscribed board erected by Button, which he replaced by a new one of his own. He sailed on E.S.E. sixty-one leagues until 30 August, when he met his rival, Captain James, in the ''Maria'' of Bristol, with whom, after some trouble in getting on board, he dined and spent seventeen hours.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFoxe then proceeded on his course down to 55\u00b0 14', later known as [[Cape Henrietta Maria]], at the head of [[James Bay]]. On 3 September he turned the head of his ship northward until he reached [[Cape Pembroke (Nunavut)|Cape Pembroke]] on Coats Island five days later. From 15 to 20 September Foxe made observations on the channel that bears his name on the west shore of what is now [[Baffin Land]]. On 22 September he turned homeward, among the numerous islands and sounds off the north shore of Hudson's Strait. Foxe found himself once more off Resolution Island, at the entrance to the strait. On 5 October he made [[Cape Chidley]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nFoxe's course homeward was south-east to the [[English Channel]] instead of the shorter, but more dangerous one by way of the North Sea. On 31 October he came into the Downs with all his crew safe.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nFoxe was financially burdened after the voyage. He became a younger brother of [[Trinity House]], and died at [[Whitby]] in July 1635.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\nFoxe is best known for the work which contains the results of his voyage: ''North-west Fox, or Fox from the Northwest Passage . . . with briefe Abstracts of the Voyages of Cabot, Frobisher, Davis, Weymouth, Knight, Hudson, Button, Gibbons, Bylot, Baffin, Hawkridge ...

It was entered for the [[Stationers' Company]] 15 December 1634. It was accompanied by a large folded map of the Arctic regions.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nFoxe gave names to 27 locations during his voyages, eight of which exist in current usage.

At Harris' insistence (and despite Smith saying he was warned not to by the Lord) Smith reluctantly loaned the pages to Harris.

She had become partially deaf by the year 1827.\n\n'''Harris and the Book of Mormon'''\n\nEarly on during the translation of the [[Book of Mormon]] Harris became frustrated with her husband, Martin (and skeptical of [[Joseph Smith]]), because of how much he was helping Smith with the translation of the Book of Mormon. She questioned Joseph Smith personally about the plates and demanded to see them. He told her, \"he was not permitted to exhibit them to any one except those whom the Lord should appoint to testify of them.\" This did not resolve her concern and she persisted in demanding to see the plates.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110910211521/http://lds.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times-student-manual/chapter-four-a-period-of-preparation-1823-29?lang=eng The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]</ref> It has been suggested that she may have been enthusiastic about the translation of the plates, but \"her unrelenting determination to see them transformed her enthusiasm into resentment.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://lds-studies.blogspot.com/2010/09/lucy-harris-vs-joseph-smith-1829_4095.html|title= Lucy Harris vs. Joseph Smith: The 1829 Proceedings|last= Barker|first= Tim|date= September 30, 2010|website= LDS Studies|publisher= Blogger|access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn order to convince Lucy that they were translating an ancient book of scripture, Martin Harris asked Joseph Smith to instead let him borrow the [[Lost 116 pages|first 116 pages]] of the translation of the ''Book of Mormon''. Smith said that these pages of the translation of the Book of Mormon were a translation from the [[Book of Lehi]]. At Harris' insistence (and despite Smith saying he was warned not to by the Lord) Smith reluctantly loaned the pages to Harris. The manuscript was subsequently lost, and a variety of theories as to its disappearance have arisen.

Subsequently, Joseph lost the ability to translate \"for a season\" while he went through \"the repentance process.\"  Ultimately he claimed to receive a revelation wherein he was instructed not to retranslate the portion of the [[Golden Plates]] the 116 pages were taken from \"because wicked men had stolen the pages and altered them, hoping to discredit Joseph when he translated them again and the two manuscripts didn\u2019t match because of their alterations.\"<ref name=\"Richter 2012\"/> Instead, the material would be replaced with Nephi's Abridgment of his father's record.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|3}}</ref><ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|10}}</ref> However, according to [[Lucy Mack Smith]], Lucy Harris did give Joseph 28 dollars to go towards the translation and publication of the plates, claiming that she had received a vision testifying of their truth, as well as being shown the physical plates.<ref>{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Lucy Mack|date= 1845|title= Lucy Mack Smith, History|url= http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1845/127|location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= Lucy Mack Smith}}</ref>\n\n'''Later Life'''\n\nIn part due to the continued disagreement with her husband over the legitimacy of Joseph Smith and the golden plates, and because of the loss of his farm, which he had mortgaged to publish the Book of Mormon, in 1830 Harris and her husband separated.<ref>{{cite book |last= Cook|first= Thomas L.|date= 1930|title= Palmyra and Vicinity|url= https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/12090/dvm_LocHist002739-00106-0/209?backurl=https%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fsearch%2fdb.aspx%3fdbid%3d12090%26path%3d&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnBrowsing&rc=923,969,1190,1024;1189,965,1445,1022;2487,1123,2742,1185;624,1401,878,1458;877,1398,1122,1454;640,2705,894,2761;893,2700,1139,2757#?imageId=dvm_LocHist002739-00106-0|location= |publisher= Palmyra Courier-Journal|page= 206|isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Lucy Harris was described by her detractors Lucy Mack Smith as a woman of \"irascible temper,\" but Harris may also have abused her.

While light rail systems may share roads or have [[level crossing]]s, a metro system runs, almost always, on a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] exclusive [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], with no access for pedestrians and other traffic. And in contrast to commuter rail or light rail, metro systems are primarily used for transport within a city, and have higher service frequencies and substantially higher passenger volume capacities. Furthermore, most metro systems do not share tracks with freight trains or [[inter-city rail]] services. It is however not relevant whether the system runs on steel wheels or [[rubber-tyred metro|rubber tyres]], or if the power supply is from a [[third rail]] or [[overhead line]].\n\nThe name of the system is not a criterion for inclusion or exclusion. Some cities use metro as a brand name for a transit line with no component of rapid transit whatsoever. Similarly, there are systems branded light rail that meet every criterion for being a rapid transit system. Some systems also incorporate [[light metro]] or light rail lines as part of the larger system under a common name. These are listed, but the light rail lines are not counted in the provided network data. Certain transit networks may match the service standards of metro systems, but reach far out of the city and are sometimes known as [[S-Bahn]], suburban, regional or commuter rail. These are not included in this list. Neither are [[funicular]] systems, or [[people mover]]s, such as amusement park, ski resort and airport transport systems.\n\nThis list counts metros separately when multiple metros in one city or metropolitan area have separate owners or operating companies. This list expressly does not aim at representing the size and scope of the total rapid transit network of a certain city or metropolitan area. The data of this list should not be used to infer the size of a city's, region's, or country's [[urban rail transit]] systems, or to establish a ranking.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:World metro system cities.png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The locations of all the world's metro systems]]\n[[File:World Metro systems.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Countries shown in green have at least one operational metro system, while countries shown in yellow have at least one metro system under construction.]]\n; City: Primary city served by the metro system.\n; Country: [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign state]] in which the metro system is located.\n; Name: The most common English name of the metro system (and the connecting article for that system).\n; Year opened: The year the metro system was opened for commercial service at metro standards.

In addition, when one considers intracity lines of [[Japan Railways Group|JR East]] and private railway companies, [[Greater Tokyo]] (130 lines) has higher daily ridership than any other metropolitan area in the world with 14.6 billion passengers annually. The [[Osaka Municipal Subway]] also has only a minority share of all metropolitan railway ridership in Greater Osaka, constituting only 17.6% of Greater Osaka's 4.745 billion rail passengers annually in 2010. Including the municipal subway systems in both Kobe and Kyoto, the result still only comprises 22% of all rail travel in the Greater Osaka area with 1065.8 million passengers yearly ([http://www.mlit.go.jp/kisha/kisha07/01/010330_3/01.pdf MLIT Yearly Statistics]). For Greater Nagoya, the [[Nagoya Municipal Subway]] has only a minority share of all metropolitan railway ridership in Greater Nagoya constituting only 38% of Greater Nagoya's 1.095 billion rail passengers annually in 2010 ([http://www.mlit.go.jp/kisha/kisha07/01/010330_3/01.pdf MLIT Yearly Statistics]).

While light rail systems may share roads or have [[level crossing]]s, a metro system runs, almost always, on a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] exclusive [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], with no access for pedestrians and other traffic. And in contrast to commuter rail or light rail, metro systems are primarily used for transport within a city, and have higher service frequencies and substantially higher passenger volume capacities. Furthermore, most metro systems do not share tracks with freight trains or [[inter-city rail]] services. It is however not relevant whether the system runs on steel wheels or [[rubber-tyred metro|rubber tyres]], or if the power supply is from a [[third rail]] or [[overhead line]].\n\nThe name of the system is not a criterion for inclusion or exclusion. Some cities use metro as a brand name for a transit line with no component of rapid transit whatsoever. Similarly, there are systems branded light rail that meet every criterion for being a rapid transit system. Some systems also incorporate [[light metro]] or light rail lines as part of the larger system under a common name. These are listed, but the light rail lines are not counted in the provided network data. Certain transit networks may match the service standards of metro systems, but reach far out of the city and are sometimes known as [[S-Bahn]], suburban, regional or commuter rail. These are not included in this list. Neither are [[funicular]] systems, or [[people mover]]s, such as amusement park, ski resort and airport transport systems.\n\nThis list counts metros separately when multiple metros in one city or metropolitan area have separate owners or operating companies. This list expressly does not aim at representing the size and scope of the total rapid transit network of a certain city or metropolitan area. The data of this list should not be used to infer the size of a city's, region's, or country's [[urban rail transit]] systems, or to establish a ranking.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:World metro system cities.png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The locations of all the world's metro systems]]\n[[File:World Metro systems.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Countries shown in green have at least one operational metro system, while countries shown in yellow have at least one metro system under construction.]]\n; City: Primary city served by the metro system.\n; Country: [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign state]] in which the metro system is located.\n; Name: The most common English name of the metro system (and the connecting article for that system).\n; Year opened: The year the metro system was opened for commercial service at metro standards. In other words, parts of the system may be older, but as parts of a former [[light rail]] or [[commuter rail]] network, so the year that the system obtained metro standards (most notably electrification) is the one listed.\n; Year of last expansion: The last time the system length or number of stations in the metro system was expanded.\n; Stations: The number of stations in the metro network, with stations connected by [[Interchange station|transfer]] counted as one.\n; System length:The [[Network length (transport)|system length]] of a metro network is the sum of the lengths of all routes in the rail network in kilometers or miles. Each route is counted only once, regardless of how many lines pass over it, and regardless of whether it is [[Single track (rail)|single-track]] or [[Double track|multi-track]], [[single carriageway]] or [[dual carriageway]].\n; Ridership: The number of unique journeys on the metro system every year. There is a major discrepancy between the ridership figures: some metro systems count [[Transfer (public transit)|transferring]] between lines as multiple journeys, but others do not.\n\n==List==\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=no|}}\n{{selfref-inline|This list is sortable.

In addition, when one considers intracity lines of [[Japan Railways Group|JR East]] and private railway companies, [[Greater Tokyo]] (130 lines) has higher daily ridership than any other metropolitan area in the world with 14.6 billion passengers annually. The [[Osaka Municipal Subway]] also has only a minority share of all metropolitan railway ridership in Greater Osaka, constituting only 17.6% of Greater Osaka's 4.745 billion rail passengers annually in 2010. Including the municipal subway systems in both Kobe and Kyoto, the result still only comprises 22% of all rail travel in the Greater Osaka area with 1065.8 million passengers yearly ([http://www.mlit.go.jp/kisha/kisha07/01/010330_3/01.pdf MLIT Yearly Statistics]).

{"title_page": "Biolinguistics", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of the biology and evolution of language}}\n[[File:Palmarini Pio Manz\u00f9.jpg|thumb|Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]]\n'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the biological foundations of language first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the [[University of Arizona]]. At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was in effect the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. This organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language and the mind in general is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work that began in the 1950s as a reaction to then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which is that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was in effect the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. The term \u201cbiolinguistics\u201d was coined by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini at a 1971 international meeting at MIT, and the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

While Di Sciullo claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, the linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics originated in the 1970s, and that it is not synonymous with transformational grammar, but rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by Charles Darwin, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In  ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggested that different aspects of human biology that putitively contribute to language more than genes at play, for while they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguistics\u2014including Chomsky(ans)\u2014sometimes seem to imply. Contrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg approached language as a species-specific mental organ with non-trivial biological properties, which grows in the mind/brain of the child in the same way that (other) biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBase on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits (including language), or, put similarly, that genes can contain traits. Lenneberg then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon ontogenesis, criticizing prior hypothesis by Goodwin of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Recent Development ====\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language, in particular, is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters.

In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosemiotics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[Neurolinguistics]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n*[[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]\n\n===People in biolinguistics===\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

Initially only five positions long, the album chart was not published on a weekly basis, sometimes three to seven weeks passing before it was updated. A biweekly (though with a few gaps), 15-position Best-Selling Popular Albums chart appeared in 1955. With the increase in [[album sales]] as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 RPM singles and long-playing twelve-inch albums, with 78 RPM record and long-playing ten-inch album sales decreasing dramatically, ''Billboard'' premiered a weekly Best-Selling Popular Albums chart on March 24, 1956. The position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums. The first number-one album on the new weekly list was ''Belafonte'' by [[Harry Belafonte]]. The chart was renamed to Best-Selling Pop Albums later in 1956, and then to Best-Selling Pop LPs in 1957.\n\nBeginning on May 25, 1959, ''Billboard'' split the ranking into two charts ''Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs'' for [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] albums (30 positions) and ''Best-Selling Monophonic LPs'' for [[Monaural|mono]] albums (50 positions). These were renamed to ''Stereo Action Charts'' (30 positions) and ''Mono Action Charts'' (40 positions) in 1960. In January 1961, they became ''Action Albums\u2014Stereophonic'' (15 positions) and ''Action Albums\u2014Monophonic'' (25 positions). Three months later, they became ''Top LPs\u2014Stereo'' (50 positions) and ''Top LPs\u2014Monaural'' (150 positions).\n\nOn August 17, 1963, the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150-position chart called ''Top LPs''. On April 1, 1967, the chart was expanded to 175 positions, then finally to 200 positions on May 13, 1967. In February 1972, the album chart's title was changed to ''Top LPs & Tape''; in 1984, it was retitled ''Top 200 Albums''; in 1985, it was retitled again to ''Top Pop Albums''; in 1991, it became ''The Billboard 200 Top Albums''; and it was given its current title of ''The Billboard 200'' on March 14, 1992.\n\n===Catalog albums===\nIn 1960, ''Billboard'' began concurrently publishing album charts which ranked sales of older or mid-priced titles. These ''Essential Inventory'' charts were divided by stereo and mono albums, and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts. Mono albums were moved to the ''Essential Inventory\u2014Mono'' chart (25 positions) after spending 40 weeks on the ''Mono Action Chart'', and stereo albums were moved to the ''Essential Inventory\u2014Stereo'' chart (20 positions) after 20 weeks on the ''Stereo Action Chart''.\n\nIn January 1961, the ''Action Charts'' became ''Action Albums\u2014Monophonic'' (24 positions), and ''Action Albums\u2014Stereophonic'' (15 positions). Albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks, then were moved to an ''Essential Inventory'' list of approximately 200 titles, with no numerical ranking. This list continued to be published until the consolidated ''Top LPs'' chart debuted in 1963.\n\nIn 1982, ''Billboard'' began publishing a ''Midline Albums'' chart (alternatively titled ''Midline LPs'') which ranked older or mid-priced titles. The chart held 50 positions and was published on a bi-weekly (and later tri-weekly) basis.\n\nOn May 25, 1991, ''Billboard'' premiered the ''[[Top Pop Catalog Albums]]'' chart.

The albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963, when a ''Christmas Albums'' list was created. Albums appearing here were not listed on the ''Top LPs'' chart. In 1974, this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list.\n\nIn 1983, the ''Christmas Albums'' chart was resurrected, but a title's appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the ''Top Pop Albums'' chart. In 1994 the chart was retitled ''Top Holiday Albums''. As of 2009 the chart holds 50 positions and is run for several weeks during the end-of-calendar-year holiday season. Its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the ''Top Holiday Albums'' list and the ''Billboard'' 200.\n\n===Nielsen SoundScan===\nSince May 25, 1991, the ''Billboard'' 200's positions have been derived from [[Nielsen SoundScan]] sales data, {{As of|2008|lc=on}} contributed by approximately 14,000 music sellers. Because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than [[record labels]], it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] when [[Gold album|Gold, Platinum and Diamond album]] awards are announced (RIAA awards reflect wholesale ''shipments'', not retail ''sales'').\n\n===Incorporation of streaming data and track sales===\n{{see also|album-equivalent unit}}\nBeginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, ''Billboard'' updated the methodology of its album chart again, changing from a \"pure sales-based ranking\" to one measuring \"multi-metric consumption\".<ref name=\"2014change\"/> With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Beats Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Under the new methodology, ten track sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' will continue to publish a pure [[album sales]] chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on SoundScan's sales data.<ref name=\"2014change\"/>\n\nBeginning on January 18, 2020, ''Billboard'' will incorporate video and audio data from YouTube, along with visual plays from streaming services like [[Apple Music]], Spotify, [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], and [[Vevo]], into the ''Billboard'' 200. The change will also impact ''Billboard''{{'s}} genre-specific album charts.<ref name=\"Billboard 200 to Include Official V\"/>\n\n==Year-end charts==\n''Billboard''{{'s}} \"chart year\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for ''Billboard'' to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on an album's performance on the ''Billboard'' 200 (for example, an album would be given one point for a week spent at position 200, two points for a week spent at position 199... up to 200 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into an album's year-end total.\n\nAfter ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's best-selling albums, as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in March could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at number three in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years.\n\n==Uses==\nThe ''Billboard'' 200 can be helpful to [[radio]] stations as an indication of the types of music listeners are interested in hearing. [[Retailers]] can also find it useful as a way to determine which recordings should be given the most prominent display in a store. Other outlets, such as [[airline]] music services, also employ the ''Billboard'' charts to determine their programming.\n\n==All-Time ''Billboard'' 200 achievements (1963\u20132015)==\nIn 2015, ''Billboard'' magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing albums on the chart over the 52 years, along with the best-performing artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760797/adele-the-beatles-billboard-200-albums-artists-all-time |title=Greatest Billboard 200 Albums & Artists of All Time: Adele's '21' & The Beatles Are Tops |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=October 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009210944/http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760797/adele-the-beatles-billboard-200-albums-artists-all-time |archivedate=October 9, 2016 }}</ref> Shown below are the top 10 albums and top 10 artists over the 52-year period of the ''Billboard'' 200, through October 2015.

It is published weekly by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. It is frequently used to convey the popularity of an [[recording artist|artist]] or groups of artists. Often, a recording act will be remembered by its \"[[chart-topper|number ones]]\", those of their albums that outperformed all others during at least one week. The chart grew from a weekly top 10 list in 1956 to become a top 200 in May 1967, and acquired its present title in March 1992. Its previous names include the '''''Billboard'' Top LPs''' (1961\u201372), '''''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes ''' (1972\u201384), '''''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums''' (1984\u201385) and '''''Billboard'' Top Pop Albums'''.\n\nThe chart is based mostly on sales (both at [[retail]] and [[Music download|digital]]) of albums in the United States. The weekly sales period was originally Monday to Sunday when [[Nielsen Soundscan|Nielsen]] started tracking sales in 1991, but since July 2015, tracking week begins on Friday (to coincide with the Global Release Date of the [[music industry]]) and ends on Thursday. A new chart is published the following Tuesday with an issue post-dated to the Saturday of that week, four days later.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8071011/billboard-chart-magazine-dates-release-week-change|title=Billboard Chart & Magazine Dates Now to Align Closer to Release Week|magazine=Billboard|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref> The chart's [[Music streaming|streaming]] schedule is also tracked from Friday to Thursday.<ref name=\"tracking\">{{cite news|last=Billboard Staff |title=Billboard to Alter Chart Tracking Week for Global Release Date |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6851718/panic-at-the-disco-first-no-1-album-death-of-a-bachelor-billboard-200-charts |work=Billboard |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=June 24, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126063257/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6851718/panic-at-the-disco-first-no-1-album-death-of-a-bachelor-billboard-200-charts |archivedate=January 26, 2016 }}</ref>\n:Example:\n::Friday January 1 \u2013 sales tracking week begins\n::Thursday January 7 \u2013 sales tracking week ends\n::Tuesday January 12 \u2013 new chart published, with issue date of Saturday January 16.\n\nNew product is released to the American market on Fridays.

Initially only five positions long, the album chart was not published on a weekly basis, sometimes three to seven weeks passing before it was updated. A biweekly (though with a few gaps), 15-position Best-Selling Popular Albums chart appeared in 1955. With the increase in [[album sales]] as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 RPM singles and long-playing twelve-inch albums, with 78 RPM record and long-playing ten-inch album sales decreasing dramatically, ''Billboard'' premiered a weekly Best-Selling Popular Albums chart on March 24, 1956. The position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums. The first number-one album on the new weekly list was ''Belafonte'' by [[Harry Belafonte]]. The chart was renamed to Best-Selling Pop Albums later in 1956, and then to Best-Selling Pop LPs in 1957.\n\nBeginning on May 25, 1959, ''Billboard'' split the ranking into two charts ''Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs'' for [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] albums (30 positions) and ''Best-Selling Monophonic LPs'' for [[Monaural|mono]] albums (50 positions). These were renamed to ''Stereo Action Charts'' (30 positions) and ''Mono Action Charts'' (40 positions) in 1960. In January 1961, they became ''Action Albums\u2014Stereophonic'' (15 positions) and ''Action Albums\u2014Monophonic'' (25 positions). Three months later, they became ''Top LPs\u2014Stereo'' (50 positions) and ''Top LPs\u2014Monaural'' (150 positions).\n\nOn August 17, 1963, the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150-position chart called ''Top LPs''. On April 1, 1967, the chart was expanded to 175 positions, then finally to 200 positions on May 13, 1967. In February 1972, the album chart's title was changed to ''Top LPs & Tape''; in 1984, it was retitled ''Top 200 Albums''; in 1985, it was retitled again to ''Top Pop Albums''; in 1991, it became ''The Billboard 200 Top Albums''; and it was given its current title of ''The Billboard 200'' on March 14, 1992.\n\n===Catalog albums===\nIn 1960, ''Billboard'' began concurrently publishing album charts which ranked sales of older or mid-priced titles. These ''Essential Inventory'' charts were divided by stereo and mono albums, and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts. Mono albums were moved to the ''Essential Inventory\u2014Mono'' chart (25 positions) after spending 40 weeks on the ''Mono Action Chart'', and stereo albums were moved to the ''Essential Inventory\u2014Stereo'' chart (20 positions) after 20 weeks on the ''Stereo Action Chart''.\n\nIn January 1961, the ''Action Charts'' became ''Action Albums\u2014Monophonic'' (24 positions), and ''Action Albums\u2014Stereophonic'' (15 positions). Albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks, then were moved to an ''Essential Inventory'' list of approximately 200 titles, with no numerical ranking. This list continued to be published until the consolidated ''Top LPs'' chart debuted in 1963.\n\nIn 1982, ''Billboard'' began publishing a ''Midline Albums'' chart (alternatively titled ''Midline LPs'') which ranked older or mid-priced titles. The chart held 50 positions and was published on a bi-weekly (and later tri-weekly) basis.\n\nOn May 25, 1991, ''Billboard'' premiered the ''[[Top Pop Catalog Albums]]'' chart. The criteria for this chart were albums that were more than 18 months old and had fallen below position 100 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mitchell |last=Peters |title=New Chart Parameters for Billboard, Nielsen SoundScan |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003694233 |work=Billboard |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 8, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930165102/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003694233 |archivedate=September 30, 2008 }}</ref> An album needed not have charted on the ''Billboard'' 200 at all to qualify for catalog status.\n\nStarting with the issue dated December 5, 2009, however, the catalog limitations which removed albums over 18 months old, that have dropped below position 100 and have no currently-running single, from the ''Billboard'' 200 was lifted, turning the chart into an all-inclusive list of the 200 highest-selling albums in the country (essentially changing ''[[Top Comprehensive Albums]]'' into the ''Billboard'' 200). A new chart that keeps the previous criteria for the ''Billboard'' 200 (dubbed ''[[Top Current Albums]]'') was also introduced in the same issue.<ref>{{cite news|first=Gary |last=Trust |title=Billboard 200 Undergoes Makeover |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/266686/billboard-200-undergoes-makeover |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=November 17, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703041316/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/266686/billboard-200-undergoes-makeover |archivedate=July 3, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Holiday albums===\n''Billboard'' has adjusted its policies for [[Christmas music|Christmas]]<ref name=\"Xmas\">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047872/billboard-holiday-albums-chart-goes-live-early |title=Billboard Holiday Albums Chart Goes Live Early |work=Billboard |date=June 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |last=Taylor |first=Chuck |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330044538/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047872/billboard-holiday-albums-chart-goes-live-early |archivedate=March 30, 2013 }}</ref> and holiday<ref name=\"Xmas\" /> albums several times. The albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963, when a ''Christmas Albums'' list was created. Albums appearing here were not listed on the ''Top LPs'' chart. In 1974, this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list.\n\nIn 1983, the ''Christmas Albums'' chart was resurrected, but a title's appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the ''Top Pop Albums'' chart. In 1994 the chart was retitled ''Top Holiday Albums''. As of 2009 the chart holds 50 positions and is run for several weeks during the end-of-calendar-year holiday season. Its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the ''Top Holiday Albums'' list and the ''Billboard'' 200.\n\n===Nielsen SoundScan===\nSince May 25, 1991, the ''Billboard'' 200's positions have been derived from [[Nielsen SoundScan]] sales data, {{As of|2008|lc=on}} contributed by approximately 14,000 music sellers. Because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than [[record labels]], it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] when [[Gold album|Gold, Platinum and Diamond album]] awards are announced (RIAA awards reflect wholesale ''shipments'', not retail ''sales'').\n\n===Incorporation of streaming data and track sales===\n{{see also|album-equivalent unit}}\nBeginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, ''Billboard'' updated the methodology of its album chart again, changing from a \"pure sales-based ranking\" to one measuring \"multi-metric consumption\".<ref name=\"2014change\"/> With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Beats Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Under the new methodology, ten track sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' will continue to publish a pure [[album sales]] chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on SoundScan's sales data.<ref name=\"2014change\"/>\n\nBeginning on January 18, 2020, ''Billboard'' will incorporate video and audio data from YouTube, along with visual plays from streaming services like [[Apple Music]], Spotify, [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], and [[Vevo]], into the ''Billboard'' 200. The change will also impact ''Billboard''{{'s}} genre-specific album charts.<ref name=\"Billboard 200 to Include Official V\"/>\n\n==Year-end charts==\n''Billboard''{{'s}} \"chart year\" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for ''Billboard'' to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on an album's performance on the ''Billboard'' 200 (for example, an album would be given one point for a week spent at position 200, two points for a week spent at position 199... up to 200 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into an album's year-end total.\n\nAfter ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's best-selling albums, as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in March could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at number three in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years.\n\n==Uses==\nThe ''Billboard'' 200 can be helpful to [[radio]] stations as an indication of the types of music listeners are interested in hearing. [[Retailers]] can also find it useful as a way to determine which recordings should be given the most prominent display in a store.

{"title_page": "Terminal value (finance)", "text_new": "{{About|finance concept|other uses|Terminal value (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[finance]], the '''terminal value''' (also \u201ccontinuing value\u201d or \u201chorizon value\u201d) of a [[Security (finance)|security]] is the [[present value]] ''at a future point in time'' of all future cash flows when we expect stable growth rate forever. \nIt is most often used in multi-stage [[discounted cash flow]] analysis, and allows for the limitation of cash flow projections to a several-year period; see [[Forecast period (finance)]]. \nForecasting results beyond such a period is impractical and exposes such projections to a variety of risks limiting their validity, primarily the great uncertainty involved in predicting industry and macroeconomic conditions beyond a few years.\n\nThus, the terminal value allows for the inclusion of the value of future cash flows occurring beyond a several-year projection period while satisfactorily mitigating many of the problems of valuing such cash flows. \nThe terminal value is calculated in accordance with a stream of projected future free cash flows in [[discounted cash flow]] analysis. \nFor whole-company [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] purposes, there are two [[methodologies]] used to calculate the Terminal Value.\n\n==Perpetuity Growth Model==\n{{see also|Gordon Growth Model}}\nThe Perpetuity Growth Model accounts for the value of free cash flows that continue growing at an assumed constant rate in [[perpetuity]]; \nessentially, a [[geometric series]] which returns the value of a series of growing future cash flows\n(see [[Dividend discount model #Derivation of equation]]). \nHere, the projected free cash flow in the first year beyond the projection horizon (N+1) is used. \nThis value is then divided by the [[discount window|discount rate]] minus the assumed perpetuity growth rate\n(see [[Sustainable growth rate #From a financial perspective ]]): \n\n:<math>T_0 = \\frac{D_0(1+g)}{k-g}</math>\n* D<sub>0</sub> = Cash flows at a future point in time which is immediately prior to N+1, or at the end of period N, which is the final year in the projection period.\n* k = Discount Rate.\n* g = Growth Rate.\n\nT<sub>0</sub> is the value of future cash flows; here [[dividends]].  When the valuation is based on [[free cash flow to firm]] then the formula becomes <math>\n{\\left[\\frac{FCFF_{N+1}}{(WACC_{N}-g)}\\right]}\n</math>, \nwhere the discount rate is correspondingly the [[weighted average cost of capital]].\n\nTo determine the present value of the terminal value, one must discount its value at T<sub>0</sub> by a factor equal to the number of years included in the initial projection period. \nIf N is the 5th and final year in this period, then the Terminal Value is divided by (1 + k)<sup>5</sup> (or WACC).\nThe Present Value of the Terminal Value is then added to the PV of the free cash flows in the projection period to arrive at an implied [[enterprise value]].\n\nIf the growth rate in perpetuity is not constant, a multiple-stage terminal value is calculated. The terminal growth rate can be negative, if the company in question is assumed to disappear in the future.\n\n==Exit Multiple Approach==\n{{see also|Valuation using multiples|Relative valuation}}\nThe Exit or Terminal Multiple Approach assumes a business will be sold at the end of the projection period. Valuation analytics are determined for various operating statistics using comparable acquisitions. A frequently used terminal multiple is Enterprise Value/EBITDA or [[EV/EBITDA]]. The analysis of comparable acquisitions will indicate an appropriate range of multiples to use. The multiple is then applied to the projected EBITDA in Year N, which is the final year in the projection period. This provides a [[future value]] at the end of Year N. The terminal value is then discounted using a factor equal to the number of years in the projection period. If N is the 5th and final year in this period, then the Terminal Value is divided by (1+k)<sup>5</sup>. The Present Value of the Terminal Value is then added to the PV of the free cash flows in the projection period to arrive at an implied Enterprise Value. Note that if publicly traded comparable company multiples must be used, the resulting implied enterprise value will not reflect a [[control premium]]. Depending on the purposes of the valuation, this may not provide an appropriate reference range.\n\n==Comparison of methodologies==\nThere are several important differences between the two approaches.\n\nThe Perpetuity Growth Model has several inherent characteristics that make it intellectually challenging.  Because both the discount rate and growth rate are assumptions, inaccuracies in one or both inputs can provide an improper value.  The difference between the two values in the denominator determines the terminal value, and even with appropriate values for both, the denominator may result in a multiplying effect that does not estimate an accurate terminal value.  Also, the perpetuity growth rate assumes that free cash flow will continue to grow at a constant rate into perpetuity.  Consider that a perpetuity growth rate exceeding the annualized growth of the [[S&P 500]] and/or the U.S. [[GDP]] implies that the company's cash flow will outpace and eventually absorb these rather large values. Perhaps the greatest disadvantage to the Perpetuity Growth Model is that it lacks the market-driven analytics employed in the Exit Multiple Approach.  Such analytics result in a terminal value based on operating statistics present in a proven market for similar transactions.  This provides a certain level of confidence that the valuation accurately depicts how the market would value the company in reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the Exit Multiple approach must be used carefully, because multiples change over time.  Simply applying the current market multiple ignores the possibility that current multiples may be high or low by historical standards.  In addition, it is important to note that at a given discount rate, any exit multiple implies a terminal growth rate and conversely any terminal growth rate implies an exit multiple.  When using the Exit Multiple approach it is often helpful to calculate the implied terminal growth rate, because a multiple that may appear reasonable at first glance can actually imply a terminal growth rate that is unrealistic.\n\nIn practice, academics tend to use the Perpetuity Growth Model, while [[investment bank]]ers favor the Exit Multiple approach.  Ultimately, these methods are two different ways of saying the same thing.  For both terminal value approaches, it is essential to use a range of appropriate discount rates, exit multiples and perpetuity growth rates in order to establish a functional valuation range.

When the valuation is based on [[free cash flow to firm]] then the formula becomes <math>\n{\\left[\\frac{FCFF_{N+1}}{(WACC_{N}-g)}\\right]}\n</math>, \nwhere the discount rate is correspondingly the [[weighted average cost of capital]].\n\nTo determine the present value of the terminal value, one must discount its value at T<sub>0</sub> by a factor equal to the number of years included in the initial projection period. \nIf N is the 5th and final year in this period, then the Terminal Value is divided by (1 + k)<sup>5</sup> (or WACC).\nThe Present Value of the Terminal Value is then added to the PV of the free cash flows in the projection period to arrive at an implied [[enterprise value]].\n\nIf the growth rate in perpetuity is not constant, a multiple-stage terminal value is calculated. The terminal growth rate can be negative, if the company in question is assumed to disappear in the future.\n\n==Exit Multiple Approach==\n{{see also|Valuation using multiples|Relative valuation}}\nThe Exit or Terminal Multiple Approach assumes a business will be sold at the end of the projection period. Valuation analytics are determined for various operating statistics using comparable acquisitions. A frequently used terminal multiple is Enterprise Value/EBITDA or [[EV/EBITDA]]. The analysis of comparable acquisitions will indicate an appropriate range of multiples to use. The multiple is then applied to the projected EBITDA in Year N, which is the final year in the projection period. This provides a [[future value]] at the end of Year N. The terminal value is then discounted using a factor equal to the number of years in the projection period. If N is the 5th and final year in this period, then the Terminal Value is divided by (1+k)<sup>5</sup>. The Present Value of the Terminal Value is then added to the PV of the free cash flows in the projection period to arrive at an implied Enterprise Value. Note that if publicly traded comparable company multiples must be used, the resulting implied enterprise value will not reflect a [[control premium]]. Depending on the purposes of the valuation, this may not provide an appropriate reference range.\n\n==Comparison of methodologies==\nThere are several important differences between the two approaches.\n\nThe Perpetuity Growth Model has several inherent characteristics that make it intellectually challenging.  Because both the discount rate and growth rate are assumptions, inaccuracies in one or both inputs can provide an improper value.  The difference between the two values in the denominator determines the terminal value, and even with appropriate values for both, the denominator may result in a multiplying effect that does not estimate an accurate terminal value.  Also, the perpetuity growth rate assumes that free cash flow will continue to grow at a constant rate into perpetuity.  Consider that a perpetuity growth rate exceeding the annualized growth of the [[S&P 500]] and/or the U.S. [[GDP]] implies that the company's cash flow will outpace and eventually absorb these rather large values. Perhaps the greatest disadvantage to the Perpetuity Growth Model is that it lacks the market-driven analytics employed in the Exit Multiple Approach.  Such analytics result in a terminal value based on operating statistics present in a proven market for similar transactions.  This provides a certain level of confidence that the valuation accurately depicts how the market would value the company in reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the Exit Multiple approach must be used carefully, because multiples change over time.  Simply applying the current market multiple ignores the possibility that current multiples may be high or low by historical standards.  In addition, it is important to note that at a given discount rate, any exit multiple implies a terminal growth rate and conversely any terminal growth rate implies an exit multiple.  When using the Exit Multiple approach it is often helpful to calculate the implied terminal growth rate, because a multiple that may appear reasonable at first glance can actually imply a terminal growth rate that is unrealistic.\n\nIn practice, academics tend to use the Perpetuity Growth Model, while [[investment bank]]ers favor the Exit Multiple approach.  Ultimately, these methods are two different ways of saying the same thing.  For both terminal value approaches, it is essential to use a range of appropriate discount rates, exit multiples and perpetuity growth rates in order to establish a functional valuation range.
