It was founded in 1619 by [[Edward Alleyn]], an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] actor, with the original purpose of educating 12 poor scholars as the foundation of 'God's Gift'.\n\nAdmission by examination is mainly into years 3, 7, 9, and 12 (i.e. ages 7, 11, 13, and 16 years old) to the Junior, Lower, Middle and Upper Schools into which the college is divided. It is a member of both the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and the [[Eton Group]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1619: Foundation: The College of God's Gift at Dulwich===\n[[File:Edward alleyn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Alleyn]], founder of the School]]\nFounder's Day at Dulwich College is celebrated at the end of the Summer Term to commemorate the signing of the [[letters patent]] by [[James I of England|James I]] on 21 June 1619 authorising Edward Alleyn to establish a college in Dulwich to be called [[Alleyn's College|'the College of God's Gift]], in Dulwich in [[Surrey]]'.<ref name=\"GG3 5\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 3\u20135, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The term \"Dulwich College\" was used [[colloquially]] from that date, such as in 1675 when [[John Evelyn]] described his visit to Dulwich College in his ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]]''.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 20, (Heinemann: London)</ref> However, for at least 263 years this colloquialism was incorrect as the school was part of the overall charitable Foundation.<ref name=\"DD32\">Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.32, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref>  Edward Alleyn, as well as being a famous Elizabethan actor, for whom [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote his title roles, performed at the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]],<ref>Piggott, J R, (2008), ''Dulwich College, a history 1616\u20132008'', pages 3\u201310 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> was also a man of great property and wealth, derived mainly from places of entertainment including theatres and bear-gardens.<ref name=\"DD22\">Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.22, (William Darby: Dulwich).

Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 11, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Rumours that Alleyn turned his attention towards charitable pursuits out of fear for his moral well-being have been traced to the journalist [[George Augustus Henry Sala|George Sala]] and questioned though never firmly answered in the negative.<ref name=\"DD22\" /> \n\nSince 1605, Alleyn had owned the [[Manorialism|manorial]] estate of Dulwich, and it may have been around this time that he first had the idea of establishing a college or hospital for poor people and the education of poor boys.<ref name=\"GG3 5\" /> \nThe building on Dulwich Green of a chapel, a schoolhouse and twelve almshouses, began in 1613 and was completed in the autumn of 1616. On 1 September 1616 the chapel was consecrated by the [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|Archbishop of Canterbury]] who became the official [[Visitor]]. However, Edward Alleyn faced objections from [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], in getting the patent of incorporation that was necessary to secure the Foundation's status as a college.  It was Alleyn's persistence that led to the foundation being endowed by James I's signing of the letters patent.<ref name=\"GG3 5\" />\n\nThe charity originally consisted of a Master, Warden, four fellows, six poor brothers, six poor sisters and twelve poor scholars (orphans admitted from the age of six years), who became the joint legal owners of Alleyn's endowment of the manor and lands of Dulwich, collectively known as the Members of the College.<ref name=\"GG3 5\" /> The poor brothers and sisters and scholars were to be drawn from the four parishes that were most closely tied to Alleyn (being St Botolph's Bishopsgate where he was born, St Giles, Middlesex where he had built his Fortune Theatre, St Saviour's Southwark where he had the Paris Bear Garden and had managed the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], and St Giles Camberwell where the college was founded).<ref>Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.24, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> The business of the charity was conducted in the name of these thirty members by the Master, Warden and four Fellows (Chaplain, Schoolmaster, Usher and Organist).<ref name=\"DD32\" />\n\nAlleyn drew upon the experience of other similar establishments in order to formulate the statutes and ordinances of the college, including drawing on the statutes of the already ancient [[Winchester College]] and visiting the more contemporary establishments of Sutton's Hospital (now [[Charterhouse School]]) and Croydon's Hospital (now the [[almshouses]] of the [[Whitgift Foundation]]).<ref>Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.23, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> Among the many statutes and ordinances signed by Alleyn that pertained to the charitable scheme were provisions that the scholars ''were entitled to stay until they were eighteen.'' And ''to be taught in good and sound learning\u2019\u2026\u2019that they might be prepared for university or for good and sweet trades and occupations.''<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 9, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Another stipulation was that the Master and Warden should always be unmarried and of Alleyn's blood, and surname, and if the former was impossible then at least of Alleyn's surname.<ref name=\"GG8\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 8, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Alleyn also made provision that the people of Dulwich should be able to have their ''men children'' instructed at the school for a fee as well as children from outside Dulwich for a separate fee.<ref name=\"GG8\" />\n\nThe next two centuries were beset by both external difficulties such as diminishing financial fortunes and failing buildings as well as internal strife between the various Members of the College. The Official Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose function was to ensure that the statutes were obeyed, was called in many times.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 11\u201313, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The lack of a disinterested body of governors and of any official connection to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge contributed significantly to the school failing to fulfill Alleyn's vision in its first two centuries.<ref name=\"GG26\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 26, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Some notable Masters did preside over the college during this time, including [[James Alleyn|James Allen]] (the first Master to drop the 'y' from his surname), who in 1741 made over to the college six houses in Kensington, the rents of which were to be used in the establishment of two small schools in Dulwich, one for boys from the village, the other for girls to read and sew, out of which [[James Allen's Girls' School]] (JAGS) arose. Dr [[John Allen (historian)|John Allen]] (1771\u20131843) of [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] was a most learned and influential man, but neglected the education of the Poor Scholars.<ref>Piggott, J R, ''Dulwich College, a History, 1616\u20132008'', pages 84\u201388, (Dulwich College: London).</ref>\n\n===1808: Dulwich College Building Act===\nHaving already obtained an Act in 1805 allowing them to enclose and develop {{convert|130|acre|km2}} of common land within the manor, the college was granted the power by the 1808 Dulwich College Building Act to extend the period over which leases ran, from twenty-one years as laid down by Alleyn, to eighty-four years, thus attracting richer tenants and bringing in large sums of money.<ref name=\"GG26\" /> The increased wealth of the college eventually resulted in the [[Charity Commission]] establishment of an enquiry into the advisability of widening the application of the funds to those extra beneficiaries Alleyn had specified in later amended clauses to the foundation's original statutes. Although the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale|Lord Langdale]] rejected the appeal in 1841 on the grounds that Alleyn had no right to alter the original statutes, he did express dissatisfaction with the college's educational provision.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 29, (Heinemann: London)</ref> \n\nImmediately after this criticism, the Dulwich College Grammar School was established in 1842 for the education of poor boys from Dulwich and [[Camberwell]]. To this school were transferred the boys of the James Allen Foundation, leaving James Allen's school for girls only. The Old Grammar School, as it became known, was erected in 1841 opposite the Old College, designed by Sir [[Charles Barry]], the architect of the [[Palace of Westminster]]. It still exists today.<ref>Darby, W., (1967), ''Dulwich: A Place in History'', p.34, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> The foundation scholars of the college continued to receive an education far short of Alleyn's vision, despite further attempts at reform by the Visitor. In 1854, the college was investigated by a new Commission set up by the 1853 Charitable Trusts Act which led to the 1857 Dulwich College Act.<ref name=\"GG32 34\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 32-34, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n===1857: Alleyn's College of God's Gift===\nThe 'College of God's Gift' became [[Alleyn's College|Alleyn's College of God's Gift]] when, on 25 August 1857, the Dulwich College Act dissolved the existing corporation and the charity was reconstituted with the new name. It was split into two parts with a joint Board of Governors: the ''educational'' (for the college) and the ''eleemosynary'' (for the charity). The Master, Warden, four fellows and 12 servants were pensioned off, although Alleyn's wishes were, and continue to be, respected, as sixteen pensioners (being the equivalent of 12 poor brothers and sisters plus four fellows) still live in flats in the Old College, looked after by a Warden. As for the Master, he was still to be appointed as the head of the new school. In its new form, the Master of the College was Reverend Alfred Carver (Master from April 1857 to April 1883). \n\nCarver successfully fought with the Chairman of the Governors, the Rev William Rogers, to create a public school with high academic standards.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 117\u2013125, 140\u2013148, 165 (Dulwich College: London.</ref> He was the first Master not to share the name of the school's founder \"Alleyn\" (or latterly \"Allen\").<ref name=\"GG32 34\" /> The educational college was split into an ''\"Upper\"'' and ''\"Lower\"'' school. The \"Upper school\" was for boys between 8 and 18, to be taught a wide and detailed syllabus, and continued to be colloquially referred to as ''\"Dulwich College\"''.<ref name=\"DD32\" /> The \"Lower school\" for boys between 8 and 16, had lower fees and a syllabus and was aimed at children of the industrial and poorer classes. The Lower School was the incorporation of the boys from the grammar school established in the previous decade<ref name=\"GG32 34\" /> and was referred to as ''\"Alleyn's College of God's Gift\"'', although this was the name of the complete charitable foundation.<ref name=\"DD32\" />\n\n===1870: The New College===\nDulwich College was included in Howard Staunton's 1865 book, ''The Great Schools of England'', who wrote of the ''unusually comprehensive [scheme of instruction]'' and by the mid-1860s such was the enhanced reputation of the school that the pressure for places led to the introduction of a competitive examination.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 41, (Heinemann: London)</ref> In 1869 the upper school took possession of the current site, referred to as the ''\"New College\"'', but it was not until Founder's Day (21 June) 1870 that the new college was officially opened by the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]].<ref name=\"GG45\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 45, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The new college buildings, sited in the 24 hectares (60 acres) of Dulwich Common, were designed by [[Charles Barry, Jr.]] (the eldest son of Sir [[Charles Barry]]).<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 44, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The lower school alone continued to occupy the Old College in Dulwich Village from 1870 until it was moved to its new (and current) premises in East Dulwich in 1887.<ref name=\"DD32\" />\n\nThe present school colours and school magazine (''The Alleynian'') were established in the 1860s and 1870s, as were school societies such as ''Debating'' and ''Natural Science''.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 51, (Heinemann: London)</ref> By the time Canon Carver retired from the position of Master in 1882, Dulwich College was said to have expanded more rapidly in the previous 25 years than any other establishment<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 57, (Heinemann: London)</ref> and to be ''holding its own at universities'', to have ''won a large number of places of honour in the Indian and Home Civil Service'' and ''at [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|the Royal Military College of Woolwich]]'' and to be well represented among ''the public schools medals of the [[Royal Geographic Society]] and the prizes of the Art Schools of the [[Royal Academy]]''.<ref>''The Times'', 11 January 1883</ref>\n\n=== 1882: Separation from Alleyn's School; the college's 'Golden Age' ===\nDespite its excellent reputation, the college was the focus of pressure by the Charity Commissioners and other parties (including the Board of Governors and the outlying parishes named in Edward Alleyn's will) to reorganise it and divert much of its endowment to other schemes. The Master, Canon Carver, resisted these pressures for many years, finally winning an appeal in 1876 at the highest possible level (the [[Privy Council]]) where [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]] ruled in his favour. In 1882, the [[Charity Commission]]ers finally issued a scheme that Canon Carver found acceptable. This passed into law by Act of Parliament and resulted in the Upper and Lower schools being officially split into separate institutions. The Upper School became Dulwich College (''officially'' for the first time) and the Lower became [[Alleyn's School]].<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 55, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Both schools remained within the [[Alleyn's College|Alleyn's College of God's Gift]] charitable foundation (along with [[James Allen's Girls' School]], St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School, and the three Central Foundation schools in [[Finsbury]] and [[Bishopsgate]]). \n\nTwo Boards of Governors came into being. Both Dulwich College and Alleyn's School were to be managed by the college Governors who also administered the Chapel and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery|Picture Gallery]]. The Estates and Almshouses were placed in the hands of the Estates Governors. The foundation and the college are still governed under the same arrangement. The Archbishop of Canterbury's position as Visitor was also changed to that of Honorary Visitor of Alleyn's College of God's Gift, his powers being vested in the Charity Commissioners.<ref>Ormiston, T. L., (1926), ''Dulwich College Register'',page 4, (J J Keliher & Co Ltd: London)</ref> Dulwich College's income is derived from the contributions by the Estates Governors, among whom the College Governors are well represented (having eight of the twenty five places)<ref>Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.33, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> Canon Carver retired at this point, being the first headmaster to be both appointed and retired by Act of Parliament.<ref>Darby, W., (1967), ''Dulwich: A Place in History'', p.33, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref>\n\nCanon Carver was said to have given the college a body, but [[Arthur Herman Gilkes]] (Master from 1885\u20131914) to have given it a soul, with his noble ideals of scholarship and public service. He founded the College Mission in a poverty-stricken part of Camberwell.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History, 1616\u20132008'', pages 177\u2013188 (Dulwich College: London).</ref>\n\n[[London County Council]] scholars were admitted to Dulwich College from 1903. The college was saved from [[bankruptcy]] by the 'Dulwich College Experiment' or 'Gilkes Experiment', the work of A H Gilkes's son Christopher Gilkes (Master from 1941\u20131953), the forerunner of the state 'Assisted Places Scheme', by which the majority of boys selected to attend the college had their fees paid by local councils. This resulted in an academic 'Renaissance' of the college which came to a climax from the late 1950s when the college was at the forefront of the schools winning awards on entry to Oxford and Cambridge.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 273\u2013277 (Dulwich College: London).</ref>\n\n==School arms==\n[[File:Alleyn'sCrest.jpg|upright|left|Original Alleyn Crest]]When Edward Alleyn founded the school he was awarded a [[coat of arms]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. This was used by the school until, in 1935, it was decreed by the [[College of Arms]] that it was the exclusive property of Edward Alleyn and his family.<ref name=\"GG117\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 117, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The new arms granted by the College of Arms were very similar to the old ones retaining most of the features. Deism and learning are represented by the flames in the crest. From the ring of flames an arm with a hand holding a heart protrudes. This probably symbolises charity<ref name=\"GG117\" /> and has a twofold meaning. First, it represents Alleyn's charitable intentions, and second it recalls Alleyn's famous speech, written by [[Ben Jonson]], when he presented King James I with the flaming heart of London during ''The Magnificent Entertainment'', involving a procession through the streets and through triumphal arches by which the [[City of London]] welcomed King James I from [[Scotland]] in 1604. The lower portion of the shield incorporates the original shield being an argent (silver) background on which are placed a chevron (bent bar) dividing three [[cinquefoil]]s gules (red five pointed stars).<ref>Stanley W Wells, (2002), ''Shakespeare Survey'', page 172, (Cambridge University Press)</ref>\n\n==Houses==\n[[File:New Buildings at Dulwich College.

The Master moved out of this premises during the Second World War into Ivyholme. When Ivyholme reopened as a boarding house it was decided that the Master should not return to Bell House because it was too large for the purposes of a family residence. The Master moved to The Chestnuts and then in 1949 to Elm Lawn.<ref name=\"GG 138\" /> Meanwhile, Bell House was adapted as a boarding house and became the second junior house, replacing Elm Lawn. In 1993 it was returned to private ownership, as the college recognised the lack of need for a second junior boarding house.\n\n; Carver House : As the number of boys requiring boarding increased towards the end of the Second World War a fifth house was created by converting the cricket pavilion. It was named after Canon Carver, first Master of the reconstituted College, but it did not last long in this form.<ref name=\"GG 137\" />\n\n====Boarding house clubs and colours====\n[[File:DulwichCollegeBoardingHouseColours.png|thumb|upright|right|The ties denoting from left to right, Blew house colours, Caerulean Club membership, Ivyholme colours, and Zodiac Club membership]]The colour system (for more detail see ''[[#School uniform and colours|School uniform and colours]]'' below) also extended to the Boarding Houses due to their particular impact on college life.<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 pages 222\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 222, (Heinemann: London)</ref> At one time, Bell, Ivyholme and Blew, had their own sports teams and their own distinct colours. Those awarded colours could wear ties and caps and for outstanding contribution the house blazer was awarded. Boarders with no colours could wear black ties to distinguish them from day boys. \n\nToday, senior boys can still become members of the Zodiac and Caerulean Clubs for Ivyholme and Blew respectively. The house captain, who is automatically a member of the club,  controls membership of clubs, and such membership confers the right to wear a special tie. When, across the school, the uniform was standardised in 1970, the tradition of the house blazers disappeared save for the House Captain who, if he has earned full school colours, may wear the house blazer.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 page 303\">J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', page 303 (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n\n====Gordon Bowl====\nThis trophy was presented to the college prior to the Second World War. It was a trophy competed for by boarders only presented by an Old Alleynian, A.G.Gordon. It was originally competed for by the four boarding houses (when there was no junior/senior distinction), but after the Second World War only by the senior houses Blew House and Ivyholme until 2017, the year which Orchard were readded to the competition. It is still played for today.<ref name=\"GG223 224\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, pages 223\u2013224, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n===Day Houses===\nAll boys are members of one of eight [[House system|day houses]] or ''Athletic Houses'' as they were originally known.<ref name=\"GG223 224\" /> The Houses were the brainchild of W.D. ('Scottie') Gibbon, an assistant master and rugby coach.<ref name=\"GG223 224\" /> The idea was decided upon in 1919 and in the school magazine, ''The Alleynian'', of March 1920 the process was described. The division would be into six houses to be named after ''distinguished Englishmen of the Elizabethan period''<ref name=\"AllLent2006 2\">''The Alleynian'', Lent 2006, page 2</ref> (see table below). The name of Shakespeare was omitted as being considered pre-eminent.<ref name=\"GPS 94\">Webster F.A.M., (1937), ''Our Great Public Schools'', page 92, (Butler & Tanner: London)</ref>  Upon their original creation Boarders and Day Boys were divided thus: ''Grenville'' included ''Blew House'', ''Marlowe'' included ''The Orchard'', Spenser included ''Elm Lawn'', ''Sidney'' included ''Ivyholme'' and two entirely Day-boy houses were created: ''Drake'' and ''Raleigh''. In 1982 two more Houses (Jonson and Howard) were added due to an increased College roll. \n \nThe athletic houses were created to improve the standard of games at the college, which had deteriorated during the First World War. Before the creation of these houses, the most keenly anticipated matches were the '''Boarders vs Day-Boys''' or the '''Prefects vs The Rest of the School'''. The Athletic Houses produced, and still produce, '''Big Sides''' and '''Little Sides''' for competition.<ref name=\"GG223 224\" /> Big Sides are Houses teams that include players who also represent the school and Little are House sides that do not include school sporting representatives.\nA boy's house is decided randomly or through family connection where possible. The houses continue to compete in sporting and cultural competitions (such as music, drama, chess and debating).<ref name=\"AllLent2006 2\" /> The '''Cock House''' ''Shield'' or ''Cup'' are presented to the leading House at the end of the school year taking into account all competitions.<ref name=\"GPS 94\" />\n\n== School uniform and colours ==\nThe dress code for pupils of Dulwich College depends on the boarding or day houses a boy might belong to, the sports teams represented, or whether a boy has attained school colours or become a prefect. Alleyn had prescribed the clothing of poor scholars to be ''\"a white calico surplice, a long coat such as that worn by [[Christ's Hospital]] boys, of good cloth of sad (dark and sober) colour, a bodice lined with canvas, skirts with cotton lining, canvas shirts, white cotton drawers, knitted stockings, shoes and belt, a girdle and a black cap.\"''<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 47 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> This is how boys were dressed for over two centuries, until the new foundation in 1857. \n\nIn 1863, the Master, [[Alfred Carver]], decreed the uniform should be \"Short tunic buttoned to the chin, trousers of an Oxford mixture, an ordinary rifle cap with a broad band and narrow peak, and a dark coloured [[Inverness cape]] for winter.\"<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 122 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> Under Carver, boys still wore waistcoats of varied hues and \"the latest creations in neckties\". This was suppressed in 1883 by the new Master, [[James Welldon|Welldon]], whose first rule on arrival was that the boys should wear uniform, a forerunner of the [[subfusc]] jackets of today.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 166 (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n[[File:DulwichCollegeWhiteBlazer.png|thumb|left|upright|Example of the white blazer only awarded to the most prominent sportsmen]]\nThe colours of the college, blue and black, according to tradition are based on [[Marlborough College]] although [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]] is more likely the model. It is known that in 1864 caps were introduced, with cross ribbons of purple soon altered to blue. The college arms were added in 1875.<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 page 50\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 50, (Heinemann: London)</ref> From this time, the colour scheme arose for rewarding achievement, limited at first to sport with blazers for the 1st and 2nd team of the major sports, rugby and cricket (as well as ties, caps and squares). The minor sports also had colours, although these did not extend to a full blazer. Rather, athletics, fives, shooting, boxing, tennis, swimming, gymnastics, fencing and waterpolo had blazer badges (plus caps and ties). Additionally, the boarding houses, which historically had a disproportionate effect on the sporting life of the college, had their own boarding house colours. ''(For more details see [[Dulwich College#Boarding Houses|Boarding Houses]])''<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 pages 222\"/>\nBy 1909 there were seventeen different caps plus a variety of blazers. The striped jackets for prominent sportsmen also conferred certain privileges, such as having the right to proceed first through the doors of centre block. \n\nFurther emphasising status were special caps for major sports colours. Rugby had a pie-shaped porker with tassels. Likewise, prefects wearing caps quartered in blue and black, could unbutton their jackets and keep their hands in their trousers.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 303\"/> The most exclusive items took precedence even over the striped blazers of members of the 1st teams for major sports. The very best rugby players were on rare occasions awarded the rugby honours cap, and perhaps the most fabled item of all, still displayed in the college's Wodehouse library, was the white blazer. This was only awarded on the recommendation of the Field Sports Committee (see [[Dulwich College#Sport|Sport section]]) with the essential requirement being that a boy be a member of both the Cricket 1st XI and the Rugby 1st XV ''and'' display prominence in a minor sport (e.g. boxing, fives, squash, fencing, shooting).<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 227\"/>\n \nThis uniform changed little till the 1960s (save for the arms change in 1935, and the addition of the house colours on sports shirts following the athletics houses foundation in 1920). By the 60s, boys (other than prefects and those with sporting honours) had to wear a black jacket and either grey flannels or pinstripe trousers in the Autumn and Winter terms. Shortly after the start of the Summer term, an announcement would be made that henceforth, for the rest of the term, blazers (navy blue with a white embroidered DC in gothic script) and grey flannels would be worn, along with the option of boaters. The traditional cap which was balanced on the back of the head was to be worn when in uniform off school premises and (no doubt because of its precarious perch) boys would \"cap\" those to whom they would otherwise have raised their caps. \"Capping\" involved touching the College arms on the cap with the left hand.<ref>Personal recollections, 1955\u201362)</ref> The 1960s saw the demise of caps and boaters and a reduction in the variety of blazers,<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 page 50\"/> as well as the end of shirts with separate collars.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 page 303\"/>\n\n== Co-curricular ==\n\n=== Sport ===\nWhen Arthur Herman Gilkes became Master, he adhered to Carver's belief that the physical organisation of the school should be based on the principle that as far as possible management should be in the hands of the boys. Therefore, he continued the tradition of the general running of games being entrusted to a Field Sports Board (sometimes referred to as the Field Sports Committee), composed of the \"school captain,  captains of cricket, football (rugby), gymnastics, the baths (swimming), fencing, [[fives]], athletics sports, boxing and shooting\".<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 221\u2013222, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Gilkes had it that the only masters with authorised status with regards to games were the captain of the Rifle Corps, and treasurer of the Sports Board. By 1894 there no more masters on the Field Sports Committee.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 180 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> The Board at the time controlled the appointment of captains and had some say in the style of blazers that could be worn as uniform.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 374 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> It was the Field Sports Committee, for example, that governed the award of the college's most prestigious colours, the white blazer. The system today is very different with assistant masters now being in charge of games, and acting more as coaches.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 334 (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n\nColours for sporting achievement were the first such colours to be established at the college (see [[#School uniform and colours|School uniform and colours]] below). Originally colours consisted of blazers for the 1st and 2nd team of the major sports, rugby and cricket (as well as ties, caps and squares) and colours for minor sports, (not extending to a full blazer but blazer badges plus caps and ties).<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 pages 222\"/> Caps were also available, such as for rugby, the pie shaped porker<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 303\">J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 303 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> and more exclusive items such as the rare rugby honours cap, and the white blazer, only awarded on the recommendation of the Field Sports Committee with the essential requirement being that a boy be a member of both the Cricket 1st XI and the Rugby 1st XV ''and'' display prominence in a minor sport.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 227\">J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 227 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> Testament to the judgment of the committee are the careers of certain alumni who received this blazer such as [[Trevor Bailey]] the [[England cricket]] all-rounder, who was so awarded because he was also a distinguished squash player.\n\nThe college still divides sport into Major and Minor. The major sports have always included rugby and cricket in the Michaelmas and summer terms respectively and for many decades just these two were deemed as major. In the twentieth century, [[field hockey]] became a major sport in the Lent term, having been introduced in 1953. [[Soccer]], a minor sport since it was allowed in 1970, became of equal status to hockey in 2000. A raft of minor sports have also been recognised at the college for well over a century in many cases. Minor sports have included athletics from 1864; Fives from 1894 (effectively ended by the courts being destroyed by enemy bombs in the Second World War); shooting from 1878 (less applicable due to safety regulations and the loss of the .22 range); boxing from 1879 (abandoned in the 1960s but with martial arts now filling the void), tennis from 1880 (although banned during A H Gilkes' time); swimming from 1883 with the college being one of the first schools to erect a swimming pool; gymnastics from 1891; fencing (like boxing, saw a demise in the 1960s but still has a representative team); squash and water polo. The school also has teams for golf; rowing (a recent introduction in 1991 \u2013 the school now owns a boathouse on the [[River Thames]]); badminton; basketball; croquet; cycling; skiing; table tennis and rugby fives. The facilities, which include a sports centre complex, courts for most racquet sports, an athletic track, tennis courts, a swimming pool and acres of playing fields, cater to almost all sporting requirements.<ref>Terry Walsh ''Games and Sports'', in J R Piggott's, ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 334\u2013355,  (2008) (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n\n===Rugby===\n[[File:DulwichCollegeRugbyHonoursCap.png|thumb|right|Example of the rugby honours cap, which, until around 1969, was awarded to only the very best players]]The major sport of the Michaelmas term, Dulwich College rugby has long enjoyed a powerful reputation. The school began its rugby tradition with a 1\u20130 victory over [[City of London School]] in 1859, 12 years before the founding of the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Since that time the school has had upwards of 30 Old Alleynians play at full international level, with more playing at schoolboy international level, national reserve and professional club rugby as well as representatives for invitational sides such as [[Barbarian FC|the Barbarians]]. \n\nThree [[British and Irish Lions]] have emerged from the college. 1909 featured an unbeaten first XV which contained five future internationals dubbed the 'Famous Five'. Between 2012 and 2014, Dulwich College won the Natwest Schools Cup (previously known as the Daily Mail Cup) three times in a row. Then in 2017 secured an historic double, becoming the first ever team to win both the schools cup (in the years mentioned) and the Champions Trophy, the highest Tier of School Cup Rugby.<ref>Jan Piggot, ''Dulwich College: A History, 1616\u20132008'', 2008, {{ISBN|0-9539493-2-X}}</ref>\n\n=== CCF ===\nDulwich College has a well-established [[Combined Cadet Force]] contingent that has been running since when the organisation was founded in 1859.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://combinedcadetforce.org.uk/|title=Homepage {{!}} Combined Cadet Force|last=Putty|first=Electric|date=2017-06-02|website=Combined Cadet Force|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref> The cadets can choose between three sections: Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force, with most cadets joining in year 9. Since 2018 the DCCF has accepted female cadets from [[James Allen's Girls' School|JAGS]] (James Allen Girls School) .The DCCCF regularly conducts battlecraft trips, flying days at RAF Benson and expeditions to the arctic or desert. The DCCCF are Gold medal winners in the Cambrian Patrol and have won both the Guthrie cup, London district shooting competition, 1st place regional first aid, 2nd place in National First Aid (making the first aid team the best in England and Wales) and the [[Ground Training Competition|Air Squadron Trophy Competition]]. They came first both regionally and nationally in 2020. As of 2020 the RAF section is the most decorated section in Britain and the DCCF is also the most decorated contingent nationally.\n\n=== Scouts ===\nDulwich College has a scout troop which has two patrols within it. It runs from year 6 to year 13 with both scouts and explorers. The troop is called the 25th Camberwell and has been running for over 80 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.25thcamberwell.org.uk/|title=25th CAMBERWELL SCOUTS & DULWICH EXPLORERS|website=25th CAMBERWELL SCOUTS & DULWICH EXPLORERS|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Dulwich College Union ===\nDulwich College has a large union for clubs and societies containing over 50 societies. There is a wide range of clubs ranging from Rocketry to History and the college used to have a Chicken society in which boys tended to the college's chickens. The clubs, and Union, are run by boys in Year 12 and 13 and contribute to their Duke of Edinburg awards. Most of these clubs and societies have their own personalised ties.\n\n==== Debating ====\nWithin the Dulwich College Union debating plays a large role. The Dulwich College society runs during the school terms but competes both nationally and internationally. The society runs from year 7 to 13 and has around 50 members. It has recently enjoyed great success, winning the Oxford Union Debating Competition in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Cambridge Union Schools Debating Competition in 2014 and 2015, and the ESU (English Speaking Union) Schools Mace Debating Competition, also in 2014 and 2015. It has also represented Team England and competed internationally against other national teams. It has also competed in Texas, Singapore and Stuttgart. Dulwich College is, therefore, ranked as one of the top debating schools in the UK (second only to St Paul's) and one of the best in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dulwich.org.uk/college/college-life/co-curricular/debating|title=Debating \u2013 Co-curricular \u2013 College Life \u2013 Dulwich College|website=www.dulwich.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820160544/http://www.dulwich.org.uk/college/college-life/co-curricular/debating|archive-date=20 August 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==School magazine==\nThe Dulwich College school magazine is called the ''Alleynian'', named after the school's founder Edward Alleyn. This magazine was first published in 1873, although the school's first magazine under the name the ''Dulwich College Magazine for School News and General Reading'' had been published in 1864 but only lasted for fourteen issues after its editor left for Cambridge University.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> ''The Alleynian'' was edited at one point by [[P.G.Wodehouse]] in his last year at the school.<ref name=\"GG82\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 82, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n==Old Alleynians==\n{{main|List of Old Alleynians}}\n{{see also|Category:People educated at Dulwich College}}\n\nOld boys of Dulwich College are called \"Old Alleynians\", after the founder of the school. This is often abbreviated to ''\"O.A.\"'' as post-nominal letters in brackets in school publications or publications specifically concerning the school. The term should not be confused with \"Alleyn's Old Boys\" used for alumni of [[Alleyn's School]]. Current pupils of the school are known as Alleynians. Prior to around 1880, the terms \"Alleynian\" and \"Old Alleynian\" were not used and the pupils and ex-pupils were known as ''Dulwichians.''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 49, (Heinemann: London)</ref> \n\nNotable Old Alleynians include [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]], [[P G Wodehouse|Sir P G Wodehouse]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Sir Edward George]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Michael Ondaatje]], David Thomson, [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Nigel Farage]], the cricketer [[Trevor Bailey]], [[C. S. Forester]] and the architect [[C. F. A. Voysey]].\n\n==Headmastership of Dulwich College==\nThe Head Master of Dulwich College is styled ''The Master of Dulwich College'', as laid out in the 1882 scheme of the Charity Commissioners. This continued a tradition of the Head of the college being called the ''Master'' since its foundation in 1619. The Foundation originally had a governing body consisting of a Master, Warden, four Fellows, and six Assistants made up of the two churchwardens of each of the three parishes of St Botolph's, Bishopsgate, of St Saviour's, Southwark, and of St Giles', Cripplegate. The Master was most senior, followed by the Warden and on vacancy of the Mastership, the Warden succeeded. By the 1857 Dulwich College Act the Master, Warden and Fellows were pensioned and the governance of the foundation switched to a body of nineteen Governors. However, the position of ''Master'' continued as the title of the Headmaster of the new Upper School, with an Undermaster as deputy. The 1882 Act (as a result of the Charity Commissioners scheme) abolished the office of Undermaster.<ref>Ormiston, T.

It was founded in 1619 by [[Edward Alleyn]], an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] actor, with the original purpose of educating 12 poor scholars as the foundation of 'God's Gift'.\n\nAdmission by examination is mainly into years 3, 7, 9, and 12 (i.e. ages 7, 11, 13, and 16 years old) to the Junior, Lower, Middle and Upper Schools into which the college is divided. It is a member of both the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and the [[Eton Group]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1619: Foundation: The College of God's Gift at Dulwich===\n[[File:Edward alleyn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Alleyn]], founder of the School]]\nFounder's Day at Dulwich College is celebrated at the end of the Summer Term to commemorate the signing of the [[letters patent]] by [[James I of England|James I]] on 21 June 1619 authorising Edward Alleyn to establish a college in Dulwich to be called [[Alleyn's College|'the College of God's Gift]], in Dulwich in [[Surrey]]'.<ref name=\"GG3 5\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 3\u20135, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The term \"Dulwich College\" was used [[colloquially]] from that date, such as in 1675 when [[John Evelyn]] described his visit to Dulwich College in his ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]]''.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 20, (Heinemann: London)</ref> However, for at least 263 years this colloquialism was incorrect as the school was part of the overall charitable Foundation.<ref name=\"DD32\">Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.32, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref>  Edward Alleyn, as well as being a famous Elizabethan actor, for whom [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote his title roles, performed at the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]],<ref>Piggott, J R, (2008), ''Dulwich College, a history 1616\u20132008'', pages 3\u201310 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> was also a man of great property and wealth, derived mainly from places of entertainment including theatres and bear-gardens.<ref name=\"DD22\">Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.22, (William Darby: Dulwich).

Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 11, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Rumours that Alleyn turned his attention towards charitable pursuits out of fear for his moral well-being have been traced to the journalist [[George Augustus Henry Sala|George Sala]] and questioned though never firmly answered in the negative.<ref name=\"DD22\" /> \n\nSince 1605, Alleyn had owned the [[Manorialism|manorial]] estate of Dulwich, and it may have been around this time that he first had the idea of establishing a college or hospital for poor people and the education of poor boys.<ref name=\"GG3 5\" /> \nThe building on Dulwich Green of a chapel, a schoolhouse and twelve almshouses, began in 1613 and was completed in the autumn of 1616. On 1 September 1616 the chapel was consecrated by the [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|Archbishop of Canterbury]] who became the official [[Visitor]]. However, Edward Alleyn faced objections from [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], in getting the patent of incorporation that was necessary to secure the Foundation's status as a college.  It was Alleyn's persistence that led to the foundation being endowed by James I's signing of the letters patent.<ref name=\"GG3 5\" />\n\nThe charity originally consisted of a Master, Warden, four fellows, six poor brothers, six poor sisters and twelve poor scholars (orphans admitted from the age of six years), who became the joint legal owners of Alleyn's endowment of the manor and lands of Dulwich, collectively known as the Members of the College.<ref name=\"GG3 5\" /> The poor brothers and sisters and scholars were to be drawn from the four parishes that were most closely tied to Alleyn (being St Botolph's Bishopsgate where he was born, St Giles, Middlesex where he had built his Fortune Theatre, St Saviour's Southwark where he had the Paris Bear Garden and had managed the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], and St Giles Camberwell where the college was founded).<ref>Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.24, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> The business of the charity was conducted in the name of these thirty members by the Master, Warden and four Fellows (Chaplain, Schoolmaster, Usher and Organist).<ref name=\"DD32\" />\n\nAlleyn drew upon the experience of other similar establishments in order to formulate the statutes and ordinances of the college, including drawing on the statutes of the already ancient [[Winchester College]] and visiting the more contemporary establishments of Sutton's Hospital (now [[Charterhouse School]]) and Croydon's Hospital (now the [[almshouses]] of the [[Whitgift Foundation]]).<ref>Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.23, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> Among the many statutes and ordinances signed by Alleyn that pertained to the charitable scheme were provisions that the scholars ''were entitled to stay until they were eighteen.'' And ''to be taught in good and sound learning\u2019\u2026\u2019that they might be prepared for university or for good and sweet trades and occupations.''<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 9, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Another stipulation was that the Master and Warden should always be unmarried and of Alleyn's blood, and surname, and if the former was impossible then at least of Alleyn's surname.<ref name=\"GG8\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 8, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Alleyn also made provision that the people of Dulwich should be able to have their ''men children'' instructed at the school for a fee as well as children from outside Dulwich for a separate fee.<ref name=\"GG8\" />\n\nThe next two centuries were beset by both external difficulties such as diminishing financial fortunes and failing buildings as well as internal strife between the various Members of the College. The Official Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose function was to ensure that the statutes were obeyed, was called in many times.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 11\u201313, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The lack of a disinterested body of governors and of any official connection to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge contributed significantly to the school failing to fulfill Alleyn's vision in its first two centuries.<ref name=\"GG26\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 26, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Some notable Masters did preside over the college during this time, including [[James Alleyn|James Allen]] (the first Master to drop the 'y' from his surname), who in 1741 made over to the college six houses in Kensington, the rents of which were to be used in the establishment of two small schools in Dulwich, one for boys from the village, the other for girls to read and sew, out of which [[James Allen's Girls' School]] (JAGS) arose. Dr [[John Allen (historian)|John Allen]] (1771\u20131843) of [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] was a most learned and influential man, but neglected the education of the Poor Scholars.<ref>Piggott, J R, ''Dulwich College, a History, 1616\u20132008'', pages 84\u201388, (Dulwich College: London).</ref>\n\n===1808: Dulwich College Building Act===\nHaving already obtained an Act in 1805 allowing them to enclose and develop {{convert|130|acre|km2}} of common land within the manor, the college was granted the power by the 1808 Dulwich College Building Act to extend the period over which leases ran, from twenty-one years as laid down by Alleyn, to eighty-four years, thus attracting richer tenants and bringing in large sums of money.<ref name=\"GG26\" /> The increased wealth of the college eventually resulted in the [[Charity Commission]] establishment of an enquiry into the advisability of widening the application of the funds to those extra beneficiaries Alleyn had specified in later amended clauses to the foundation's original statutes. Although the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale|Lord Langdale]] rejected the appeal in 1841 on the grounds that Alleyn had no right to alter the original statutes, he did express dissatisfaction with the college's educational provision.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 29, (Heinemann: London)</ref> \n\nImmediately after this criticism, the Dulwich College Grammar School was established in 1842 for the education of poor boys from Dulwich and [[Camberwell]]. To this school were transferred the boys of the James Allen Foundation, leaving James Allen's school for girls only. The Old Grammar School, as it became known, was erected in 1841 opposite the Old College, designed by Sir [[Charles Barry]], the architect of the [[Palace of Westminster]]. It still exists today.<ref>Darby, W., (1967), ''Dulwich: A Place in History'', p.34, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> The foundation scholars of the college continued to receive an education far short of Alleyn's vision, despite further attempts at reform by the Visitor. In 1854, the college was investigated by a new Commission set up by the 1853 Charitable Trusts Act which led to the 1857 Dulwich College Act.<ref name=\"GG32 34\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 32-34, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n===1857: Alleyn's College of God's Gift===\nThe 'College of God's Gift' became [[Alleyn's College|Alleyn's College of God's Gift]] when, on 25 August 1857, the Dulwich College Act dissolved the existing corporation and the charity was reconstituted with the new name. It was split into two parts with a joint Board of Governors: the ''educational'' (for the college) and the ''eleemosynary'' (for the charity). The Master, Warden, four fellows and 12 servants were pensioned off, although Alleyn's wishes were, and continue to be, respected, as sixteen pensioners (being the equivalent of 12 poor brothers and sisters plus four fellows) still live in flats in the Old College, looked after by a Warden. As for the Master, he was still to be appointed as the head of the new school. In its new form, the Master of the College was Reverend Alfred Carver (Master from April 1857 to April 1883). \n\nCarver successfully fought with the Chairman of the Governors, the Rev William Rogers, to create a public school with high academic standards.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 117\u2013125, 140\u2013148, 165 (Dulwich College: London.</ref> He was the first Master not to share the name of the school's founder \"Alleyn\" (or latterly \"Allen\").<ref name=\"GG32 34\" /> The educational college was split into an ''\"Upper\"'' and ''\"Lower\"'' school. The \"Upper school\" was for boys between 8 and 18, to be taught a wide and detailed syllabus, and continued to be colloquially referred to as ''\"Dulwich College\"''.<ref name=\"DD32\" /> The \"Lower school\" for boys between 8 and 16, had lower fees and a syllabus and was aimed at children of the industrial and poorer classes. The Lower School was the incorporation of the boys from the grammar school established in the previous decade<ref name=\"GG32 34\" /> and was referred to as ''\"Alleyn's College of God's Gift\"'', although this was the name of the complete charitable foundation.<ref name=\"DD32\" />\n\n===1870: The New College===\nDulwich College was included in Howard Staunton's 1865 book, ''The Great Schools of England'', who wrote of the ''unusually comprehensive [scheme of instruction]'' and by the mid-1860s such was the enhanced reputation of the school that the pressure for places led to the introduction of a competitive examination.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 41, (Heinemann: London)</ref> In 1869 the upper school took possession of the current site, referred to as the ''\"New College\"'', but it was not until Founder's Day (21 June) 1870 that the new college was officially opened by the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]].<ref name=\"GG45\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 45, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The new college buildings, sited in the 24 hectares (60 acres) of Dulwich Common, were designed by [[Charles Barry, Jr.]] (the eldest son of Sir [[Charles Barry]]).<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 44, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The lower school alone continued to occupy the Old College in Dulwich Village from 1870 until it was moved to its new (and current) premises in East Dulwich in 1887.<ref name=\"DD32\" />\n\nThe present school colours and school magazine (''The Alleynian'') were established in the 1860s and 1870s, as were school societies such as ''Debating'' and ''Natural Science''.<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 51, (Heinemann: London)</ref> By the time Canon Carver retired from the position of Master in 1882, Dulwich College was said to have expanded more rapidly in the previous 25 years than any other establishment<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 57, (Heinemann: London)</ref> and to be ''holding its own at universities'', to have ''won a large number of places of honour in the Indian and Home Civil Service'' and ''at [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|the Royal Military College of Woolwich]]'' and to be well represented among ''the public schools medals of the [[Royal Geographic Society]] and the prizes of the Art Schools of the [[Royal Academy]]''.<ref>''The Times'', 11 January 1883</ref>\n\n=== 1882: Separation from Alleyn's School; the college's 'Golden Age' ===\nDespite its excellent reputation, the college was the focus of pressure by the Charity Commissioners and other parties (including the Board of Governors and the outlying parishes named in Edward Alleyn's will) to reorganise it and divert much of its endowment to other schemes. The Master, Canon Carver, resisted these pressures for many years, finally winning an appeal in 1876 at the highest possible level (the [[Privy Council]]) where [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]] ruled in his favour. In 1882, the [[Charity Commission]]ers finally issued a scheme that Canon Carver found acceptable. This passed into law by Act of Parliament and resulted in the Upper and Lower schools being officially split into separate institutions. The Upper School became Dulwich College (''officially'' for the first time) and the Lower became [[Alleyn's School]].<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 55, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Both schools remained within the [[Alleyn's College|Alleyn's College of God's Gift]] charitable foundation (along with [[James Allen's Girls' School]], St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School, and the three Central Foundation schools in [[Finsbury]] and [[Bishopsgate]]). \n\nTwo Boards of Governors came into being. Both Dulwich College and Alleyn's School were to be managed by the college Governors who also administered the Chapel and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery|Picture Gallery]]. The Estates and Almshouses were placed in the hands of the Estates Governors. The foundation and the college are still governed under the same arrangement. The Archbishop of Canterbury's position as Visitor was also changed to that of Honorary Visitor of Alleyn's College of God's Gift, his powers being vested in the Charity Commissioners.<ref>Ormiston, T. L., (1926), ''Dulwich College Register'',page 4, (J J Keliher & Co Ltd: London)</ref> Dulwich College's income is derived from the contributions by the Estates Governors, among whom the College Governors are well represented (having eight of the twenty five places)<ref>Darby, W., (1966), ''Dulwich Discovered'', p.33, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref> Canon Carver retired at this point, being the first headmaster to be both appointed and retired by Act of Parliament.<ref>Darby, W., (1967), ''Dulwich: A Place in History'', p.33, (William Darby: Dulwich)</ref>\n\nCanon Carver was said to have given the college a body, but [[Arthur Herman Gilkes]] (Master from 1885\u20131914) to have given it a soul, with his noble ideals of scholarship and public service. He founded the College Mission in a poverty-stricken part of Camberwell.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History, 1616\u20132008'', pages 177\u2013188 (Dulwich College: London).</ref>\n\n[[London County Council]] scholars were admitted to Dulwich College from 1903. The college was saved from [[bankruptcy]] by the 'Dulwich College Experiment' or 'Gilkes Experiment', the work of A H Gilkes's son Christopher Gilkes (Master from 1941\u20131953), the forerunner of the state 'Assisted Places Scheme', by which the majority of boys selected to attend the college had their fees paid by local councils. This resulted in an academic 'Renaissance' of the college which came to a climax from the late 1950s when the college was at the forefront of the schools winning awards on entry to Oxford and Cambridge.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 273\u2013277 (Dulwich College: London).</ref>\n\n==School arms==\n[[File:Alleyn'sCrest.jpg|upright|left|Original Alleyn Crest]]When Edward Alleyn founded the school he was awarded a [[coat of arms]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. This was used by the school until, in 1935, it was decreed by the [[College of Arms]] that it was the exclusive property of Edward Alleyn and his family.<ref name=\"GG117\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 117, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The new arms granted by the College of Arms were very similar to the old ones retaining most of the features.

First, it represents Alleyn's charitable intentions, and second it recalls Alleyn's famous speech, written by [[Ben Jonson]], when he presented King James I with the flaming heart of London during ''The Magnificent Entertainment'', involving a procession through the streets and through triumphal arches by which the [[City of London]] welcomed King James I from [[Scotland]] in 1604. The lower portion of the shield incorporates the original shield being an argent (silver) background on which are placed a chevron (bent bar) dividing three [[cinquefoil]]s gules (red five pointed stars).<ref>Stanley W Wells, (2002), ''Shakespeare Survey'', page 172, (Cambridge University Press)</ref>\n\n==Houses==\n[[File:New Buildings at Dulwich College.

Those up to the age of sixteen (Year 11) live in ''\"The Orchard\"'', whilst boys of the ''Upper School'' (Year 12 and Year 13) live in either ''\"Ivyholme\"'' or ''\"Blew House\"''.<ref name=\"DC Board\" />\n\nAfter the college was reconstituted in 1857 most of the boys were day-boys but provision was made for boarders, and the Governors licensed three boarding houses to be kept by respectable ladies in the village (hence they were then known as ''dames' houses''). A fourth was added soon afterwards.<ref name=\"GG 35\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 35, (Heinemann: London)</ref> The number of functioning boarding houses has fluctuated between one and five since that point and in total there have been six different houses:\n\n; Blew House : Now one of the two senior houses, it was moved to its current position on College Road in the 1930s on the site of what had previously been the Master's garden (who had been residing in the south block of the New College). The original Blew House is called Old Blew House and still stands in Dulwich.<ref name=\"GG 118\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 118, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Blew House was the only house to remain in commission throughout the Second World War for Alleynians and became a senior house at this point.<ref name=\"GG 137\" />\n\n; Ivyholme : The second of the two current senior houses, it too was moved to its current position on College Road in the 1930s.<ref name=\"GG 118\" /> It was bombed during the Second World War<ref name=\"GG 128\" /> but was re-opened soon after as a senior house. During the Second World War whilst housing students of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (who were going through a crash course in languages sponsored by the [[War Office]]) it was also run by the Master of the College.<ref name=\"GG 135\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 135, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n; The Orchard : This is the only junior house still functioning as a boarding house. It was bombed during the Second World War<ref name=\"GG 128\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 128, (Heinemann: London)</ref> but was re-opened as one of two junior houses very close to the war ending.<ref name=\"GG 137\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 137, (Heinemann: London)</ref> During the Second World War, like Ivyholme, it housed students of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] who were going through a crash course in languages sponsored by the [[War Office]].<ref name=\"GG 135\" />\n\n; Elm Lawn : This was the house in which P.G.Wodehouse once boarded prior to it becoming a junior house.<ref name=\"GG 135\" /> After the Second World War it re-opened as a junior house, along with ''The Orchard''.<ref name=\"GG 137\" /> In 1949 the boys of Elm Lawn were moved into Bell House (see below) and it became the home of the Master of the College, and still is today.<ref name=\"GG 138\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 138, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n; Bell House : This eighteenth century building close to [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] became the family home of the Master of the College in 1927<ref name=\"GG 108\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, page 108, (Heinemann: London)</ref> who until then had lived with his family in the south block of the '''New College'''. The Master moved out of this premises during the Second World War into Ivyholme. When Ivyholme reopened as a boarding house it was decided that the Master should not return to Bell House because it was too large for the purposes of a family residence. The Master moved to The Chestnuts and then in 1949 to Elm Lawn.<ref name=\"GG 138\" /> Meanwhile, Bell House was adapted as a boarding house and became the second junior house, replacing Elm Lawn. In 1993 it was returned to private ownership, as the college recognised the lack of need for a second junior boarding house.\n\n; Carver House : As the number of boys requiring boarding increased towards the end of the Second World War a fifth house was created by converting the cricket pavilion. It was named after Canon Carver, first Master of the reconstituted College, but it did not last long in this form.<ref name=\"GG 137\" />\n\n====Boarding house clubs and colours====\n[[File:DulwichCollegeBoardingHouseColours.png|thumb|upright|right|The ties denoting from left to right, Blew house colours, Caerulean Club membership, Ivyholme colours, and Zodiac Club membership]]The colour system (for more detail see ''[[#School uniform and colours|School uniform and colours]]'' below) also extended to the Boarding Houses due to their particular impact on college life.<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 pages 222\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 222, (Heinemann: London)</ref> At one time, Bell, Ivyholme and Blew, had their own sports teams and their own distinct colours. Those awarded colours could wear ties and caps and for outstanding contribution the house blazer was awarded. Boarders with no colours could wear black ties to distinguish them from day boys. \n\nToday, senior boys can still become members of the Zodiac and Caerulean Clubs for Ivyholme and Blew respectively. The house captain, who is automatically a member of the club,  controls membership of clubs, and such membership confers the right to wear a special tie. When, across the school, the uniform was standardised in 1970, the tradition of the house blazers disappeared save for the House Captain who, if he has earned full school colours, may wear the house blazer.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 page 303\">J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', page 303 (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n\n====Gordon Bowl====\nThis trophy was presented to the college prior to the Second World War. It was a trophy competed for by boarders only presented by an Old Alleynian, A.G.Gordon. It was originally competed for by the four boarding houses (when there was no junior/senior distinction), but after the Second World War only by the senior houses Blew House and Ivyholme until 2017, the year which Orchard were readded to the competition. It is still played for today.<ref name=\"GG223 224\">Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, pages 223\u2013224, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n===Day Houses===\nAll boys are members of one of eight [[House system|day houses]] or ''Athletic Houses'' as they were originally known.<ref name=\"GG223 224\" /> The Houses were the brainchild of W.D. ('Scottie') Gibbon, an assistant master and rugby coach.<ref name=\"GG223 224\" /> The idea was decided upon in 1919 and in the school magazine, ''The Alleynian'', of March 1920 the process was described. The division would be into six houses to be named after ''distinguished Englishmen of the Elizabethan period''<ref name=\"AllLent2006 2\">''The Alleynian'', Lent 2006, page 2</ref> (see table below). The name of Shakespeare was omitted as being considered pre-eminent.<ref name=\"GPS 94\">Webster F.A.M., (1937), ''Our Great Public Schools'', page 92, (Butler & Tanner: London)</ref>  Upon their original creation Boarders and Day Boys were divided thus: ''Grenville'' included ''Blew House'', ''Marlowe'' included ''The Orchard'', Spenser included ''Elm Lawn'', ''Sidney'' included ''Ivyholme'' and two entirely Day-boy houses were created: ''Drake'' and ''Raleigh''. In 1982 two more Houses (Jonson and Howard) were added due to an increased College roll. \n \nThe athletic houses were created to improve the standard of games at the college, which had deteriorated during the First World War. Before the creation of these houses, the most keenly anticipated matches were the '''Boarders vs Day-Boys''' or the '''Prefects vs The Rest of the School'''. The Athletic Houses produced, and still produce, '''Big Sides''' and '''Little Sides''' for competition.<ref name=\"GG223 224\" /> Big Sides are Houses teams that include players who also represent the school and Little are House sides that do not include school sporting representatives.\nA boy's house is decided randomly or through family connection where possible. The houses continue to compete in sporting and cultural competitions (such as music, drama, chess and debating).<ref name=\"AllLent2006 2\" /> The '''Cock House''' ''Shield'' or ''Cup'' are presented to the leading House at the end of the school year taking into account all competitions.<ref name=\"GPS 94\" />\n\n== School uniform and colours ==\nThe dress code for pupils of Dulwich College depends on the boarding or day houses a boy might belong to, the sports teams represented, or whether a boy has attained school colours or become a prefect. Alleyn had prescribed the clothing of poor scholars to be ''\"a white calico surplice, a long coat such as that worn by [[Christ's Hospital]] boys, of good cloth of sad (dark and sober) colour, a bodice lined with canvas, skirts with cotton lining, canvas shirts, white cotton drawers, knitted stockings, shoes and belt, a girdle and a black cap.\"''<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 47 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> This is how boys were dressed for over two centuries, until the new foundation in 1857. \n\nIn 1863, the Master, [[Alfred Carver]], decreed the uniform should be \"Short tunic buttoned to the chin, trousers of an Oxford mixture, an ordinary rifle cap with a broad band and narrow peak, and a dark coloured [[Inverness cape]] for winter.\"<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 122 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> Under Carver, boys still wore waistcoats of varied hues and \"the latest creations in neckties\". This was suppressed in 1883 by the new Master, [[James Welldon|Welldon]], whose first rule on arrival was that the boys should wear uniform, a forerunner of the [[subfusc]] jackets of today.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 166 (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n[[File:DulwichCollegeWhiteBlazer.png|thumb|left|upright|Example of the white blazer only awarded to the most prominent sportsmen]]\nThe colours of the college, blue and black, according to tradition are based on [[Marlborough College]] although [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]] is more likely the model. It is known that in 1864 caps were introduced, with cross ribbons of purple soon altered to blue. The college arms were added in 1875.<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 page 50\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 50, (Heinemann: London)</ref> From this time, the colour scheme arose for rewarding achievement, limited at first to sport with blazers for the 1st and 2nd team of the major sports, rugby and cricket (as well as ties, caps and squares). The minor sports also had colours, although these did not extend to a full blazer. Rather, athletics, fives, shooting, boxing, tennis, swimming, gymnastics, fencing and waterpolo had blazer badges (plus caps and ties). Additionally, the boarding houses, which historically had a disproportionate effect on the sporting life of the college, had their own boarding house colours. ''(For more details see [[Dulwich College#Boarding Houses|Boarding Houses]])''<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 pages 222\"/>\nBy 1909 there were seventeen different caps plus a variety of blazers. The striped jackets for prominent sportsmen also conferred certain privileges, such as having the right to proceed first through the doors of centre block. \n\nFurther emphasising status were special caps for major sports colours. Rugby had a pie-shaped porker with tassels. Likewise, prefects wearing caps quartered in blue and black, could unbutton their jackets and keep their hands in their trousers.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 303\"/> The most exclusive items took precedence even over the striped blazers of members of the 1st teams for major sports. The very best rugby players were on rare occasions awarded the rugby honours cap, and perhaps the most fabled item of all, still displayed in the college's Wodehouse library, was the white blazer. This was only awarded on the recommendation of the Field Sports Committee (see [[Dulwich College#Sport|Sport section]]) with the essential requirement being that a boy be a member of both the Cricket 1st XI and the Rugby 1st XV ''and'' display prominence in a minor sport (e.g. boxing, fives, squash, fencing, shooting).<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 227\"/>\n \nThis uniform changed little till the 1960s (save for the arms change in 1935, and the addition of the house colours on sports shirts following the athletics houses foundation in 1920). By the 60s, boys (other than prefects and those with sporting honours) had to wear a black jacket and either grey flannels or pinstripe trousers in the Autumn and Winter terms. Shortly after the start of the Summer term, an announcement would be made that henceforth, for the rest of the term, blazers (navy blue with a white embroidered DC in gothic script) and grey flannels would be worn, along with the option of boaters. The traditional cap which was balanced on the back of the head was to be worn when in uniform off school premises and (no doubt because of its precarious perch) boys would \"cap\" those to whom they would otherwise have raised their caps. \"Capping\" involved touching the College arms on the cap with the left hand.<ref>Personal recollections, 1955\u201362)</ref> The 1960s saw the demise of caps and boaters and a reduction in the variety of blazers,<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 page 50\"/> as well as the end of shirts with separate collars.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 page 303\"/>\n\n== Co-curricular ==\n\n=== Sport ===\nWhen Arthur Herman Gilkes became Master, he adhered to Carver's belief that the physical organisation of the school should be based on the principle that as far as possible management should be in the hands of the boys. Therefore, he continued the tradition of the general running of games being entrusted to a Field Sports Board (sometimes referred to as the Field Sports Committee), composed of the \"school captain,  captains of cricket, football (rugby), gymnastics, the baths (swimming), fencing, [[fives]], athletics sports, boxing and shooting\".<ref>Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', pages 221\u2013222, (Heinemann: London)</ref> Gilkes had it that the only masters with authorised status with regards to games were the captain of the Rifle Corps, and treasurer of the Sports Board. By 1894 there no more masters on the Field Sports Committee.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 180 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> The Board at the time controlled the appointment of captains and had some say in the style of blazers that could be worn as uniform.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 374 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> It was the Field Sports Committee, for example, that governed the award of the college's most prestigious colours, the white blazer. The system today is very different with assistant masters now being in charge of games, and acting more as coaches.<ref>J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 334 (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n\nColours for sporting achievement were the first such colours to be established at the college (see [[#School uniform and colours|School uniform and colours]] below). Originally colours consisted of blazers for the 1st and 2nd team of the major sports, rugby and cricket (as well as ties, caps and squares) and colours for minor sports, (not extending to a full blazer but blazer badges plus caps and ties).<ref name=\"Hodges, S 1981 pages 222\"/> Caps were also available, such as for rugby, the pie shaped porker<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 303\">J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 303 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> and more exclusive items such as the rare rugby honours cap, and the white blazer, only awarded on the recommendation of the Field Sports Committee with the essential requirement being that a boy be a member of both the Cricket 1st XI and the Rugby 1st XV ''and'' display prominence in a minor sport.<ref name=\"R Piggott 2008 pages 227\">J R Piggott (2008), ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 227 (Dulwich College: London)</ref> Testament to the judgment of the committee are the careers of certain alumni who received this blazer such as [[Trevor Bailey]] the [[England cricket]] all-rounder, who was so awarded because he was also a distinguished squash player.\n\nThe college still divides sport into Major and Minor. The major sports have always included rugby and cricket in the Michaelmas and summer terms respectively and for many decades just these two were deemed as major. In the twentieth century, [[field hockey]] became a major sport in the Lent term, having been introduced in 1953. [[Soccer]], a minor sport since it was allowed in 1970, became of equal status to hockey in 2000. A raft of minor sports have also been recognised at the college for well over a century in many cases. Minor sports have included athletics from 1864; Fives from 1894 (effectively ended by the courts being destroyed by enemy bombs in the Second World War); shooting from 1878 (less applicable due to safety regulations and the loss of the .22 range); boxing from 1879 (abandoned in the 1960s but with martial arts now filling the void), tennis from 1880 (although banned during A H Gilkes' time); swimming from 1883 with the college being one of the first schools to erect a swimming pool; gymnastics from 1891; fencing (like boxing, saw a demise in the 1960s but still has a representative team); squash and water polo. The school also has teams for golf; rowing (a recent introduction in 1991 \u2013 the school now owns a boathouse on the [[River Thames]]); badminton; basketball; croquet; cycling; skiing; table tennis and rugby fives. The facilities, which include a sports centre complex, courts for most racquet sports, an athletic track, tennis courts, a swimming pool and acres of playing fields, cater to almost all sporting requirements.<ref>Terry Walsh ''Games and Sports'', in J R Piggott's, ''Dulwich College, a History 1616\u20132008'', pages 334\u2013355,  (2008) (Dulwich College: London)</ref>\n\n===Rugby===\n[[File:DulwichCollegeRugbyHonoursCap.png|thumb|right|Example of the rugby honours cap, which, until around 1969, was awarded to only the very best players]]The major sport of the Michaelmas term, Dulwich College rugby has long enjoyed a powerful reputation. The school began its rugby tradition with a 1\u20130 victory over [[City of London School]] in 1859, 12 years before the founding of the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Since that time the school has had upwards of 30 Old Alleynians play at full international level, with more playing at schoolboy international level, national reserve and professional club rugby as well as representatives for invitational sides such as [[Barbarian FC|the Barbarians]]. \n\nThree [[British and Irish Lions]] have emerged from the college. 1909 featured an unbeaten first XV which contained five future internationals dubbed the 'Famous Five'. Between 2012 and 2014, Dulwich College won the Natwest Schools Cup (previously known as the Daily Mail Cup) three times in a row. Then in 2017 secured an historic double, becoming the first ever team to win both the schools cup (in the years mentioned) and the Champions Trophy, the highest Tier of School Cup Rugby.<ref>Jan Piggot, ''Dulwich College: A History, 1616\u20132008'', 2008, {{ISBN|0-9539493-2-X}}</ref>\n\n=== CCF ===\nDulwich College has a well-established [[Combined Cadet Force]] contingent that has been running since when the organisation was founded in 1859.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://combinedcadetforce.org.uk/|title=Homepage {{!}} Combined Cadet Force|last=Putty|first=Electric|date=2017-06-02|website=Combined Cadet Force|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref> The cadets can choose between three sections: Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force, with most cadets joining in year 9. Since 2018 the DCCF has accepted female cadets from [[JAGS]] (James Allen Girls School) .The DCCCF regularly conducts battlecraft trips, flying days at RAF Benson and expeditions to the arctic or desert. The DCCCF are Gold medal winners in the Cambrian Patrol and have won both the Guthrie cup, London district shooting competition, 1st place regional first aid, 2nd place in National First Aid (making the first aid team the best in England and Wales) and the [[Ground Training Competition|Air Squadron Trophy Competition]]. They came first both regionally and nationally in 2020. As of 2020 the RAF section is the most decorated section in Britain and the DCCF is also the most decorated contingent nationally.\n\n=== Scouts ===\nDulwich College has a scout troop which has two patrols within it. It runs from year 6 to year 13 with both scouts and explorers. The troop is called the 25th Camberwell and has been running for over 80 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.25thcamberwell.org.uk/|title=25th CAMBERWELL SCOUTS & DULWICH EXPLORERS|website=25th CAMBERWELL SCOUTS & DULWICH EXPLORERS|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Dulwich College Union ===\nDulwich College has a large union for clubs and societies containing over 50 societies. There is a wide range of clubs ranging from Rocketry to History and the college used to have a Chicken society in which boys tended to the college's chickens. The clubs, and Union, are run by boys in Year 12 and 13 and contribute to their Duke of Edinburg awards. Most of these clubs and societies have their own personalised ties.\n\n==== Debating ====\nWithin the Dulwich College Union debating plays a large role. The Dulwich College society runs during the school terms but competes both nationally and internationally. The society runs from year 7 to 13 and has around 50 members. It has recently enjoyed great success, winning the Oxford Union Debating Competition in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Cambridge Union Schools Debating Competition in 2014 and 2015, and the ESU (English Speaking Union) Schools Mace Debating Competition, also in 2014 and 2015. It has also represented Team England and competed internationally against other national teams. It has also competed in Texas, Singapore and Stuttgart. Dulwich College is, therefore, ranked as one of the top debating schools in the UK (second only to St Paul's) and one of the best in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dulwich.org.uk/college/college-life/co-curricular/debating|title=Debating \u2013 Co-curricular \u2013 College Life \u2013 Dulwich College|website=www.dulwich.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820160544/http://www.dulwich.org.uk/college/college-life/co-curricular/debating|archive-date=20 August 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==School magazine==\nThe Dulwich College school magazine is called the ''Alleynian'', named after the school's founder Edward Alleyn. This magazine was first published in 1873, although the school's first magazine under the name the ''Dulwich College Magazine for School News and General Reading'' had been published in 1864 but only lasted for fourteen issues after its editor left for Cambridge University.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> ''The Alleynian'' was edited at one point by [[P.G.Wodehouse]] in his last year at the school.<ref name=\"GG82\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 82, (Heinemann: London)</ref>\n\n==Old Alleynians==\n{{main|List of Old Alleynians}}\n{{see also|Category:People educated at Dulwich College}}\n\nOld boys of Dulwich College are called \"Old Alleynians\", after the founder of the school. This is often abbreviated to ''\"O.A.\"'' as post-nominal letters in brackets in school publications or publications specifically concerning the school. The term should not be confused with \"Alleyn's Old Boys\" used for alumni of [[Alleyn's School]]. Current pupils of the school are known as Alleynians. Prior to around 1880, the terms \"Alleynian\" and \"Old Alleynian\" were not used and the pupils and ex-pupils were known as ''Dulwichians.''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Hodges, S, (1981), ''God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College'', page 49, (Heinemann: London)</ref> \n\nNotable Old Alleynians include [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]], [[P G Wodehouse|Sir P G Wodehouse]], [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Sir Edward George]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Michael Ondaatje]], David Thomson, [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Nigel Farage]], the cricketer [[Trevor Bailey]], [[C. S. Forester]] and the architect [[C. F. A. Voysey]].\n\n==Headmastership of Dulwich College==\nThe Head Master of Dulwich College is styled ''The Master of Dulwich College'', as laid out in the 1882 scheme of the Charity Commissioners. This continued a tradition of the Head of the college being called the ''Master'' since its foundation in 1619. The Foundation originally had a governing body consisting of a Master, Warden, four Fellows, and six Assistants made up of the two churchwardens of each of the three parishes of St Botolph's, Bishopsgate, of St Saviour's, Southwark, and of St Giles', Cripplegate. The Master was most senior, followed by the Warden and on vacancy of the Mastership, the Warden succeeded. By the 1857 Dulwich College Act the Master, Warden and Fellows were pensioned and the governance of the foundation switched to a body of nineteen Governors. However, the position of ''Master'' continued as the title of the Headmaster of the new Upper School, with an Undermaster as deputy. The 1882 Act (as a result of the Charity Commissioners scheme) abolished the office of Undermaster.<ref>Ormiston, T.

The community of Mangum began in 1882 when Henry Clay Sweet established it on land granted to A. S. Mangum by the state of Texas. The Mangum post office was established April 15, 1886. This part of Texas (old Greer County) was given to Oklahoma in 1896.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/> During Mangum's early days, the community's economy largely depended on very large cattle ranches owned or leased by land companies such as the Day Land and Cattle Company of Texas and the Franklyn Land and Cattle Company, an English syndicate.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/> During those very early days, the local cowboys called Mangum \"Tin City\" because so many tin cans were unrolled and nailed over the wooden planks that served as sidewalks.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nThe Kiser Salt Works, named for owner Ben Kiser and located on the Elm Fork of the Red River was one of the earliest production operations in what would become western Oklahoma.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/> {{efn|The Minerals Handbook suggests that salt production began about 1914 in Harmon County, Oklahoma (originally part of Old Greer County)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jI0oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA302&lpg=PA302&dq=Kiser+Salt+works&source=bl&ots=6l8qQPPQdy&sig=iSUHsxOSeGhqDefz9OKeIFTdUnE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj99dysoo7QAhVFxmMKHchxC_MQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false  ''Mineral Resources of the United States for 1914 - Part II.''p.301.] Available on Google Books.

By 1930, the population had expanded to 4,806 (the highest recorded in the U.S. census.

The community of Mangum began in 1882 when Henry Clay Sweet established it on land granted to A. S. Mangum by the state of Texas. The Mangum post office was established April 15, 1886. This part of Texas (old Greer County) was given to Oklahoma in 1896.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/> During Mangum's early days, the community's economy largely depended on very large cattle ranches owned or leased by land companies such as the Day Land and Cattle Company of Texas and the Franklyn Land and Cattle Company, an English syndicate.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/> During those very early days, the local cowboys called Mangum \"Tin City\" because so many tin cans were unrolled and nailed over the wooden planks that served as sidewalks.<ref name=\"hist\"/>\n\nThe Kiser Salt Works, named for owner Ben Kiser and located on the Elm Fork of the Red River was one of the earliest production operations in what would become western Oklahoma.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/> {{efn|The Minerals Handbook suggests that salt production began about 1914 in Harmon County, Oklahoma (originally part of Old Greer County)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jI0oAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA302&lpg=PA302&dq=Kiser+Salt+works&source=bl&ots=6l8qQPPQdy&sig=iSUHsxOSeGhqDefz9OKeIFTdUnE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj99dysoo7QAhVFxmMKHchxC_MQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&q&f=false  ''Mineral Resources of the United States for 1914 - Part II.''p.301.] Available on Google Books.

J. Doyle. The newspaper still publishes in the 21st Century. The brick plant, now owned by Jewett Scott, also still operates and has greatly expanded production.<ref name=\"EOHC-Mangum\"/>\n\nBy statehood, Mangum had a population of 2,672. It had two school buildings, an opera house and a county courthouse, listed in the National Register of Historical Places, NR 85000682. By 1930, the population had expanded to 4,806 (the highest recorded in the U.S. census.

It was featured in [[Oprah's Book Club]] for June 1998.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel takes place in Three Rivers, [[Connecticut]]. Dominick Birdsey's identical twin, Thomas Birdsey, suffers from paranoid [[schizophrenia]]. With medication, Thomas is able to live his life in relative peace and work at a coffee stand, but occasionally, he has severe episodes of his illness. Thinking he is making a sacrificial protest that will stop the [[Gulf War]], Thomas cuts off his own hand while at a public library. Dominick sees him through the ensuing decision not to attempt to reattach the hand, and makes efforts on his behalf to free him from what he knows to be an inadequate and depressing hospital for the dangerously mentally ill.\n\nIn the process, Dominick contemplates his own difficult life as Thomas's brother, his marriage to his gorgeous ex-wife, which ended after their only child died of [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome|SIDS]], and his ongoing hostility toward his stepfather. Dominick also displays classic symptoms of [[PTSD]], as a result of stressors in his adult life. First in Thomas's interests, and then for his own sake, he sees a therapist, Dr. Rubina Patel, an Indian psychologist, employed by the hospital. She helps Dominick come to understand Thomas's illness better and the family's accommodations or reactions to it.\n\nIn the course of Thomas's treatment, Dominick is covertly informed of sexual abuse taking place in the hospital, and helps to expose the perpetrators. He succeeds in getting Thomas released, but Thomas soon dies, apparently by suicide. After Thomas's death, Dominick discovers the identity of their birth father, who was part African American and part Native American\u2014a secret their mother had shared with Thomas, but not with him.\n\nIn the midst of this, Dominick is also reading the autobiography of his grandfather, Italian/Sicilian-born Domenico Tempesta, which discloses details about the legacy of twins in their family. Dominick learns about himself and his mother through learning about his grandfather.\n\nHe also learns that his live-in girlfriend, Joy, has been seeing a gentleman on the side, who is her bisexual half-uncle, and has also let him watch her and Dominick during sex on previous occasions. She is also [[HIV|HIV-positive]], having contracted it from her secret lover. She asks Dominick to raise her baby if she dies. At first Dominick resists, but later, after having found his way back into a relationship with his ex-wife, Dessa, they decide to remarry each other and adopt Joy's daughter.

It was featured in [[Oprah's Book Club]] for June 1998.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel takes place in Three Rivers, [[Connecticut]]. Dominick Birdsey's identical twin, Thomas Birdsey, suffers from paranoid [[schizophrenia]]. With medication, Thomas is able to live his life in relative peace and work at a coffee stand, but occasionally, he has severe episodes of his illness. Thinking he is making a sacrificial protest that will stop the [[Gulf War]], Thomas cuts off his own hand while at a public library. Dominick sees him through the ensuing decision not to attempt to reattach the hand, and makes efforts on his behalf to free him from what he knows to be an inadequate and depressing hospital for the dangerously mentally ill.\n\nIn the process, Dominick contemplates his own difficult life as Thomas's brother, his marriage to his gorgeous ex-wife, which ended after their only child died of [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome|SIDS]], and his ongoing hostility toward his stepfather. Dominick also displays classic symptoms of [[PTSD]], as a result of stressors in his adult life. First in Thomas's interests, and then for his own sake, he sees a therapist, Dr. Rubina Patel, an Indian psychologist, employed by the hospital. She helps Dominick come to understand Thomas's illness better and the family's accommodations or reactions to it.\n\nIn the course of Thomas's treatment, Dominick is covertly informed of sexual abuse taking place in the hospital, and helps to expose the perpetrators. He succeeds in getting Thomas released, but Thomas soon dies, apparently by suicide. After Thomas's death, Dominick discovers the identity of their birth father, who was part African American and part Native American\u2014a secret their mother had shared with Thomas, but not with him.\n\nIn the midst of this, Dominick is also reading the autobiography of his grandfather, Italian/Sicilian-born Domenico Tempesta, which discloses details about the legacy of twins in their family. Dominick learns about himself and his mother through learning about his grandfather.\n\nHe also learns that his live-in girlfriend, Joy, has been seeing a gentleman on the side, who is her bisexual half-uncle, and has also let him watch her and Dominick during sex on previous occasions. She is also [[HIV|HIV-positive]], having contracted it from her secret lover. She asks Dominick to raise her baby if she dies. At first Dominick resists, but later, after having found his way back into a relationship with his ex-wife, Dessa, they decide to remarry each other and adopt Joy's daughter. The book ends with Dominick able to cope with the considerable loss, failure, and sorrow in his personal and family history.\n\n==Characters==\n*Dominick Birdsey: Protagonist.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lamb|first=Wally|title=I Know This Much is True|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1998|isbn=978-0060391621|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n*Thomas Birdsey: Dominick's identical twin, a man with paranoid schizophrenia.\n*Dr. Patel: Thomas's psychologist at Hatch, Dominick's therapist.\n*Lisa Sheffer: Thomas's social worker, Dominick's friend.\n*Dessa Constantine: Dominick's ex-wife, whom he remarries.\n*Angela Birdsey: Dominick's and Dessa's baby daughter, dies of SIDS.\n*Concettina Ipolita Tempesta Birdsey: Thomas's and Dominick's mother, daughter of Domenico and Ignazia Tempesta.\n*Ray Birdsey: Thomas's and Dominick's stepfather.\n*Leo and Angie (Athena Constantine) Blood: Dominick's best friend, Dessa's younger sister.\n*Joy: Dominick's live-in girlfriend.\n*Tyffanie Rose: Joy's and Thad's biological daughter, and Dominick and Dessa's adopted daughter.\n*Thad: Joy's bisexual half-uncle and secret lover, Tyffanie Rose's father and great half-uncle.\n*Ralph Drinkwater: Penny Ann Drinkwater's twin and later found to be Thomas and Dominick's cousin.\n*Penny Ann Drinkwater: Ralph Drinkwater's twin, murdered as a small girl.\n*Domenico Onofrio Tempesta (1880\u20131949): Thomas's and Dominick's grandfather from Sicily.\n*Ignazia Tucci Tempesta (Violetta d'Annunzio): Dominick's beautiful grandmother from Pescara.\n*Prosperine Tucci (\"The Monkey\"): Ignazia's best friend and lover, loathed by Domenico Tempesta.\n*Pasquale Tempesta: Domenico Tempesta's younger brother.\n*Vincenzo Tempesta: youngest brother of Domenico Tempesta.\n*Concettina Ciccia: Dominick's great-grandmother; Domenico's mother\n*Alfio and Maricchia Ciccia: Domenico's maternal grandparents\n*Giacomo Tempesta: Domenico's father\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nIt was featured in [[Oprah's Book Club]] in 1998.\n\n== TV adaptation ==\n\n{{main article|I Know This Much Is True (miniseries)}}\n\nIn October 2018, [[Home Box Office|HBO]] announced they were planning a 6-episode limited-series TV adaptation with [[Mark Ruffalo]] set to appear in the roles of both Dominick and Thomas Birdsey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/mark-ruffalo-i-know-this-much-is-true-limited-series-book-derek-cianfrance-hbo-1202485616/|title=Mark Ruffalo Limited Series \u2018I Know This Much Is True\u2019 Gets HBO Green Light|first=Nellie Andreeva,Denise|last=Petski|date=18 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn January 15, 2020, HBO announced that the series will premiere in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Limited Series \"I Know This Much Is True,\" Starring Mark Ruffalo; Debuts This April, Exclusively on HBO|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/01/15/limited-series-i-know-this-much-is-true-starring-mark-ruffalo-debuts-this-april-exclusively-on-hbo-425215/20200115hbo09/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> \n\nOn March 1, 2020, HBO released a teaser trailer on [[YouTube]] for the limited-series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/tv-roundup-hbo-mark-ruffalo-i-know-this-much-is-true-date-1203521526/|title=TV News Roundup: HBO Sets Premiere Date for Mark Ruffalo\u2019s \u2018I Know This Much Is True\u2019 (Watch)|last=Murphy|first=J.
