It is home to swamps, prairies, and mountains due to the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] which end in the county, the [[Coosa River]] basin, and its proximity to the [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt Prairie]] that was long a center of cotton production.\n\n==History==\nBaker County was established on December 30, 1868, named for '''Alfred Baker,''' with its [[county seat]] at [[Grantville, Alabama|Grantville]]. Residents of the county petitioned the Alabama legislature for the renaming of their county; it was not something forced upon them.

According to the 1990 Census, African Americans constituted 9.9% of the county's voting age population.\" Although passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] enabled African Americans to register and vote, in Chilton County no African American was elected to the County Commission until the first cumulative voting election, held in 1988.<ref name=\"fair\"/>\n\nAfrican Americans in Alabama had been essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] by the 1901 state constitution, which required payment of a [[poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and qualification by a [[literacy test]] in order to register to vote. Discriminatory in practice as administered by white officials, this system excluded most blacks from the state's political system for decades in the 20th century before Congress passed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Since then, African Americans were able finally to register and vote in the county and state for the first time since the late 19th century.<ref name=\"fair\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=531 Jason Kirksey, Richard Engstrom and Edward Still, \"Cumulative Voting in an Alabama County/ ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' and New Election Systems\", \"Chapter Three: Full Representation in Local Elections\"], ''Voting and Democracy Report: 1995'', in ''Voting Rights Review'' of the Southern Regional Council, reprinted at FairVote website</ref>\n\nIn counties in which there is a minority population and members are elected [[at-large]] or by single-member districts, minorities may be unable to elect representatives in a system dominated by the majority. The adoption of cumulative voting in Chilton County has enabled the minority to elect candidates of their choice by pooling their votes. Bobby Agee was elected as a Chilton County Commissioner in 1988 and again in the second cumulative voting election in 1992.<ref name=\"fair\"/> Cumulative voting depends on a multi-seat election, whether [[at-large]] or by district. \"The cumulative options provide a minority of voters an opportunity to concentrate their support for a candidate or candidates more effectively than they can under the more traditional voting rules used in this country.\"<ref name=\"fair\"/> In 2014, the county commission had an African-American commissioner among its seven members. However, in 2018, the county commissioners were all white males.<ref>https://chiltoncounty.org/commission/</ref>\n\nThe commission hires a County Administrator to handle daily management of county business.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:1em 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%;\"\n\n|+ '''Chilton County vote<br /> by party in presidential elections <ref name=\"DL\">{{cite web|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}</ref>'''\n|-\n!

The adoption of cumulative voting in Chilton County has enabled the minority to elect candidates of their choice by pooling their votes. Bobby Agee was elected as a Chilton County Commissioner in 1988 and again in the second cumulative voting election in 1992.<ref name=\"fair\"/> Cumulative voting depends on a multi-seat election, whether [[at-large]] or by district. \"The cumulative options provide a minority of voters an opportunity to concentrate their support for a candidate or candidates more effectively than they can under the more traditional voting rules used in this country.\"<ref name=\"fair\"/> In 2014, the county commission had an African-American commissioner among its seven members.

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. \n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. Precipitation intensity is high, and it is a warm continent. Warm climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. \n\n==Temperatures==\n{{See also|Subtropical ridge}}\n[[File: Africa temperature.png|thumb|left|Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa]]\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.<ref>Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the [[subtropical ridge]] with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more.\n\nOwing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the [[tropical climate zone|intertropical zone]] between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent.\n\n==Temperatures==\n{{See also|Subtropical ridge}}\n[[File: Africa temperature.png|thumb|left|Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa]]\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.<ref>Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

It grossed $306 million worldwide, becoming the [[2020 in film#Highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of 2020]],<ref name=\"Top Movies Worldwide 2020\" /> while also becoming the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time in the US box office.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words.-->\n[[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] blue hedgehog who can run at [[supersonic speed]]s, finds himself sought after by a tribe of [[echidnas]] for his power. His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that can create portals to other planets, using one to send him to Earth while she protects him from the echidnas. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of [[Green Hill Zone|Green Hills]], [[Montana]], but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, unaware the pair are planning to relocate to [[San Francisco]] soon, as Tom has been hired by the [[San Francisco Police Department]].\n\nOne night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that knocks out power across the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Roboticist and scientific genius [[Doctor Eggman|Doctor Robotnik]] is enlisted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who hides in the Wachowskis' shed. Tom discovers Sonic and accidentally shoots him with a tranquilizer, causing him to send his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the Wachowskis' house and the two flee. As the pair evade Robotnik, who labels Tom a [[domestic terrorist]], they slowly bond, with Tom learning about Sonic's desire for a real friend.\n\nRobotnik comes across one of Sonic's quills, discovering the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. As he tracks them down, Tom discusses his plans to leave Green Hills, which Sonic disapproves of. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, an explosion injures Sonic. Arriving at San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who revives him. While Tom explains about their situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. The group soon head to the roof of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]], where Sonic's bag of rings landed, and recover them. Robotnik arrives in a hovercraft and attacks them, forcing Sonic to use a ring to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills.\n\nSonic flees from Robotnik, who uses the power of Sonic's quill to match his speed. The two engage in a chase across the world, ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik incapacitates Sonic, but Tom intervenes, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Overcoming Robotnik, Sonic defeats him by sending him to another planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The US government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill and having lost his sanity, begins plotting his revenge. On Earth, [[Tails (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Tails]], a twin-tailed fox from Sonic's world, emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as the voice of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]: An anthropomorphic blue hedgehog with [[superhuman speed]] who is on the run from Robotnik and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].

[[Michealene Risley]], the newly appointed consumer products director who helped greenlight ''Adventures'', negotiated with several [[Hollywood]] producers. [[Sega]] CEO [[Tom Kalinske]], however, was wary of damaging the brand, citing the commercial and critical failures of the ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' films. Despite Kalinske's concerns, Sega was enthusiastic about a film adaptation. In August 1994, Sega struck a development deal with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and Trilogy Entertainment Group, with [[Pen Densham]] as the executive producer of the film.<ref name=\"WondersoftheWorld\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-that-never-got-made/ |title=The Sonic The Hedgehog Movie That Never Got Made |last=Owen |first=Luke |date=February 10, 2020 |work=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=November 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161101125431/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-director-tim-miller-developing-sonic-hedgehog-movie-sony-942661 |archive-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMGM and Sega hired [[Richard Jefferies (screenwriter)|Richard Jefferies]], an associate of Risley from her days at [[Marvel Comics]], to write a [[film treatment]].

Jefferies' treatment, entitled ''Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World'', was submitted in May 1995. While the draft received a positive response among MGM and Sega executives, Sega COO [[Shinobu Toyoda]] suggested Kalinske replace Robotnik with a meaner villain.

In the film, Sonic teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski to find his lost rings and escape Dr. Robotnik.\n\nDevelopment for a film began in the 1990s, but did not go beyond the planning stage until [[Sony Pictures]] acquired the film rights in 2013. Production involved the collaboration of [[Sega Sammy]]'s Japanese studio [[Marza Animation Planet]], with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in [[Vancouver]] and on [[Vancouver Island]].

His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that can create portals to other planets, using one to send him to Earth while she protects him from the echidnas. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of [[Green Hill Zone|Green Hills]], [[Montana]], but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, unaware the pair are planning to relocate to [[San Francisco]] soon, as Tom has been hired by the [[San Francisco Police Department]].\n\nOne night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that knocks out power across the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Roboticist and scientific genius [[Doctor Eggman|Doctor Robotnik]] is enlisted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who hides in the Wachowskis' shed. Tom discovers Sonic and accidentally shoots him with a tranquilizer, causing him to send his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the Wachowskis' house and the two flee. As the pair evade Robotnik, who labels Tom a [[domestic terrorist]], they slowly bond, with Tom learning about Sonic's desire for a real friend.\n\nRobotnik comes across one of Sonic's quills, discovering the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. As he tracks them down, Tom discusses his plans to leave Green Hills, which Sonic disapproves of. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, an explosion injures Sonic. Arriving at San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who revives him. While Tom explains about their situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. The group soon head to the roof of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]], where Sonic's bag of rings landed, and recover them. Robotnik arrives in a hovercraft and attacks them, forcing Sonic to use a ring to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills.\n\nSonic flees from Robotnik, who uses the power of Sonic's quill to match his speed. The two engage in a chase across the world, ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik incapacitates Sonic, but Tom intervenes, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Overcoming Robotnik, Sonic defeats him by sending him to another planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The US government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill and having lost his sanity, begins plotting his revenge. On Earth, [[Tails (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Tails]], a twin-tailed fox from Sonic's world, emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as the voice of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]: An anthropomorphic blue hedgehog with [[superhuman speed]] who is on the run from Robotnik and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].

[[Michealene Risley]], the newly appointed consumer products director who helped greenlight ''Adventures'', negotiated with several [[Hollywood]] producers. [[Sega]] CEO [[Tom Kalinske]], however, was wary of damaging the brand, citing the commercial and critical failures of the ''[[Super Mario Bros.

In August 1994, Sega struck a development deal with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and Trilogy Entertainment Group, with [[Pen Densham]] as the executive producer of the film.<ref name=\"WondersoftheWorld\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-that-never-got-made/ |title=The Sonic The Hedgehog Movie That Never Got Made |last=Owen |first=Luke |date=February 10, 2020 |work=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=November 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20161101125431/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-director-tim-miller-developing-sonic-hedgehog-movie-sony-942661 |archive-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMGM and Sega hired [[Richard Jefferies (screenwriter)|Richard Jefferies]], an associate of Risley from her days at [[Marvel Comics]], to write a [[film treatment]].

Jefferies' treatment, entitled ''Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World'', was submitted in May 1995. While the draft received a positive response among MGM and Sega executives, Sega COO [[Shinobu Toyoda]] suggested Kalinske replace Robotnik with a meaner villain.

Based on the differences in structure, there are two types of inflatable penile implants: two-piece and three-piece IPPs. Both types of inflatable devices are filled with sterile [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] which is pumped into cylinders when in process. The cylinders are implanted into the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|cavernous body of the penis]]. The pump system is attached to the cylinders and placed in the [[scrotum]].<ref name=\"Chung\" /> Three-piece implants have a separate large reservoir connected to the pump. The reservoir is commonly placed in the [[retropubic space]] (Retzius' space), however other locations have also been described, such as between the [[Transverse abdominal muscle|transverse muscle]] and [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus muscle]]. Three-piece implants provide more desirable rigidity and girth of the penis resembling natural erection. Additionally, due to the presence of a large reservoir, three-piece implants provide full flaccidity of the penis when deflated, thus bringing more comfort than two-piece inflatable and malleable implants.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\" />\n\nThe saline solution is pumped manually from the reservoir into bilateral chambers of cylinders implanted in the shaft of the penis, which replaces the non- or minimally-functioning erectile tissue. This produces an erection. The [[glans penis|glans of the penis]], however, remains unaffected. Ninety to ninety-five percent of inflatable prostheses produce erections suitable for [[sexual intercourse]]. In the United States, the inflatable prosthesis has largely replaced the malleable one, due to its lower rate of infections, high device survival rate and 80-90% satisfaction rate.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perito|first1=Paul|title=Penile Implants|url=https://peritourology.com/penile-implants/|website=PeritoUrology.com|publisher=Perito Urology|accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first IPP prototype presented in 1975 by Scott and colleagues was a three-piece prosthesis (two cylinders, two pumps and a fluid reservoir). Since then, the IPP has undergone multiple modifications and improvements for device reliability and durability, including change in the chemical material used in implant manufacturing, using hydrophilic and antibiotic eluting coatings to reduce the rates of infections, introducing one-touch release etc.<ref name=\"Chung\" /> Surgical techniques used for the implantation of penile prostheses have also improved along with evolution of the device.

Based on the differences of structure, there are two types of inflatable penile implants: two-piece and three-piece IPPs. Both types of inflatable devices are filled with sterile [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] which is pumped into cylinders when in process. The cylinders are implanted into the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|cavernous body of the penis]]. The pump system is attached to cylinders and placed in the [[scrotum]].<ref name=\"Chung\" /> Three-piece implants have a separate large reservoir connected to the pump. The reservoir is commonly placed in the [[retropubic space]] (Retzius' space), however other locations have also been described, such as between the [[Transverse abdominal muscle|transverse muscle]] and [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus muscle]]. Three-piece implants provide more desirable rigidity and girth of the penis resembling natural erection. Additionally, due to the presence of a large reservoir, three-piece implants provide full flaccidity of the penis when deflated, thus bringing more comfort than two-piece inflatable and malleable implants.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\" />\n\nThe saline solution is pumped manually from the reservoir into bilateral chambers of cylinders implanted in the shaft of the penis, which replaces the non- or minimally-functioning erectile tissue. This produces an erection. The [[glans penis|glans of the penis]], however, remains unaffected. Ninety to ninety-five percent of inflatable prostheses produce erections suitable for [[sexual intercourse]]. In the United States, the inflatable prosthesis has largely replaced the malleable one, due to its lower rate of infections, high device survival rate and 80-90% satisfaction rate.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perito|first1=Paul|title=Penile Implants|url=https://peritourology.com/penile-implants/|website=PeritoUrology.com|publisher=Perito Urology|accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first IPP prototype presented in 1975 by Scott and colleagues was a three-piece prosthesis (two cylinders, two pumps and a fluid reservoir). Since that, the IPP has undergone multiple modifications and improvements for the device reliability and durability, including change in chemical material used in implant manufacturing, using hydrophilic and antibiotic eluting coatings to reduce the rates of infections, introducing one-touch release, etc.<ref name=\"Chung\" /> Surgical techniques used for the implantation of penile prostheses have also improved along with evolution of the device.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop.

In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match.

In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the grave, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show will feature a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\n====Main event====\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.
