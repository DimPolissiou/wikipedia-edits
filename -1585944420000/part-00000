The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A.

The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

Meanwhile, he repeatedly and rather forcefully favors its analyses over Sen's.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1985|pp= 18, 53, 57 |quote=In my opinion the Famine Commission wrote an excellent report. They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses. They entered into their study with no preconceived ideas as to whether it was a FAD or a distribution famine and they reached a conclusion that was not in accordance with the official view (p. 18). }} British accusations that Indian officials were responsible began as early as 1943, as an editorial in ''The Statesman'' on 5&nbsp;October noted disapprovingly.{{sfn |\u00d3&nbsp;Gr\u00e1da |2015 |p=57}}\n\nPaul Greenough stands somewhat apart from other analysts by emphasising a pattern of victimization. In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S.

The \"test\" aspect arose because there was an assumption that if relatively large numbers of people took the offer, that indicated that famine conditions were prevalent.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015 |p=29 }}  Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=553}} Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices,{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=545}} but in practice gave little help to the rural poor, instead placing them into direct purchasing competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=559}} Thus from the beginning of the crisis until around August 1943, private charity was the principal form of relief available to the very poor.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|p=38}}\n\nAccording to Paul Greenough, the Provincial Government of Bengal delayed its relief efforts primarily because they had no idea how to deal with a provincial rice market crippled by the interaction of man-made shocks,{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |pp=127\u2013128|ps=&nbsp;\"Finally, and perhaps most compellingly, responsible officials in the Revenue and Civil Supplies ministries simply did not know how to proceed with relief under the bizarre conditions that had developed by mid\u20131943\".}} as opposed to the far more familiar case of localised shortage due to natural disaster. Moreover, the urban middle-class were their overriding concern, not the rural poor. They were also expecting the Government of India to rescue Bengal by bringing food in from outside the province (350,000 tons had been promised but not delivered). And finally, they had long stood by a public propaganda campaign declaring \"sufficiency\" in Bengal's rice supply, and were afraid that speaking of scarcity rather than sufficiency would lead to increased [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] and speculation.{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |p=127}}\n\nThere was also rampant corruption and nepotism in the distribution of government aid; often as much as half of the goods disappeared into the black market or into the hands of friends or relatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Brennan|1y=1988|1pp=555, 557 |2a1=Greenough |2y=1982 |2p=169|3a1= J.

Nevertheless, food distributed from government gruel kitchens immediately became the main source of aid for the rural poor.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nThe rails had been repaired in August and pressure from the Government of India brought substantial supplies into Calcutta during September,{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=136}} Linlithgow's final month as Viceroy. However, a second problem emerged: the Civil Supplies Department of Bengal was undermanned and under-equipped to distribute the supplies, and the resulting transportation bottleneck left very large piles of grain accumulating in the open air in several locations, including Calcutta's Botanical Garden.{{sfnm|1a1=Famine Inquiry Commission |1y=1945a |1pp=61\u201362|ps=, as cited in {{harvnb|Schneer|1947|p=176}} |2a1=Greenough |2y=1980|2p=214}} [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Archibald Wavell replaced Linlithgow that October, within two weeks he had requested military support for the transport and distribution of crucial supplies.

A key source of impoverishment was the widespread coping strategy of selling assets, including land.  In 1943 alone in one village in east Bengal, for example,  54 out of a total of 168 families sold all or part of their landholdings; among these, 39 (or very nearly 3 out of 4) did so as a coping strategy in reaction to the scarcity of food.{{sfn| \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2009|p=172}} As the famine wore on across Bengal, nearly 1.6 million families&nbsp;\u2013 roughly one-quarter of all landholders&nbsp;\u2013 sold or mortgaged their paddy lands in whole or in part. Some did so to profit from skyrocketing prices, but many others were trying to save themselves from crisis-driven distress.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The novel ''Ashani Sanket'' by [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]] is a fictional account of a young doctor and his wife in rural Bengal during the famine. It was adapted into a film of the same name (''[[Distant Thunder (1973 film)|Distant Thunder]]'') by director [[Satyajit Ray]] in 1973. The film is listed in ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made''.{{sfn|Best movies|2003}} Also well-known are the novel ''So Many Hungers!'' (1947) by [[Bhabani Bhattacharya]] and the 1980 film ''[[Akaler Shandhaney]]'' by [[Mrinal Sen]]. [[Ella Sen]]'s collection of stories based on reality, ''Darkening Days: Being a Narrative of Famine-Stricken Bengal'' recounts horrific events from a woman's point of view.{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=37}}\n\nA contemporary sketchbook of iconic scenes of famine victims, ''Hungry Bengal: a tour through Midnapur District in November, 1943'' by [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya|Chittaprosad]], was immediately banned by the British and 5,000 copies were seized and destroyed.{{sfn|J.

Attempting to determine culpability, research and analysis has covered complex issues such as the impacts of natural forces, market failures, failed policies or even malfeasance by governmental institutions, and war profiteering or other unscrupulous acts by private business. The questionable accuracy of much of the available contemporary statistical and anecdotal data is a complicating factor,{{sfn|Tauger |2009 |pp=173\u2013174}} as is the fact that the analyses and their conclusions are political and politicised.{{sfnm|1a1=Tauger |1y=2009 |1p=175 |2a1=Siegel|2y=2018|2p=43| 3a1=Devereux |3y=2000|3p=23 |4a1=Devereux|4y=2003|4p=256}}\n\nThe degree of crop shortfall in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has dominated the [[historiography]] of the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015 |p=12}}{{efn-ua|See for example {{harvtxt|A.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1977}} but the death blow was devastating leaps in the inflation rate due to heavy speculative buying and panic-driven hoarding.{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1976|1p= 1280|2a1=A. Sen |2y=1977|2p= 50 |3a1= A. Sen|3y=1981a|3p=76}} This in turn caused a fatal decline in the [[real wage]]s of landless agricultural workers,{{sfn|Aykroyd|1975|p=74}} transforming what should have been a local shortage into a horrific famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nMore recent analyses often stress political factors.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=21\u201323|ps=&nbsp;\"The conclusion is inescapable: famines are ''always'' political.\"}} Discussions of the government's role split into two broad camps: those which suggest that the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis,{{sfn|Brennan|Heathcote|Lucas|1984|p=18}} and those which assert that the government wilfully caused or ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and \"panicky responses\"{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2002b|p=102}} from a government that was spectacularly inept,{{sfnm|1a1=A.

He is smiling and making a \"V for victory\" gesture.|thumb |upright=0.9 |British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1943]]\n\nSen, for example, does not deny that British mis-government contributed to the crisis, but sees the policy failure as a complete misunderstanding of the cause of the famine. This misunderstanding led to a wholly misguided emphasis on measuring non-existent food shortages rather than addressing the very real and devastating inflation-driven imbalances in exchange entitlements.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|pp=52\u201353}} In stark contrast, though Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da notes that the exchange entitlements view of this famine is generally accepted,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=90|quote=The 1943\u201344 famine has become paradigmatic as an 'entitlements famine,' whereby speculation born of greed and panic produced an 'artificial' shortage of rice, the staple food.}} he lends greater weight to the importance of a crop shortfall than does Sen, and goes on to largely reject Sen's emphasis on hoarding and speculation.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1y=2008|1pp=25\u201328|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2015|2p=90}} He does not stop there, however, but emphasises a \"lack of political will\" and the pressure of wartime priorities that drove the British government and the provincial government of Bengal to make fateful decisions: the \"denial policies\", the use of heavy shipping for war supplies rather than food, the refusal to officially declare a state of famine, and the [[Balkanization|Balkanisation]] of grain markets through inter-provincial trade barriers.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |1y=2015|1p=90|1ps=&nbsp;\"...the lack of political will to divert foodstuffs from the war effort rather than [market] speculation... was mainly responsible for the famine\"|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008|2pp=20, 33}} On this view, these policies were designed to serve British military goals at the expense of Indian interests,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|pp=190\u2013191}} reflecting the War Cabinet's willingness to \"supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wavell|1y=1973|1pp= 68, 122|2a1=S.

Mukherjee |2015|pp=251\u2013252}} The policies may have met their intended wartime goals, but only at the cost of large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

As of November 2010, electromagnetic wave emissions are regulated under Monegasque legislation, itself inspired by the most stringent regulations in the industry, i.e., an electric-field intensity threshold of 6 Volts/metre for radio antenna, television, walkie-talkie, and WiFi emissions, and 4 Volts/metre for mobile-telephone relay antennas. Compliance with threshold values is monitored by the government-run DCE (Direction des Communications Electroniques) during annual measurement campaigns, or whenever new mobile radio frequency emitting equipment is brought into service.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.monaco-telecom.mc/}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Communications in Monaco]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1997]]\n", "name_user": "BOSS.mattia", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix. alphabetical order", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Telecom"}

These people influenced green thought in their advocacy of long-term [[Seven generation sustainability|seventh generation]] foresight, and on the personal responsibility of every individual to make moral choices.\n\nUnease about adverse consequences of human actions on nature predates the modern concept of [[environmentalism]].

They started as a provisional coalition of civic groups and political campaigns which, together, felt their interests were not expressed by the conventional parties.  After contesting the [[1979 European Parliament election in West Germany|1979 European elections]] they held a conference which identified Four Pillars of the Green Party which all groups in the original alliance could agree as the basis of a common Party platform: welding these groups together as a single Party. This statement of principles has since been utilised by many Green Parties around the world. It was this party that first coined the term \"Green\" (\"Gr\u00fcn\" in German) and adopted the [[sunflower]] symbol. The term \"Green\" was coined by one of the founders of the German Green Party, [[Petra Kelly]], after she visited Australia and saw the actions of the [[Builders Labourers Federation]] and their [[green ban]] actions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Humphries|first1=David|title=Newsmaker: Green bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/newsmaker-green-bans-20120330-1w372.html|agency=Sydney Morning Herald|date=31 March 2012}}</ref> In the [[1983 West German federal election|1983 federal election]], the Greens won 27 seats in the [[Bundestag]].\n\n==== Further developments ====\n[[File:Marina Silva em Xapuri 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marina Silva]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]]]]\n[[File:Cohn-Bendit at Paris 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Counterculture|contracultural]] leader of [[May 1968 events in France]]]]\nThe first Canadian foray into green politics took place in the Maritimes when 11 independent candidates (including one in Montreal and one in Toronto) ran in the 1980 federal election under the banner of the Small Party. Inspired by Schumacher's Small is Beautiful, the Small Party candidates ran for the expressed purpose of putting forward an anti-nuclear platform in that election. It was not registered as an official party, but some participants in that effort went on to form the [[Green Party of Canada]] in 1983 (the [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Greens]] and [[Green Party of British Columbia|British Columbia Greens]] were also formed that year). Current [[Green Party of Canada]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] was the instigator and one of the candidates of the Small Party and she was eventually elected as a member of the Green Party in [[2011 Canadian federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greenparty.ca/en/party/history|title=The Green Movement|publisher=Green Party of Canada|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Finland, the [[Green League]] became the first European Green Party to form part of a state-level Cabinet in 1995. The German Greens followed, forming a government with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (the \"[[Red-Green Alliance]]\") from 1998 to 2005. In 2001, they reached an agreement to end reliance on [[nuclear power]] in Germany, and agreed to remain in coalition and support the German government of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 Afghan War]]. This put them at odds with many Greens worldwide, but demonstrated that they were capable of difficult political tradeoffs.\n{{multiple image\n| total_width=500\n| align = right\n| image1 = Sergio Fajardo.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Claudia L\u00f3pez.png\n| image3 = Joschka Fischer 2014.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| image4 = Femke Halsema 2.jpg\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = \n| footer = [[Sergio Fajardo]], ex-mayor of [[Medell\u00edn]]; [[Claudia L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez]], mayor of [[Bogot\u00e1]]; [[Joschka Fischer]], ex [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] and [[Femke Halsema]], mayor of [[Amsterdam]]\n}}\nIn Latvia, [[Indulis Emsis]], leader of the Green Party and part of the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]], an alliance of a Nordic agrarian party and the Green Party, was [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] for ten months in 2004, making him the first [[Green party|Green]] politician to lead a country in the history of the world. In 2015, Emsis' party colleague, [[Raimonds V\u0113jonis]], was elected President of Latvia by the Latvian parliament. V\u0113jonis became the first green [[head of state]] worldwide.\n\nIn the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttenburg, the Green Party became the leader of the coalition with the Social Democrats after finishing second in the [[2011 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election]]. In the following [[2016 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election|state election, 2016]], the Green Party became the strongest party for the first time in a German [[Landtag]].\n\nIn 2016, the former leader of the Austrian [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Greens]] (1997 to 2008), [[Alexander Van der Bellen]], officially running as an independent, won the [[2016 Austrian presidential election]], making him the second green head of state worldwide and the first directly elected by popular vote. Van der Bellen placed second in the election's first round with 21.3% of the vote, the best result for the Austrian Greens in their history. He won the second round run-off against the far-right [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]]'s [[Norbert Hofer]] with 53.8% of the votes, making him the first President of Austria who was not backed by either the People's Party or the Social Democratic Party.\n\n== Core tenets ==\n[[File:4pilarsgreens.png|thumb|278x278px|The four green pillars]]\nAccording to [[Derek Wall]], a prominent British green proponent, there are four pillars that define green politics:<ref name=\"Wall\"/>\n* [[Ecology|Ecological wisdom]]\n* [[Social justice]]\n* [[Grassroots democracy]]\n* [[Nonviolence]]\n\nIn 1984, the Green Committees of Correspondence in the United States expanded the Four Pillars into Ten Key Values which further included:\n* [[Decentralization]]\n* [[Community-based economics]]\n* Post-patriarchal values (later translated to [[ecofeminism]] and [[Ethics of care]])\n* [[Respect for diversity]]\n* Global responsibility\n* Future focus\n\n[[File:6pilarsgreens.png|thumb|283x283px|The six guiding principles]]\nIn 2001, the [[Global Greens]] were organized as an international green movement. The [[Global Greens Charter]] identified six guiding principles:\n* Ecological wisdom\n* Social justice\n* [[Participatory democracy]]\n* Nonviolence\n* [[Sustainability]]\n* Respect for diversity\n\n=== Ecology ===\n=== Economics ===\n{{main|Communalism|Green economics|Participatory economics|Post-capitalism|Postgrowth|Common good (economics)}}\nGreen economics focuses on the importance of the health of the [[biosphere]] to [[Quality of life|human well-being]]. Consequently, most Greens distrust conventional capitalism, as it tends to emphasize [[economic growth]] while ignoring ecological health; the \"[[full cost accounting|full cost]]\" of economic growth often includes damage to the biosphere, which is unacceptable according to green politics. Green economics considers such growth to be \"[[uneconomic growth]]\"\u2014 material increase that nonetheless lowers overall quality of life. Green economics inherently takes a longer term perspective than conventional economics, because such loss in quality of life is often delayed. According to green economics, the present generation should not borrow from future generations, but rather attempt to achieve what [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] calls \"prosperity without growth\".\n[[File:Susan George (political scientist) - Kirchentag Cologne 2007.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Susan George (political scientist)]], theorist of [[social justice]] and [[international development]].]]\nSome Greens refer to [[productivism]], [[consumerism]] and [[scientism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as \"grey\", as contrasted with \"green\", economic views. \"Grey\" implies age, concrete, and lifelessness.\n\nTherefore, adherents to green politics advocate economic policies designed to safeguard the environment. Greens want governments to stop [[subsidy|subsidizing]] companies that waste resources or pollute the natural world, subsidies that Greens refer to as \"dirty subsidies\". Some currents of green politics place automobile and agribusiness subsidies in this category, as they may harm human health. On the contrary, Greens look to a [[green tax shift]] that are seen to encourage both producers and consumers to make ecologically friendly choices.\n\nMany aspects of green economics could be considered [[anti-globalization|anti-globalist]]. According to many left-wing greens, [[economic globalization]] is considered a threat to well-being, which will replace natural environments and local cultures with a single trade economy, termed the [[global economic monoculture]]. This is not a universal policy of greens, as [[green liberalism|green liberals]] and [[green conservatism|green conservatives]] support a regulated [[free market]] economy with additional measures to advance [[sustainable development]]\n\nSince green economics emphasizes biospheric health and [[biodiversity]], an issue outside the traditional left-right spectrum, different currents within green politics incorporate ideas from socialism and capitalism. Greens on the Left are often identified as [[Eco-socialism|Eco-socialists]], who merge ecology and environmentalism with socialism and [[Marxism]] and blame the capitalist system for environmental degradation, social injustice, inequality and conflict.  [[Eco-capitalism|Eco-capitalists]], on the other hand, believe that the [[free market]] system, with some modification, is capable of addressing ecological problems. This belief is documented in the business experiences of eco-capitalists in the book, ''The Gort Cloud'' that describes the [[gort cloud]] as the green community that supports eco-friendly businesses.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\n Tim Jackson, 2017 (cropped).jpg|[[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]], professor of [[sustainable development]] and [[Ecological economics]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and author of [[Prosperity Without Growth]]\n Fran\u00e7ois-Bausch--w.jpg|[[Fran\u00e7ois Bausch]], member of [[Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action|ATTAC]], theorist of the [[Tobin Tax]]\n El periodista brit\u00e1nico Paul Mason, fotografiado en Madrid (cropped).jpg|[[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], theorist of [[post-capitalism]] and [[Universal basic income]]\n Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|[[Serge Latouche]], theorist of [[degrowth]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Participatory democracy ===\n[[File:Saskia Sassen 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Saskia Sassen]], theorist of international [[Human migration]] and [[urban sociology]].]]\nSince the beginning, green politics has emphasized local, [[grassroots]]-level political activity and decision-making. According to its adherents, it is crucial that citizens play a direct role in the decisions that influence their lives and their environment. Therefore, green politics seeks to increase the role of [[deliberative democracy]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kronsell|first=Annica|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280314549_Environmental_politics_and_deliberative_democracy_Examining_the_promise_of_new_modes_of_governance|title=Environmental politics and deliberative democracy: Examining the promise of new modes of governance|last2=B\u00e4ckstrand|first2=Karin|last3=L\u00f6vbrand|last4=Khan|first4=Jamil|date=2010-06-30|isbn=978-1-84844-954-1}}</ref>, based on direct citizen involvement and [[consensus decision making]], wherever it is feasible.\n\nGreen politics also encourages political action on the individual level, such as [[ethical consumerism]], or buying things that are made according to environmentally ethical standards.  Indeed, many green parties emphasize individual and grassroots action at the local and regional levels over [[election|electoral politics]]. Historically, green parties have grown at the local level, gradually gaining influence and spreading to regional or provincial politics, only entering the national arena when there is a strong network of local support.\n\nIn addition, many greens believe that governments should not levy taxes against strictly local production and trade. Some Greens advocate new ways of organizing authority to increase local control, including [[urban secession]], [[bioregional democracy]], and co-operative/local stakeholder ownership.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\n NLN Michael Albert.jpg|[[Michael Albert]], theorist of [[participatory economics]] ([[participism]])\n Murray Bookchin in Burlington.jpg|[[Murray Bookchin]] developed the theory of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and [[post-scarcity economy]]\n C\u00e9sar Rendueles durante su conferencia en Wikiman\u00eda 2015 06.JPG|[[C\u00e9sar Rendueles]], theorist of [[Common good (economics)]] and [[open content]] and [[net neutrality]]\n AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|[[Antonio Negri]], theorist of [[Post-fordism]] and immaterial labour\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other issues ===\n[[File:Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at Meiji Shrine Outer Garden 03.JPG|thumb|Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at [[Meiji Shrine]] complex in Tokyo in which sixty thousand people marched chanting \"Sayonara nuclear power\" and waving banners to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-19/japan-anti-nuclear-protest/50461872/1 |title=Thousands march against nuclear power in Tokyo |date = September 2011|work=USA Today }}</ref><ref name=wompro>{{cite web |url=http://japanfocus.org/events/view/117#|title=Fukushima women against nuclear power: finding a voice from Tohoku |author=David H.

The goal is to rule by a [[consensus decision-making|consensus decision making]] process.\n\nStrong local coalitions are considered a prerequisite to higher-level electoral breakthroughs. Historically, the growth of Green parties has been sparked by a single issue where Greens can appeal to ordinary citizens' concerns.  In Germany, for example, the Greens' early opposition to nuclear power won them their first successes in the federal elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/history-behind-germanys-nuclear-phase-out|title=The history behind Germany's nuclear phase-out|date=2014-09-25|website=Clean Energy Wire|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Global organization ===\n[[File:Ashok Khosla, 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Ashok Khosla]] was president of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and also worked for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]]]\nThere is a growing level of global cooperation between Green parties. Global gatherings of Green Parties now happen. The first Planetary Meeting of Greens was held 30\u201331 May 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, immediately preceding the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] held there.  More than 200 Greens from 28 nations attended. The first formal Global Greens Gathering took place in [[Canberra]], in 2001, with more than 800 Greens from 72 countries in attendance.

Following the Planetary Meeting of Greens in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a Global Green Steering Committee was created, consisting of two seats for each continent. In 1993 this Global Steering Committee met in Mexico City and authorized the creation of a Global Green Network including a Global Green Calendar, Global Green Bulletin, and Global Green Directory. The Directory was issued in several editions in the next years. In 1996, 69 Green Parties from around the world signed a common declaration opposing French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, the first statement of global greens on a current issue. A second statement was issued in December 1997, concerning the Kyoto climate change treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/ggn/brief-history-2003|title=Global Greens Network - a brief history up to 2003|author=John Rensenbrink|publisher=Global Greens|date=August 2003}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2001 Canberra Global Gathering delegates for Green Parties from 72 countries decided upon a [[Global Greens Charter]] which proposes six key principles. Over time, each Green Party can discuss this and organize itself to approve it, some by using it in the local press, some by translating it for their web site, some by incorporating it into their manifesto, some by incorporating it into their constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Greens / Green Party of Canada Constitution|url=http://www.green.ca/english/members/constitution.shtml|website=green party of canada|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218004310/http://www.green.ca/english/members/constitution.shtml|archivedate=18 February 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> This process is taking place gradually, with online dialogue enabling parties to say where they are up to with this process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br/virtual.html |title=iG - Not\u00edcias, V\u00eddeos, Famosos, Esportes, Bate Papo, Infogr\u00e1ficos |publisher=Greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402095954/http://www.greenparties.hpg.ig.com.br/virtual.html |archivedate=2 April 2003 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Green bloc at the Copenhagen climate demo FYEG (4186296292).jpg|thumb|[[Federation of Young European Greens]] demonstration in [[Copenhagen]] during the Climate Summit 2009]]\nThe Gatherings also agree on organizational matters. The first Gathering voted unanimously to set up the ''Global Green Network'' (GGN). The GGN is composed of three representatives from each Green Party. A companion organization was set up by the same resolution: ''Global Green Coordination'' (GGC). This is composed of three representatives from each Federation (Africa, Europe, The Americas, Asia/Pacific, see below).  Discussion of the planned organization took place in several Green Parties prior to the Canberra meeting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Network of Green Parties|url=http://www.greens.org.au/bobbrown/global.htm|website=Australian Greens|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030301155622/http://www.greens.org.au/bobbrown/global.htm|archivedate=1 March 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref> The GGC communicates chiefly by email.  Any agreement by it has to be by unanimity of its members. It may identify possible global campaigns to propose to Green Parties worldwide. The GGC may endorse statements by individual Green Parties.  For example, it endorsed a statement by the US Green Party on the Israel-Palestine conflict.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of the Global Green Coordination on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|url=http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html|website=Green Party US|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030218053722/http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html|archivedate=18 February 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, Global Green Gatherings are an opportunity for informal networking, from which joint campaigning may arise. For example, a campaign to protect the [[New Caledonia]]n coral reef, by getting it nominated for World Heritage Status: a joint campaign by the New Caledonia Green Party, New Caledonian indigenous leaders, the [[French Green Party]], and the [[Australian Greens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/sites/globalgreens.org/files/spinifex-4.pdf|title=Spinifex '''4''', Newsletter of the 2001 Global Greens Congress|publisher=Consensus Productions|format=pdf}}</ref> Another example concerns [[Ingrid Betancourt]], the leader of the Green Party in [[Colombia]], the Green Oxygen Party (''[[Partido Verde Oxigeno]]''). Ingrid Betancourt and the party's Campaign Manager, Claire Rojas, were kidnapped by a hard-line faction of [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] on 7 March 2002, while travelling in FARC-controlled territory. Betancourt had spoken at the Canberra Gathering, making many friends. As a result, Green Parties all over the world have organized, pressing their governments to bring pressure to bear. For example, Green Parties in African countries, Austria, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, France, Scotland, Sweden and other countries have launched campaigns calling for Betancourt's release. [[Bob Brown]], the leader of the [[Australian Greens]], went to Colombia, as did an envoy from the European Federation, [[Alain Lipietz]], who issued a report.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alain LIPIETZ \u00e0 BOGOTA du 3 au 5 mars 2002|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz|website=Providence College: Tony Affigne: Green parties of the world declare: \"Free Ingrid Betancourt and Clara Rojas!\"|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040216090122/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz|archivedate=16 February 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> The four Federations of Green Parties issued a message to FARC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Parties of the World Call for Ingrid Betancout's Freedom|url=http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep|website=Green Parties world wide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120094936/http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep|archivedate=20 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ingrid Betancourt was rescued by the Colombian military in [[Operation Jaque]] in 2008.\n\n==== Global Green meetings ====\n[[File:Video Vandana Shiva 2014.webm|thumb|262x262px|[[Vandana Shiva]] in [[Cologne, Germany]], 2007]]\nSeparately from the Global Green Gatherings, ''Global Green Meetings'' take place. For instance, one took place on the fringe of the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg.  Green Parties attended from Australia, Taiwan, Korea, South Africa, Mauritius, Uganda, Cameroon, Republic of Cyprus, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway, the US, Mexico and Chile.\n\nThe Global Green Meeting discussed the situation of Green Parties on the African continent; heard a report from [[Mike Feinstein]], former Mayor of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], about setting up a web site of the GGN; discussed procedures for the better working of the GGC; and decided two topics on which the Global Greens could issue statements in the near future: Iraq and the 2003 WTO meeting in Cancun.\n\n=== Green federations ===\n[[File:Bob Brown at 2008 climate change rally DSC 6368.JPG|thumb|[[Bob Brown]] at a [[climate change]] rally in [[Melbourne]], 5 July 2008]]\nAffiliated members in Asia, Pacific and Oceania form the [[Asia-Pacific Green Network]].\nThe member parties of the [[Global Greens]] are organised into four continental federations:\n* [[Federation of Green Parties of Africa]]\n* [[Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas|Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas / Federaci\u00f3n de los Partidos Verdes de las Am\u00e9ricas]]\n* [[Asia-Pacific Green Network]]\n* [[European Green Party]]\n\nThe European Federation of Green Parties formed itself as the [[European Green Party]] on 22 February 2004, in the run-up to [[European Parliament]] elections in June 2004, a further step in trans-national integration.\n\n=== Green Political Parties  ===\nGreen movements are calling for social change to reduce the misuse of natural resources.

Some claim it also includes [[feminism]], [[pacifism]] and the [[animal rights]] movements. Some Greens support policy measures to [[gender empowerment|empower women]], especially mothers, [[great ape personhood]]; to [[anti-war movement|oppose war]], to de-escalate conflicts, and to stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict.\n\nSome Greens on the [[left-wing politics|Left]] adhere to [[eco-socialism]], an ideology that combines ecology, environmentalism, socialism, and [[Marxism]] to criticize the capitalist system as the cause of ecological crises, [[social exclusion]], [[social inequality|inequality]], and conflict. Green parties are not solely eco-socialist, but some Green parties around the world have or have had a significant eco-socialist membership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/green_party_future|title=The Future of the Green Party|last=Jan 28|first=2018|website=www.gp.org|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nDespite this stereotype, some [[radical centrism|centrist]] Greens may subscribe to a more [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[Georgism|Georgist]] or [[geolibertarianism|geolibertarian]] philosophy emphasizing individual [[right to property|property rights]] and [[free-market environmentalism]]{{spaced ndash}}and [[tax shift|shifting taxes]] away from value created by labor or service and charging instead for human consumption of the wealth created by the natural world (see ''[[land value tax]]'' and ''[[ecotax]]'').\n\nGreens may view the processes by which living beings compete for mates, homes, and food, ecology, and the cognitive and political sciences very differently. These differences tend to drive debate on ethics, formation of policy, and the public resolution of these differences in leadership races.

They started as a provisional coalition of civic groups and political campaigns which, together, felt their interests were not expressed by the conventional parties.  After contesting the [[1979 European Parliament election in West Germany|1979 European elections]] they held a conference which identified Four Pillars of the Green Party which all groups in the original alliance could agree as the basis of a common Party platform: welding these groups together as a single Party. This statement of principles has since been utilised by many Green Parties around the world. It was this party that first coined the term \"Green\" (\"Gr\u00fcn\" in German) and adopted the [[sunflower]] symbol. The term \"Green\" was coined by one of the founders of the German Green Party, [[Petra Kelly]], after she visited Australia and saw the actions of the [[Builders Labourers Federation]] and their [[green ban]] actions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Humphries|first1=David|title=Newsmaker: Green bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/newsmaker-green-bans-20120330-1w372.html|agency=Sydney Morning Herald|date=31 March 2012}}</ref> In the [[1983 West German federal election|1983 federal election]], the Greens won 27 seats in the [[Bundestag]].\n\n==== Further developments ====\n[[File:Marina Silva em Xapuri 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marina Silva]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]]]]\n[[File:Cohn-Bendit at Paris 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Counterculture|contracultural]] leader of [[May 1968 events in France]]]]\nThe first Canadian foray into green politics took place in the Maritimes when 11 independent candidates (including one in Montreal and one in Toronto) ran in the 1980 federal election under the banner of the Small Party. Inspired by Schumacher's Small is Beautiful, the Small Party candidates ran for the expressed purpose of putting forward an anti-nuclear platform in that election. It was not registered as an official party, but some participants in that effort went on to form the [[Green Party of Canada]] in 1983 (the [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Greens]] and [[Green Party of British Columbia|British Columbia Greens]] were also formed that year). Current [[Green Party of Canada]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] was the instigator and one of the candidates of the Small Party and she was eventually elected as a member of the Green Party in [[2011 Canadian federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greenparty.ca/en/party/history|title=The Green Movement|publisher=Green Party of Canada|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Finland, the [[Green League]] became the first European Green Party to form part of a state-level Cabinet in 1995. The German Greens followed, forming a government with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (the \"[[Red-Green Alliance]]\") from 1998 to 2005. In 2001, they reached an agreement to end reliance on [[nuclear power]] in Germany, and agreed to remain in coalition and support the German government of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 Afghan War]]. This put them at odds with many Greens worldwide, but demonstrated that they were capable of difficult political tradeoffs.\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Sergio Fajardo.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| image2 = Claudia Lopez Hernandez.jpg\n| width2=100\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Joschka Fischer 2014.jpg\n| width2 = 170\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Femke Halsema 2.jpg\n| width3 = 100\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = [[Sergio Fajardo]], ex-mayor of [[Medell\u00edn]];[[Claudia L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez]], mayor of [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Joschka Fischer]], ex [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] and [[Femke Halsema]], mayor of [[Amsterdam]]\n}}\nIn Latvia, [[Indulis Emsis]], leader of the Green Party and part of the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]], an alliance of a Nordic agrarian party and the Green Party, was [[Prime Minister of Latvia]] for ten months in 2004, making him the first [[Green party|Green]] politician to lead a country in the history of the world. In 2015, Emsis' party colleague, [[Raimonds V\u0113jonis]], was elected President of Latvia by the Latvian parliament. V\u0113jonis became the first green [[head of state]] worldwide.\n\nIn the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttenburg, the Green Party became the leader of the coalition with the Social Democrats after finishing second in the [[2011 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election]]. In the following [[2016 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election|state election, 2016]], the Green Party became the strongest party for the first time in a German [[Landtag]].\n\nIn 2016, the former leader of the Austrian [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Greens]] (1997 to 2008), [[Alexander Van der Bellen]], officially running as an independent, won the [[2016 Austrian presidential election]], making him the second green head of state worldwide and the first directly elected by popular vote. Van der Bellen placed second in the election's first round with 21.3% of the vote, the best result for the Austrian Greens in their history. He won the second round run-off against the far-right [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]]'s [[Norbert Hofer]] with 53.8% of the votes, making him the first President of Austria who was not backed by either the People's Party or the Social Democratic Party.\n\n== Core tenets ==\n[[File:4pilarsgreens.png|thumb|278x278px|The four green pillars]]\nAccording to [[Derek Wall]], a prominent British green proponent, there are four pillars that define green politics:<ref name=\"Wall\"/>\n* [[Ecology|Ecological wisdom]]\n* [[Social justice]]\n* [[Grassroots democracy]]\n* [[Nonviolence]]\n\nIn 1984, the Green Committees of Correspondence in the United States expanded the Four Pillars into Ten Key Values which further included:\n* [[Decentralization]]\n* [[Community-based economics]]\n* Post-patriarchal values (later translated to [[ecofeminism]] and [[Ethics of care]])\n* [[Respect for diversity]]\n* Global responsibility\n* Future focus\n\n[[File:6pilarsgreens.png|thumb|283x283px|The six guiding principles]]\nIn 2001, the [[Global Greens]] were organized as an international green movement. The [[Global Greens Charter]] identified six guiding principles:\n* Ecological wisdom\n* Social justice\n* [[Participatory democracy]]\n* Nonviolence\n* [[Sustainability]]\n* Respect for diversity\n\n=== Ecology ===\n=== Economics ===\n{{main|Communalism|Green economics|Participatory economics|Post-capitalism|Postgrowth|Common good (economics)}}\nGreen economics focuses on the importance of the health of the [[biosphere]] to [[Quality of life|human well-being]]. Consequently, most Greens distrust conventional capitalism, as it tends to emphasize [[economic growth]] while ignoring ecological health; the \"[[full cost accounting|full cost]]\" of economic growth often includes damage to the biosphere, which is unacceptable according to green politics. Green economics considers such growth to be \"[[uneconomic growth]]\"\u2014 material increase that nonetheless lowers overall quality of life. Green economics inherently takes a longer term perspective than conventional economics, because such loss in quality of life is often delayed. According to green economics, the present generation should not borrow from future generations, but rather attempt to achieve what [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] calls \"prosperity without growth\".\n[[File:Susan George (political scientist) - Kirchentag Cologne 2007.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Susan George (political scientist)]], theorist of [[social justice]] and [[international development]].]]\nSome Greens refer to [[productivism]], [[consumerism]] and [[scientism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as \"grey\", as contrasted with \"green\", economic views. \"Grey\" implies age, concrete, and lifelessness.\n\nTherefore, adherents to green politics advocate economic policies designed to safeguard the environment. Greens want governments to stop [[subsidy|subsidizing]] companies that waste resources or pollute the natural world, subsidies that Greens refer to as \"dirty subsidies\". Some currents of green politics place automobile and agribusiness subsidies in this category, as they may harm human health. On the contrary, Greens look to a [[green tax shift]] that are seen to encourage both producers and consumers to make ecologically friendly choices.\n\nMany aspects of green economics could be considered [[anti-globalization|anti-globalist]]. According to many left-wing greens, [[economic globalization]] is considered a threat to well-being, which will replace natural environments and local cultures with a single trade economy, termed the [[global economic monoculture]]. This is not a universal policy of greens, as [[green liberalism|green liberals]] and [[green conservatism|green conservatives]] support a regulated [[free market]] economy with additional measures to advance [[sustainable development]]\n\nSince green economics emphasizes biospheric health and [[biodiversity]], an issue outside the traditional left-right spectrum, different currents within green politics incorporate ideas from socialism and capitalism. Greens on the Left are often identified as [[Eco-socialism|Eco-socialists]], who merge ecology and environmentalism with socialism and [[Marxism]] and blame the capitalist system for environmental degradation, social injustice, inequality and conflict.  [[Eco-capitalism|Eco-capitalists]], on the other hand, believe that the [[free market]] system, with some modification, is capable of addressing ecological problems. This belief is documented in the business experiences of eco-capitalists in the book, ''The Gort Cloud'' that describes the [[gort cloud]] as the green community that supports eco-friendly businesses.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\n Tim Jackson, 2017 (cropped).jpg|[[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]], professor of [[sustainable development]] and [[Ecological economics]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and author of [[Prosperity Without Growth]]\n Fran\u00e7ois-Bausch--w.jpg|[[Fran\u00e7ois Bausch]], member of [[Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action|ATTAC]], theorist of the [[Tobin Tax]]\n El periodista brit\u00e1nico Paul Mason, fotografiado en Madrid (cropped).jpg|[[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], theorist of [[post-capitalism]] and [[Universal basic income]]\n Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|[[Serge Latouche]], theorist of [[degrowth]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Participatory democracy ===\n[[File:Saskia Sassen 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Saskia Sassen]], theorist of international [[Human migration]] and [[urban sociology]].]]\nSince the beginning, green politics has emphasized local, [[grassroots]]-level political activity and decision-making. According to its adherents, it is crucial that citizens play a direct role in the decisions that influence their lives and their environment. Therefore, green politics seeks to increase the role of [[deliberative democracy]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kronsell|first=Annica|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280314549_Environmental_politics_and_deliberative_democracy_Examining_the_promise_of_new_modes_of_governance|title=Environmental politics and deliberative democracy: Examining the promise of new modes of governance|last2=B\u00e4ckstrand|first2=Karin|last3=L\u00f6vbrand|last4=Khan|first4=Jamil|date=2010-06-30|isbn=978-1-84844-954-1}}</ref>, based on direct citizen involvement and [[consensus decision making]], wherever it is feasible.\n\nGreen politics also encourages political action on the individual level, such as [[ethical consumerism]], or buying things that are made according to environmentally ethical standards.  Indeed, many green parties emphasize individual and grassroots action at the local and regional levels over [[election|electoral politics]]. Historically, green parties have grown at the local level, gradually gaining influence and spreading to regional or provincial politics, only entering the national arena when there is a strong network of local support.\n\nIn addition, many greens believe that governments should not levy taxes against strictly local production and trade. Some Greens advocate new ways of organizing authority to increase local control, including [[urban secession]], [[bioregional democracy]], and co-operative/local stakeholder ownership.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\n NLN Michael Albert.jpg|[[Michael Albert]], theorist of [[participatory economics]] ([[participism]])\n Murray Bookchin in Burlington.jpg|[[Murray Bookchin]] developed the theory of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and [[post-scarcity economy]]\n C\u00e9sar Rendueles durante su conferencia en Wikiman\u00eda 2015 06.JPG|[[C\u00e9sar Rendueles]], theorist of [[Common good (economics)]] and [[open content]] and [[net neutrality]]\n AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|[[Antonio Negri]], theorist of [[Post-fordism]] and immaterial labour\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other issues ===\n[[File:Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at Meiji Shrine Outer Garden 03.JPG|thumb|Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at [[Meiji Shrine]] complex in Tokyo in which sixty thousand people marched chanting \"Sayonara nuclear power\" and waving banners to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-19/japan-anti-nuclear-protest/50461872/1 |title=Thousands march against nuclear power in Tokyo |date = September 2011|work=USA Today }}</ref><ref name=wompro>{{cite web |url=http://japanfocus.org/events/view/117#|title=Fukushima women against nuclear power: finding a voice from Tohoku |author=David H.

Following the Planetary Meeting of Greens in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a Global Green Steering Committee was created, consisting of two seats for each continent. In 1993 this Global Steering Committee met in Mexico City and authorized the creation of a Global Green Network including a Global Green Calendar, Global Green Bulletin, and Global Green Directory. The Directory was issued in several editions in the next years. In 1996, 69 Green Parties from around the world signed a common declaration opposing French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, the first statement of global greens on a current issue. A second statement was issued in December 1997, concerning the Kyoto climate change treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/ggn/brief-history-2003|title=Global Greens Network - a brief history up to 2003|author=John Rensenbrink|publisher=Global Greens|date=August 2003}}</ref>\n\nAt the 2001 Canberra Global Gathering delegates for Green Parties from 72 countries decided upon a [[Global Greens Charter]] which proposes six key principles.

For example, it endorsed a statement by the US Green Party on the Israel-Palestine conflict.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of the Global Green Coordination on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|url=http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html|website=Green Party US|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030218053722/http://www.greenpartyus.org/press/pr_04_10_02.html|archivedate=18 February 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, Global Green Gatherings are an opportunity for informal networking, from which joint campaigning may arise. For example, a campaign to protect the [[New Caledonia]]n coral reef, by getting it nominated for World Heritage Status: a joint campaign by the New Caledonia Green Party, New Caledonian indigenous leaders, the [[French Green Party]], and the [[Australian Greens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/sites/globalgreens.org/files/spinifex-4.pdf|title=Spinifex '''4''', Newsletter of the 2001 Global Greens Congress|publisher=Consensus Productions|format=pdf}}</ref> Another example concerns [[Ingrid Betancourt]], the leader of the Green Party in [[Colombia]], the Green Oxygen Party (''[[Partido Verde Oxigeno]]''). Ingrid Betancourt and the party's Campaign Manager, Claire Rojas, were kidnapped by a hard-line faction of [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] on 7 March 2002, while travelling in FARC-controlled territory. Betancourt had spoken at the Canberra Gathering, making many friends. As a result, Green Parties all over the world have organized, pressing their governments to bring pressure to bear. For example, Green Parties in African countries, Austria, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, France, Scotland, Sweden and other countries have launched campaigns calling for Betancourt's release. [[Bob Brown]], the leader of the [[Australian Greens]], went to Colombia, as did an envoy from the European Federation, [[Alain Lipietz]], who issued a report.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alain LIPIETZ \u00e0 BOGOTA du 3 au 5 mars 2002|url=http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz|website=Providence College: Tony Affigne: Green parties of the world declare: \"Free Ingrid Betancourt and Clara Rojas!\"|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040216090122/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/affigne/free_ingrid.htm#Anchor-Lipietz|archivedate=16 February 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> The four Federations of Green Parties issued a message to FARC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Parties of the World Call for Ingrid Betancout's Freedom|url=http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep|website=Green Parties world wide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120094936/http://www.web.greens.org/~cls/gp/to-farc-ep|archivedate=20 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ingrid Betancourt was rescued by the Colombian military in [[Operation Jaque]] in 2008.\n\n==== Global Green meetings ====\n[[File:Video Vandana Shiva 2014.webm|thumb|262x262px|[[Vandana Shiva]] in [[Cologne, Germany]], 2007]]\nSeparately from the Global Green Gatherings, ''Global Green Meetings'' take place. For instance, one took place on the fringe of the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in Johannesburg.  Green Parties attended from Australia, Taiwan, Korea, South Africa, Mauritius, Uganda, Cameroon, Republic of Cyprus, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway, the US, Mexico and Chile.\n\nThe Global Green Meeting discussed the situation of Green Parties on the African continent; heard a report from [[Mike Feinstein]], former Mayor of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], about setting up a web site of the GGN; discussed procedures for the better working of the GGC; and decided two topics on which the Global Greens could issue statements in the near future: Iraq and the 2003 WTO meeting in Cancun.\n\n=== Green federations ===\n[[File:Bob Brown at 2008 climate change rally DSC 6368.JPG|thumb|[[Bob Brown]] at a [[climate change]] rally in [[Melbourne]], 5 July 2008]]\nAffiliated members in Asia, Pacific and Oceania form the [[Asia-Pacific Green Network]].\nThe member parties of the [[Global Greens]] are organised into four continental federations:\n* [[Federation of Green Parties of Africa]]\n* [[Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas|Federation of the Green Parties of the Americas / Federaci\u00f3n de los Partidos Verdes de las Am\u00e9ricas]]\n* [[Asia-Pacific Green Network]]\n* [[European Green Party]]\n\nThe European Federation of Green Parties formed itself as the [[European Green Party]] on 22 February 2004, in the run-up to [[European Parliament]] elections in June 2004, a further step in trans-national integration.\n\n=== Green Political Parties  ===\nGreen movements are calling for social change to reduce the misuse of natural resources. These include grassroots non-governmental organizations like [[Greenpeace]] and green parties:\n* [[Australian Greens]]\n* [[The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative|Austrian Green Party]]\n* [[Green Party of England and Wales]]\n* [[Greens of Andorra]]\n* [[Belarusian Green Party]]\n* [[Groen (political party)|Groen]], [[Ecolo]]\n* [[LMP \u2013 Hungary's Green Party]]\n* [[Alliance 90/The Greens]]\n* [[Ecologist Greens]]\n* [[Red\u2013Green Alliance (Denmark)]]\n* [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)]]\n* [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)]]\n* [[Green Party (Israel)]]\n* [[Left-Green Movement]]\n* [[Federation of the Greens]]\n* [[Latvian Green Party]]\n* [[Democratic Renewal of Macedonia]]\n\n== Currents ==\n[[File:Wangari Maathai no Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Ecofeminism|Ecofeminist]] [[Wangari Maathai]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}Green politics is usually said to include the [[green anarchism]], [[eco-anarchism]], [[green libertarianism]], [[green liberalism]], [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] movements, and [[peace movement]]s, although these often claim not to be aligned with any party. Some claim it also includes [[feminism]], [[pacifism]] and the [[animal rights]] movements. Some Greens support policy measures to [[gender empowerment|empower women]], especially mothers, [[great ape personhood]]; to [[anti-war movement|oppose war]], to de-escalate conflicts, and to stop proliferating technologies useful in conflict or likely to lead to conflict.\n\nSome Greens on the [[left-wing politics|Left]] adhere to [[eco-socialism]], an ideology that combines ecology, environmentalism, socialism, and [[Marxism]] to criticize the capitalist system as the cause of ecological crises, [[social exclusion]], [[social inequality|inequality]], and conflict. Green parties are not solely eco-socialist, but some Green parties around the world have or have had a significant eco-socialist membership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/green_party_future|title=The Future of the Green Party|last=Jan 28|first=2018|website=www.gp.org|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nDespite this stereotype, some [[radical centrism|centrist]] Greens may subscribe to a more [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] [[Georgism|Georgist]] or [[geolibertarianism|geolibertarian]] philosophy emphasizing individual [[right to property|property rights]] and [[free-market environmentalism]]{{spaced ndash}}and [[tax shift|shifting taxes]] away from value created by labor or service and charging instead for human consumption of the wealth created by the natural world (see ''[[land value tax]]'' and ''[[ecotax]]'').\n\nGreens may view the processes by which living beings compete for mates, homes, and food, ecology, and the cognitive and political sciences very differently. These differences tend to drive debate on ethics, formation of policy, and the public resolution of these differences in leadership races. There is no single \"Green Ethic\".\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Earth sciences|Ecology|Environment}}\n<!-- Please add related topics to [[Outline of green politics]] -->\n* [[Outline of green politics]] (list of related articles, organized for easy browsing)\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=The No-Nonsense Guide to Green Politics|last=Wall|first=Derek|year=2010|publisher=New Internationalist Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-906523-39-8|ref=Wal10}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Dobson, Andrew (2007).
