Logo is not case-sensitive but retains the case used for formatting.\n\n==History==\nLogo was created in 1967 at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN), a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] research firm, by [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Cynthia Solomon]], and [[Seymour Papert]].<ref name=\"mit.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/index.html |title=Logo Foundation |website=el.media.mit.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122057/http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/index.html |archive-date=2011-07-21 |access-date=2011-04-07 }}</ref> Its intellectual roots are in [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[developmental psychology]]. The first four years of Logo research, development and teaching work was done at BBN. The first implementation of Logo, called Ghost, was written in [[LISP]] on a [[PDP-1]]. The goal was to create a mathematical land where children could play with words and sentences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://logothings.wikispaces.com/ |title=logothings |website=logothings.wikispaces.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207111525/http://logothings.wikispaces.com/ |archive-date=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Modeled on LISP, the design goals of Logo included accessible power{{Clarify |date=March 2008}} <!-- what kinda of power? --> and informative error messages. The use of virtual [[Turtle (robot)|Turtles]] allowed for immediate visual feedback and debugging of graphic programming.\n\nThe first working [[turtle (robot)|Logo turtle robot]] was created in 1969. A display turtle preceded the physical floor turtle. Modern Logo has not changed too much from the basic concepts before the first turtle. The first turtle was a tethered floor roamer, not [[radio-control]]led or [[wireless]]. At BBN Paul Wexelblat developed a turtle named Irving that had touch sensors and could move forwards, backwards, rotate, and ding its bell. The earliest year-long school users of Logo were in 1968\u201369 at Muzzey Jr High, [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington MA]]. The virtual and physical turtles were first used by fifth-graders at the Bridge School in Lexington, MA in 1970\u201371.\n\n==Turtle and graphics==\n{{see also|Turtle graphics}}\n\nLogo's most-known feature is the turtle (derived originally from a robot of the same name),<ref name=\"mit.edu\"/> an on-screen \"[[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)|cursor]]\" that showed output from commands for movement and small retractable pen, together producing line graphics. It has traditionally been displayed either as a triangle or a turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon). Turtle graphics were added to the Logo language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s to support Papert's version of the [[turtle (robot)|turtle robot]], a simple robot controlled from the user's workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set into or attached to the robot's body.\n\nAs a practical matter, the use of turtle geometry instead of a more traditional model mimics the actual movement logic of the turtle robot. The turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, ''LEFT 90'' means spin left by 90 degrees. Some Logo implementations, particularly those that allow the use of concurrency and multiple turtles, support [[collision detection]] and allow the user to redefine the appearance of the turtle cursor, essentially allowing the Logo turtles to function as [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].\n\nMultiple turtles are supported by [[MSWLogo]], as well as 3D graphics. Input from COM ports and LPT ports are also allowed by MSWLogo through windows GUI. Interrupts can be triggered via keyboard and mouse events. Simple [[GIF]] animations may also be produced on MSWLogo version 6.5 with the ''gifsave'' command.\n\nTurtle geometry is also sometimes used in environments other than Logo as an alternative to a strictly coordinate-addressed graphics system. For instance, the idea of turtle graphics is also useful in [[Lindenmayer system]] for generating [[fractal]]s.\n\n==Implementations==\n{{anchor|DrLogo}}<!--The page Dr. Logo redirects here-->\n{{see|UCBLogo}}\n{{Redirect|Apple Logo|the logo of Apple Inc.|Apple logo}}\n\n[[File:IBM LCSI Logo Welcome Screen.png|thumb|IBM LCSI Logo Welcome Screen]]\n[[File:IBM LCSI Logo Circles.png|thumb|Source code and output in IBM LCSI Logo running in DOSBox]]\nSome modern derivatives of Logo allow thousands of independently moving turtles. There are two popular implementations: [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[StarLogo]] and [[Northwestern University]] Center for Connected Learning's (CCL) [[NetLogo]]. They allow exploring [[emergence|emergent phenomena]] and come with many experiments in social studies, biology, physics, and other areas. NetLogo is widely used in agent-based simulation in the biological and social sciences.\n\nAlthough there is no one agreed-upon standard, there is a broad consensus on core aspects of the language. As of March 2020 there were 308 implementations and dialects of Logo, each with its own strengths.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pavel.it.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/logotree/pdf/LogoTree.pdf |title=The Logo Tree Project |website=elica.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306084150/http://elica.net/download/papers/LogoTreeProject.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-06 |access-date=2020-03-25 }}</ref> Most of those 308 are no longer in wide use, but many are still under active development.

Logo is not case-sensitive but retains the case used for formatting.\n\n==History==\nLogo was created in 1967 at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN), a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] research firm, by [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Cynthia Solomon]], and [[Seymour Papert]].<ref name=\"mit.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/index.html |title=Logo Foundation |website=el.media.mit.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122057/http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/index.html |archive-date=2011-07-21 |access-date=2011-04-07 }}</ref> Its intellectual roots are in [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[developmental psychology]]. The first four years of Logo research, development and teaching work was done at BBN. The first implementation of Logo, called Ghost, was written in [[LISP]] on a [[PDP-1]]. The goal was to create a mathematical land where children could play with words and sentences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://logothings.wikispaces.com/ |title=logothings |website=logothings.wikispaces.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207111525/http://logothings.wikispaces.com/ |archive-date=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Modeled on LISP, the design goals of Logo included accessible power{{Clarify |date=March 2008}} <!-- what kinda of power? --> and informative error messages. The use of virtual [[Turtle (robot)|Turtles]] allowed for immediate visual feedback and debugging of graphic programming.\n\nThe first working [[turtle (robot)|Logo turtle robot]] was created in 1969. A display turtle preceded the physical floor turtle. Modern Logo has not changed too much from the basic concepts before the first turtle. The first turtle was a tethered floor roamer, not [[radio-control]]led or [[wireless]]. At BBN Paul Wexelblat developed a turtle named Irving that had touch sensors and could move forwards, backwards, rotate, and ding its bell. The earliest year-long school users of Logo were in 1968-69 at Muzzey Jr High, [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington MA]]. The virtual and physical turtles were first used by fifth-graders at the Bridge School in Lexington, MA in 1970-71.\n\n==Turtle and graphics==\n{{see also|Turtle graphics}}\n\nLogo's most-known feature is the turtle (derived originally from a robot of the same name),<ref name=\"mit.edu\"/> an on-screen \"[[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)|cursor]]\" that showed output from commands for movement and small retractable pen, together producing line graphics. It has traditionally been displayed either as a triangle or a turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon). Turtle graphics were added to the Logo language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s to support Papert's version of the [[turtle (robot)|turtle robot]], a simple robot controlled from the user's workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set into or attached to the robot's body.\n\nAs a practical matter, the use of turtle geometry instead of a more traditional model mimics the actual movement logic of the turtle robot. The turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, ''LEFT 90'' means spin left by 90 degrees. Some Logo implementations, particularly those that allow the use of concurrency and multiple turtles, support [[collision detection]] and allow the user to redefine the appearance of the turtle cursor, essentially allowing the Logo turtles to function as [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].\n\nMultiple turtles are supported by [[MSWLogo]], as well as 3D graphics. Input from COM ports and LPT ports are also allowed by MSWLogo through windows GUI. Interrupts can be triggered via keyboard and mouse events. Simple [[GIF]] animations may also be produced on MSWLogo version 6.5 with the ''gifsave'' command.\n\nTurtle geometry is also sometimes used in environments other than Logo as an alternative to a strictly coordinate-addressed graphics system. For instance, the idea of turtle graphics is also useful in [[Lindenmayer system]] for generating [[fractal]]s.\n\n==Implementations==\n{{anchor|DrLogo}}<!--The page Dr. Logo redirects here-->\n{{see|UCBLogo}}\n{{Redirect|Apple Logo|the logo of Apple Inc.|Apple logo}}\n\n[[File:IBM LCSI Logo Welcome Screen.png|thumb|IBM LCSI Logo Welcome Screen]]\n[[File:IBM LCSI Logo Circles.png|thumb|Source code and output in IBM LCSI Logo running in DOSBox]]\nSome modern derivatives of Logo allow thousands of independently moving turtles. There are two popular implementations: [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[StarLogo]] and [[Northwestern University]] Center for Connected Learning's (CCL) [[NetLogo]]. They allow exploring [[emergence|emergent phenomena]] and come with many experiments in social studies, biology, physics, and other areas. NetLogo is widely used in agent-based simulation in the biological and social sciences.\n\nAlthough there is no one agreed-upon standard, there is a broad consensus on core aspects of the language. As of March 2020 there were 308 implementations and dialects of Logo, each with its own strengths.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pavel.it.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/logotree/pdf/LogoTree.pdf |title=The Logo Tree Project |website=elica.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306084150/http://elica.net/download/papers/LogoTreeProject.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-06 |access-date=2020-03-25 }}</ref> Most of those 308 are no longer in wide use, but many are still under active development.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission.

The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

Michael Dowd worked in the [[NYPD]]'s 75th Precinct in the [[East New York]] neighborhood of Brooklyn, which was considered to be one of the most dangerous precincts in the United States at the time. The 75th Precinct had one of the highest murder rates in the country during the late 1980s. Dowd describes being under-appreciated for the amount of work he put in and hurting for money as the reasons for taking money from drug dealers. He initially began taking bribes from drug dealers on the streets before moving on to protecting a drug cartel leader and robbing other drug dealers at gunpoint. Dowd and his then-partner Henry \"Chicky\" Guevara recount the first time walking into a domestic dispute in an apartment and seeing bags of marijuana, a [[duffle bag]] filled with approximately $20,000 in cash and two guns. Dowd communicated that he and his partner would take $8000 from the duffle bag and both guns. Dowd continued to rob drug dealers for thousands of dollars.  Guevara resigned shortly after multiple police officers were arrested in the 77th Precinct for corruption related offenses.\n\nKen Eurell, a police officer at the 75th Precinct, was then assigned as Dowd's new partner in June 1987. Eurell had a drinking problem and frequently drank on the job. Dowd and Eurell met a Dominican gang leader named Adam Diaz. Diaz ran The Diaz Organization, a gang that was responsible for countless murders and drug trafficking throughout New York City. He used several supermarkets in East New York as fronts to traffic drugs, mainly cocaine. Dowd and Eurell began a working relationship with Diaz, where they provided protection and inside information about raids.\n\nAfter a prolonged investigation, the [[Suffolk County Police Department]] arrested Dowd and Eurell on [[drug trafficking]] charges (in addition to their work for Diaz in the city, the men had begun distributing cocaine through a friend who lived in the county). Dowd and Eurell were released on bail. While out on bail, Dowd was approached by a friend in a Colombian gang who wanted a woman kidnapped over an unpaid drug debt. Dowd's plan was to hand the woman over to the gang and for him and Eurell to take the hundreds of thousands of dollars at the woman's house and flee the United States. Eurell agreed to Dowd's kidnapping scheme but instead of following through with the scheme contacted [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] through his lawyer. Shortly after, in July 1991, Dowd was arrested and sent to trial. He was the main focus of the 1992 Mollen Commission that investigated police corruption in the [[NYPD]].<ref name=\"dowd\">{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.themikedowd.com/what-we-do/|website=The Mike Dowd|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref> In the wake of Dowd's arrest, Mayor [[David Dinkins]] appointed the Mollen Commission to investigate police corruption within the [[NYPD]].

Migration to the region began in 1875 and continued throughout the late 19th century, driven by economic hardship in the region and a spirit of entrepreneurship and colonial expansion that was dominant during that time.  \n\nThe founder of San Luis is widely considered to be [[Clemente Giraldo]], a [[Presbyterian]] priest who sought to create a trading outpost between the cities of [[Granada (Antioquia)|Granada]] and the R\u00edo Magdalena. Upon arriving in the region from [[Granada, Antioquia|Granada]] with several families, Giraldo reached a large stone cliff, named \"el Castell\u00f3n\" in Spanish, on August 25, 1876, ow considered the official founding date of the municipality. Having found a defensible site in the mountains with plenty of forestry and available wood, Giraldo decided that this would be a very suitable site for the outpost. The settlers tested the fertility of the soil by planting banana trees, beans, [[sugar cane]], and [[yuca]] and, after a successful harvest, returned to Granada to deliver news regarding the new settlement.<ref>Descubrimiento, fundaci\u00f3n, historia del Departamento de Antioquia.

By 1878, the town had constructed its first church, a central park and was integrated as a segment of the municipality of [[San Carlos (Antioquia)|San Carlos]].\n\n== Effects of the Colombian conflict ==\nSince the 1960s, San Luis suffered a great deal during the [[Colombian Conflict]], especially between 1994 and 2004.

On December 12, 1999, 300 members of the [[FARC]] from the 9th and 47th fronts attacked the city's police station killing 9 policemen and wounding 4.

He was welcomed in a friendly fashion by the indigenous people known as the Taino. Trading with the natives yielded more gold than they had come across previously on the other Caribbean islands and Columbus was led to believe that much more gold would be found inland. Before he could explore further, his flagship, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'', ran aground and sank in the bay on December 24. With only two smaller ships remaining for the voyage home, Columbus built a fortified encampment, [[La Navidad]], on the shore and left behind 21 crewman to await his return the following year.<ref name=Morison>{{cite book |last1=Morison |first1=Samuel Eliot |title=The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages |date=1974 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nColonization began in earnest the following year when Columbus brought 1,300 men to Hispaniola in November 1493 with the intention of establishing a permanent settlement.

By 1501 Columbus's cousin, Giovanni Colombo, had discovered gold near Buenaventura. The deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along [[San Cristobal, Dominican Republic|San Cristobal]]-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]]-Cotuy-[[Bonao]] triangle, while [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|Concepci\u00f3n]], and Bonao became mining towns.

By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors (notably [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]) became regular stopping points for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Caribbean pirates]]. In 1606, the government of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than secure the island, his action meant that French, English, and Dutch pirates established their own bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island.\n\n[[File:Map of Hispaniola.JPG|thumb|300px|French map of Hispaniola by Nicolas de Fer]]\nIn 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by [[Louis XIV|King Louis&nbsp;XIV]].

Nicknamed the \"Pearl of the Antilles\", it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the [[West Indies]], with a system of human slavery used to grow and harvest sugar cane during a time when European demand for sugar was high. Slavery kept prices low and profit was maximized. It was an important port in the Americas for goods and products flowing to and from France and Europe.\n\nEuropean colonists often died young due to tropical fevers, as well as from violent slave resistance in the late eighteenth century. In 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], a major slave revolt broke out on Saint-Domingue.

They invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los Caballeros and Moca, killing most of their residents, but news of a French fleet sailing towards Haiti forced General Christophe to withdraw from the east, leaving it in French hands. \n\nIn 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the [[Criollo people|criollos]] of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of the United Kingdom, returned Santo Domingo to Spanish control. Fearing the influence of a society of slaves that had successfully revolted against their owners, the United States and European powers refused to recognize Haiti, the second republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo and de las Casas both recorded that the island was called ''Hait\u00ed'' (\"Mountainous Land\") by the Ta\u00edno.

He was welcomed in a friendly fashion by the indigenous people known as the Taino. Trading with the natives yielded more gold than they had come across previously on the other Caribbean islands and Columbus was led to believe that much more gold would be found inland. Before he could explore further, his flagship, the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]]'', ran aground and sank in the bay on December 24. With only two smaller ships remaining for the voyage home, Columbus built a fortified encampment, [[La Navidad]], on the shore and left behind 21 crewman to await his return the following year.<ref name=Morison>{{cite book |last1=Morison |first1=Samuel Eliot |title=The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages |date=1974 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nColonization began in earnest the following year when Columbus brought 1,300 men to Hispaniola in November 1493 with the intention of establishing a permanent settlement. They found the encampment at Navidad had been destroyed and all the crewmen left behind killed by the natives. Columbus decided to sail east in search of a better site to found a new settlement.
