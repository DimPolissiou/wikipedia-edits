Despite mixed reviews, ''Bad Boys'' was commercially successful and gained a cult following. It spawned the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' trilogy]], which includes two sequels, ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), and ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]'' (2020).\n\n==Plot==\nLifelong friends Marcus Burnett ([[Martin Lawrence]]) and Mike Lowrey ([[Will Smith]]) are Miami detectives investigating $100 million of seized Mafia heroin, which was stolen from a secure police vault. [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] suspects that it was an inside job and threatens to shut down the entire department unless they recover the drugs within five days.\n\nMike asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend Maxine \"Max\" Logan ([[Karen Alexander (fashion model)|Karen Alexander]]) to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. She gets herself and her best friend Julie Mott ([[T\u00e9a Leoni]]) hired as escorts by Eddie Dominguez (Emmanuel Xuereb), a former crooked cop. The party is soon interrupted by Dominguez's French drug kingpin boss Fouchet ([[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]]) and his henchmen Casper, Ferguson and Noah. Dominguez and Max are killed, while Julie manages to escape.\n\nFrantically calling the police station, Julie insists on talking only to Mike, who is away. Knowing she never met Mike, captain Conrad Howard ([[Joe Pantoliano]]) forces Marcus to impersonate Mike to talk to her. At her apartment, Marcus and Julie are attacked by one of Fouchet's henchmen, whom Marcus kills. When they rendezvous with Mike, Marcus and Mike have to impersonate each other, with Mike living at the Burnett residence while Marcus resides with Julie at Mike's apartment. The two struggle to keep it up in Julie's presence, and she quickly begins to suspect the truth.\n\nLooking through mugshots, Julie identifies Noah as one of the henchmen. The trio go to Club Hell, one of Noah's known hangouts. After being spotted, Marcus knocks Casper unconscious during a bathroom fight. Julie tries to kill Fouchet but Marcus stops her. In the ensuing car chase, Mike kills Noah. The three manage to get away, but are caught on camera by a news helicopter and the report is later seen by Marcus's family, who were told that Marcus was temporarily reassigned to Cleveland.\n\nMike and Marcus meet their old informant Jojo ([[Michael Imperioli]]) and learn about the location of the chemist who is cutting the stolen drugs. The three return to Mike's apartment, where Marcus's wife Theresa confronts them and confirms Julie's suspicion they have been impersonating each other. Fouchet's gang shows up and kidnaps Julie.\n\nMike and Marcus's department is shut down by Internal Affairs. Despite being reassigned, Howard delays the order, giving Mike and Marcus more time to solve the case. They access Dominguez's private police database profile and learn that the police secretary Francine is Dominguez's former girlfriend, who is being blackmailed by Fouchet after he obtained nude photos of her.\n\nMarcus, Mike and two other detectives, Sanchez, and Ruiz ([[Nestor Serrano]] and [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]]) head to the [[Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport]]. After a fierce shootout, they kill the remainder of Fouchet's henchmen, including Casper and Ferguson, and rescue Julie. They chase a fleeing Fouchet and force his car into a concrete barrier. As Fouchet tries to flee, Mike shoots Fouchet in the leg and arrests him at gunpoint. After a tense conversation with Marcus, Fouchet surreptitiously draws a gun but is shot to death by Mike before he can kill Marcus, avenging Max's death. An exhausted Marcus leaves Julie with Mike and heads home, eager to be reunited with his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Detective Sergeant Marcus Burnett\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Sergeant Michael Eugene \"Mike\" Lowrey\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Julie Mott\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Fouchet\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as Theresa Burnett\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Captain Conrad Howard\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Captain Alison Sinclair\n* [[Nestor Serrano]] as Detective Sanchez\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Detective Ruiz\n* Saverio Guerra as Chet\n* [[Anna Levine|Anna Thompson]] as Francine\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Elliot\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Jojo\n* Vic Manni as Ferguson\n* [[Frank John Hughes]] as Casper\n* Ralph Gonzales as Kuni\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Noah Trafficante\n* Emmanuel Xuereb as Eddie Dominguez\n* [[John Salley]] as Fletcher\n* [[Karen Alexander (fashion model)|Karen Alexander]] as Max Logan\n* [[Chris Mitchum]] as Sergeant Copperfield\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as store clerk\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Carjacker\n* [[Lisa Boyle]] as Girl Decoy\n* [[Ed Amatrudo]] as Ether van Boss\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 27, 1994, at the Dade Tire company near [[Greater Downtown Miami|downtown Miami]], the city chosen to replace the original New York locale. Filming continued throughout the area, including South Beach's Tides Hotel, the Mediterranean [[Miami Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]], the [[Miami-Dade County Courthouse|Dade County Courthouse]] and a multimillion-dollar estate on a private island. The second floor of downtown Miami's [[Alfred I. DuPont Building|Alfred DuPont building]] was converted into a police station; a freighter on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] into a drug lab. ''Bad Boys''' climactic scenes were filmed at the [[Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport|Opa-Locka Airport]]. Production wrapped on August 31. In the film's early stages of development, Simpson and Bruckheimer initially envisioned [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]] in the roles.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDD173EF932A05751C1A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=IN THE DRESSING ROOM WITH DANA CARVEY; Every Night Live? | first=Craig | last=Wolff | date=December 31, 1992 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref>  When the film was written for Carvey and Lovitz, the original title for ''Bad Boys'' was ''Bulletproof Hearts''. [[Arsenio Hall]] turned down the role of Lowrey and cites{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} that choice as the worst mistake he has ever made. The role eventually went to Smith. Both Lawrence and Smith were starring in their own hit TV shows, ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' and ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', when filming ''Bad Boys''. ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' even references the film in an episode. In the season 6, episode 20, called \"I Stank Horse\", Nicholas \"Nicky\" Banks tells Will that his parents will not let him watch ''Bad Boys'', to which Will replies, \"''Bad Boys'', huh? What'cha gonna do?\"\n\n===Improvisation===\nDirector Bay did not like the script and often engaged Smith and Lawrence in discussions about how the dialogue and scenes could improve. He often allowed them to improvise while the cameras were rolling. He secretly told Smith to call Lawrence a bitch before the car scene. The whole \"two bitches in the sea\" was improvised, as was Lawrence's comment when Leoni called him gay. The scene in the convenience store, wherein the clerk puts a gun to Burnett and Lowrey's heads and yells, telling them to \"Freeze, mother bitches!\", is also improvised. They came up with: \"No, ''you'' freeze, bitch! Now back up, put the gun down and get me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubbalicious\". \"And some Skittles.\" According to Bay in the DVD commentary, at the end of the film when Mike and Marcus are recuperating, Mike says \"I love you, man.\" Bay claims that Smith refused to say the line, causing the director and actor to argue back and forth over the line. Bay wanted Smith to say the line as he felt it summed up the friendship between the cops. After their argument had lasted for half of the day's shoot and much of the crew was ready to pack up, a fed up Bay told Smith to do whatever he wanted, after which Smith changed his mind and agreed to say the line.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was commercially successful, grossing $141,407,024 worldwide \u2014 $65,807,024 in North America and $75,600,000 overseas.<ref>{{cite web |title = Bad Boys (1995) |url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badboys.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate = August 12, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100730100826/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badboys.htm| archivedate=July 30, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nReview aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 43% of 63 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 5.06/10.

It is the fourth film to feature [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], and the second film in the series directed by [[Sam Mendes]] following ''[[Skyfall]].'' It was written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Jez Butterworth]]. It is the final ''James Bond'' film to be co-distributed by Columbia Pictures, as [[Universal Pictures]] will become the international distributor of its future films.\n\nThe story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] and their enigmatic leader [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] ([[Christoph Waltz]]), who plans to launch a national surveillance network to mastermind criminal activities across the globe. The film marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'';{{refn|name=SPECTRE reboot|group=N|Within the series' continuity, the version of [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] that appeared in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', making its appearance in ''Spectre'' its first in the new timeline.}} a character resembling Blofeld had previously appeared in the 1981 film, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', but, because of the [[Thunderball (novel)#Writing and copyright|''Thunderball'' controversy]], he is not named, nor is his face shown. Several [[List of recurring characters in the James Bond film series|''James Bond'' characters]], including [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]], return, with new additions [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Dr. Madeleine Swann, [[Dave Bautista]] as Mr. Hinx, [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Max Denbigh and [[Monica Bellucci]] as Lucia Sciarra.\n\n''Spectre'' was filmed from December 2014 to July 2015 in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies. ''Spectre'' was estimated to have cost around $245 million&mdash;with some sources listing it as high as $300 million&mdash;making it the most expensive Bond film and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''Spectre'' was released on 26 October 2015 in the United Kingdom\u201450 years after the release of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', 30 after ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', and 20 after ''[[GoldenEye]]''\u2014on the night of the world premiere at the London [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/spectre-world-premiere-at-the-royal-albert-hall-london/ | title= Ikon London Magazine Coverage from the world premiere of Spectre | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date=27 October 2015 | accessdate= 3 March 2018}}</ref> It was followed by a worldwide release, including [[IMAX]] screenings. It was released in the United States on 6 November. ''Spectre'' received mixed reviews from critics who praised the film's action sequences, cinematography, acting and musical score, though some criticism was aimed at the excessive runtime, screenplay and pacing. The theme song \"[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]\", performed and co-written by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song. ''Spectre'' grossed over $880 million worldwide, making it the [[2015 in film|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015]] and the second-largest [[Inflation|unadjusted]] total for the series after ''Skyfall''.\n\nThe next film in the series, ''[[No Time to Die]]'', is to be released in November 2020, with Craig reprising his role for the final time and [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]] directing.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- FILM PLOTS should be no more than 700 words, so please do not add to this summary unless you can keep the word count below that figure. -->\nA posthumous message from the previous [[M (James Bond)|M]] leads [[MI6]] agent James Bond to carry out an unauthorised mission in [[Mexico City]] on the [[Day of the Dead]], where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader, and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus.\n\nUpon his return to [[London]], Bond is suspended from field duty by [[Gareth Mallory]], the current M, who is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, [[private intelligence agency|privately backed]] Joint Intelligence Service formed by a recent merger of [[MI5]] and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"[[Five Eyes#Nine Eyes|Nine Eyes]]\", and uses his influence to close down the [[00 Agent|'00']] field agent section, which he believes is outdated.\n\nBond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He saves and seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Sciarra belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the \"Pale King\" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city in his [[Aston Martin DB10]] by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx, driving a [[Jaguar C-X75]]. [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]] informs Bond that the Pale King is [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], a former member of the organisation's subsidiary Quantum who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead roughly twenty years earlier.\n\nBond locates White in [[Altaussee]], Austria, where he is dying of [[thallium poisoning]]. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, psychiatrist Dr. Madeleine Swann, who will take him to L'Am\u00e9ricain in order to locate Oberhauser; White then commits suicide. Bond confronts Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces. The pair meet [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], who links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying [[Le Chiffre]], [[Dominic Greene (James Bond)|Dominic Greene]] and [[Raoul Silva]] as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].\n\nSwann takes Bond to L'Am\u00e9ricain, a hotel in [[Tangier]], and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the [[Sahara]]. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing fight, and are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has funded the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father, staged his own death, adopted the name [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and went on to form Spectre and target Bond. Bond and Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive wristwatch at his face, and the two escape to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.\n\nIn London, Bond and Swann meet M, [[Bill Tanner]], Q, and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C. Swann and Bond are abducted separately by Spectre operatives, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building]], scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Skyfall]]''.}} Blofeld, still alive, but now scarred over his right eye, tells Bond that he must escape before explosives are detonated in three minutes' time, or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto [[Westminster Bridge]]. As Blofeld crawls from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but rather than kill him, leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann. \n\nThe next morning, Bond borrows the repaired [[Aston Martin DB5]] from Q and drives away with Swann.\n\n=== Vehicles featured ===\n*[[Aston Martin DB10]]\n\n* [[Jaguar C-X75]]\n* [[Aston Martin DB5]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], agent 007.

It is the fourth film to feature [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], and the second film in the series directed by [[Sam Mendes]] following ''[[Skyfall]].'' It was written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Jez Butterworth]]. It is the final ''James Bond'' film to be co-distributed by Columbia Pictures, as [[Universal Pictures]] will become the international distributor of its future films.\n\nThe story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] and their enigmatic leader [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] ([[Christoph Waltz]]), who plans to launch a national surveillance network to mastermind criminal activities across the globe. The film marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'';{{refn|name=SPECTRE reboot|group=N|Within the series' continuity, the version of [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] that appeared in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', making its appearance in ''Spectre'' its first in the new timeline.}} a character resembling Blofeld had previously appeared in the 1981 film, ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', but, because of the [[Thunderball (novel)#Writing and copyright|''Thunderball'' controversy]], he is not named, nor is his face shown. Several [[List of recurring characters in the James Bond film series|''James Bond'' characters]], including [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]], return, with new additions [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Dr. Madeleine Swann, [[Dave Bautista]] as Mr. Hinx, [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Max Denbigh and [[Monica Bellucci]] as Lucia Sciarra.\n\n''Spectre'' was filmed from December 2014 to July 2015 in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies. ''Spectre'' was estimated to have cost around $245 million&mdash;with some sources listing it as high as $300 million&mdash;making it the most expensive Bond film and [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''Spectre'' was released on 26 October 2015 in the United Kingdom\u201450 years after the release of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', 30 after ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', and 20 after ''[[GoldenEye]]''\u2014on the night of the world premiere at the London [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/spectre-world-premiere-at-the-royal-albert-hall-london/ | title= Ikon London Magazine Coverage from the world premiere of Spectre | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date=27 October 2015 | accessdate= 3 March 2018}}</ref> It was followed by a worldwide release, including [[IMAX]] screenings. It was released in the United States on 6 November. ''Spectre'' received mixed reviews from critics who praised the film's action sequences, cinematography, acting and musical score, though some criticism was aimed at the excessive runtime, screenplay and pacing. The theme song \"[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]\", performed and co-written by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song. ''Spectre'' grossed over $880 million worldwide, making it the [[2015 in film|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015]] and the second-largest [[Inflation|unadjusted]] total for the series after ''Skyfall''.\n\nThe next film in the series, ''[[No Time to Die]]'', is to be released in November 2020, with Craig reprising his role for the final time and [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]] directing.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- FILM PLOTS should be no more than 700 words, so please do not add to this summary unless you can keep the word count below that figure. -->\nA posthumous message from the previous [[M (James Bond)|M]] leads [[MI6]] agent James Bond to carry out an unauthorised mission in [[Mexico City]] on the [[Day of the Dead]], where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader, and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus.\n\nUpon his return to [[London]], Bond is suspended from field duty by [[Gareth Mallory]], the current M, who is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, [[private intelligence agency|privately backed]] Joint Intelligence Service formed by a recent merger of [[MI5]] and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"[[Five Eyes#Nine Eyes|Nine Eyes]]\", and uses his influence to close down the [[00 Agent|'00']] field agent section, which he believes is outdated.\n\nBond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He saves and seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Sciarra belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the \"Pale King\" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city in his [[Aston Martin DB10]] by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx, driving a [[Jaguar C-X75]]. [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]] informs Bond that the Pale King is [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], a former member of the organisation's subsidiary Quantum who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead roughly twenty years earlier.\n\nBond locates White in [[Altaussee]], Austria, where he is dying of [[thallium poisoning]]. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, psychiatrist Dr. Madeleine Swann, who will take him to L'Am\u00e9ricain in order to locate Oberhauser; White then commits suicide. Bond confronts Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces. The pair meet [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], who links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying [[Le Chiffre]], [[Dominic Greene (James Bond)|Dominic Greene]] and [[Raoul Silva]] as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].\n\nSwann takes Bond to L'Am\u00e9ricain, a hotel in [[Tangier]], and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the [[Sahara]]. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing fight, and are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has funded the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father, staged his own death, adopted the name [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and went on to form Spectre and target Bond. Bond and Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive wristwatch at his face, and the two escape to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.\n\nIn London, Bond and Swann meet M, [[Bill Tanner]], Q, and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C. Swann and Bond are abducted separately by Spectre operatives, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building]], scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Skyfall]]''.}} Blofeld, still alive, but now scarred over his right eye, tells Bond that he must escape before explosives are detonated in three minutes' time, or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto [[Westminster Bridge]]. As Blofeld crawls from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but rather than kill him, leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann. \n\nThe next morning, Bond borrows the repaired [[Aston Martin DB5]] from Q and drives away with Swann.\n\n=== Vehicles featured ===\n*[[Aston Martin DB10]]\n\n* [[Jaguar C-X75]]\n* [[Aston Martin DB5]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], agent 007.
