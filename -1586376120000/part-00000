Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

These two were amalgamated into a single battalion and then amalgamated with [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]] to form a new five battalion regiment, called [[The Rifles]]. On its formation, the Light Division was abolished.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm The Rifles - March 2006 situation report 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515082627/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm |date=15 May 2006 }}</ref>\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role (2 RIFLES, 3 RIFLES) - 2\n*Mechanised Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Commando (1 RIFLES) - 1\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n\n* The single regular battalion of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] is unamalgamated to \"retain an infantry footprint in Northern Ireland\".\n**Air Assault/Light Role (1 R IRISH) - 1\n* The [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] is unaffected by the restructuring.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training.

This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

regiments, disbandings and amalgamations===\nFollowing the end of the [[Second World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey.

The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n# On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew aboard were lost at sea.\n# Returning from a mission along the East German/Czech border in the during the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968, an EA-3B was entering the landing pattern at Ramstein AFB when it had a slat malfunction pitching nose-up turn.<ref name=\"East\" />.  With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The piece is the first one in the [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Suite No. 2 from Romeo and Juliet, Op. 64ter|Suite No. 2 from ''Romeo and Juliet'', Op. 64ter]], which consists of two parts from his 1935 ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]''.

This theme is related to death and later served as the ''Introduction'' of Act III, after the fatal duel between Mercutio and Tybalt. It begins very loud, then drops to [[Dynamics (music)|''pianissimo'']], which is played by the strings. The [[French horn|horns]] and woodwinds then layer on top of the strings and the dynamics return to ''fortissimo''. It then drops to piano again.

The A section begins with a strong pulsating beat from the [[Brass instrument|brass]] section. This shows motoric rhythm, one of Prokofiev's signatures. The texture of this opening is almost metronomic, and provides a strong foundation for the dramatic string theme that comes out on top of it. Later on, the brass also takes up a soaring counter theme, and also punctuates the original string theme. In the ballet, this section would show the [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#House of Capulet|Capulets]] dancing in a very slow and dignified way, as this is the music for the Capulet Ball.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe B section provides a stark contrast, as it is in the ''pianissimo'' dynamic range and is played by the flutes. Together with the violas, they repeat a [[glissando]] throughout the section. It is marked [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|''adagio'']], and is very calm and serene. Prokofiev also utilizes touches of [[celesta]] in this section, which was highly unusual in orchestral works. In the middle of this section, there is an [[oboe]] solo accompanied by [[pizzicato]] strings. This section is meant to represent Juliet's entrance to the ball, as she flits about and meets various people.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} She eventually dances with the [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Count Paris|Count Paris]] until the close of this section.\n\nWhen the A section comes back, it is when Juliet has laid eyes on Romeo.

With songs by [[Cole Porter]], it stars [[Judy Garland]] and [[Gene Kelly]] with costars [[Walter Slezak]], [[Gladys Cooper]], [[Reginald Owen]], and [[George Zucco]].\n\n==Plot==\nManuela Alva ([[Judy Garland]]), who lives in the small Caribbean village of Calvados, dreams of being swept away by the legendary Pirate, Mack \"the Black\" Macoco. However, her aunt and uncle (who have raised her) insist that she marry the town mayor, the rotund and bullying Don Pedro ([[Walter Slezak]]).\n\nShortly before her wedding, Manuela visits a nearby town, Port Sebastian. A traveling circus has arrived, and Serafin ([[Gene Kelly]]), its handsome leader, flirts with all the girls in the song \"Ni\u00f1a\". When he encounters Manuela, however, he falls in love with her at first sight. He compliments her beauty and begs her not to marry Don Pedro, but, angered, she hurries away. That night, however, she can't sleep, and sneaks out to go see Serafin's show.\n\nAt the show, Serafin hypnotizes Manuela, thinking that she will admit that she loves him. Instead, she wildly sings and dances about her love for \"Mack the Black.\" Serafin awakens her with a kiss, and she flees in horror.\n\nOn Manuela's wedding day, the traveling players arrive in Calvados. Serafin begs her to join his troupe, and asks her to admit that she loves him. Don Pedro, hearing noise in her room, arrives at her door, and asks her to go away so that he can teach Serafin a lesson.\n\nSerafin recognizes Don Pedro as Macoco, retired and obese. He blackmails Macoco with this information, swearing to tell it to Manuela if Don Pedro forbids the performers from putting on a show. Serafin then decides to pretend to be Macoco in order to win over Manuela. He reveals himself before the whole town as Macoco, then asks Manuela if she will come with him; she again refuses. Still, watching from her window as he dances, she begins to daydream about him.  The next day, he threatens to burn down the town if he can't have her. Finally, she happily agrees to go with him.\n\nOne of Serafin's troupe accidentally reveals his plan to Manuela. To get her revenge, she first pretends to seduce him, then attacks him with words and hurtling objects. She accidentally knocks him out, then realizes that she loves him, and sings \"You Can Do No Wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Don Pedro convinces the viceroy that Serafin is the real Macoco and should hang for it. He plants treasure in Serafin's prop trunk to make him look like a pirate. The army arrests him, and Manuela's protests can't free him.  On the night of his hanging, Manuela finally gets to look at the false evidence, and recognizes a bracelet with the same design as the wedding ring that Don Pedro gave her, and realizes that he is the pirate.\n\nSerafin asks to do one last show before he is hanged, and sings and dances \"[[Be a Clown]]\" with two fellow troupe members (the [[Nicholas Brothers]]). As a finale, he plans to hypnotize Don Pedro into admitting he is Macoco, but Manuela's aunt uses her parasol to break the mirror that Serafin uses to hypnotize people. Panicked, Manuela pretends to be hypnotized and sings \"Love of My Life,\" vowing everlasting devotion to Macoco. Don Pedro, jealous, reveals himself as the true Macoco and seizes her. Serafin's troupe attacks him with all the items and juggling balls, and the lovers embrace. Manuela joins Serafin's act and the film ends with them singing a reprise of \"Be a Clown.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gene Kelly-Judy Garland in The Pirate trailer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Gene Kelly and Judy Garland]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Judy Garland]] as Manuela\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Serafin\n* [[Walter Slezak]] as Don Pedro Vargas, a.k.a.

N. Behrman]], which had starred [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]]. Opening at the Martin Beck Theatre on November 25, 1942, ''The Pirate'' played for 176 performances before the screen rights were purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for $225,000.  While the Lunts themselves expressed interest in bringing the story to the screen, MGM envisioned the property as a comedy for [[William Powell]] and either [[Myrna Loy]] or [[Hedy Lamarr]].  Over the next two years, more than a half-dozen scenarists, producers, and directors worked on ideas for developing the property.\n\nIt was the play's original scenic designer, [[Lemuel Ayers]], who suggested to MGM's preeminent musical producer [[Arthur Freed]] that ''The Pirate'' would make an effective musical.  Freed presented the idea to [[Judy Garland]], his top musical star, and her husband, director [[Vincente Minnelli]].  Garland was then at the top of her box-office stature in Hollywood, and Minnelli was the logical choice as director, as he had successfully helmed most of her recent movies (''[[Meet Me In St. Louis]]'', ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', and ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]'').  Garland was eager to demonstrate her talents as a sophisticated leading comedienne in the same class as [[Katharine Hepburn]], and MGM saw a perfect opportunity to reunite her with [[Gene Kelly]], newly returned from his navy service in World War II and an [[Academy Award]] nominee for Best Actor for ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]''.  Freed engaged legendary composer [[Cole Porter]] to write the score for a $100,000 fee, and entrusted [[Anita Loos]] and [[Joseph Than]] with the film's scenario.  They fashioned a role for [[Lena Horne]], that of Conchita, a local dressmaker and Garland's confidante.  After five months of work, Loos and Than offered a reading of their script to Freed, Minnelli, Garland, Kelly, and Porter.  To the horror of the listeners, the team had produced an awkward, unusable reversal of Behrman's original premise.  Although the female lead remained an impressionable Caribbean girl besotted by dreams of a legendary pirate, the leading man was no longer a touring actor impersonating her daring seaman, but a dancing pirate who pretended to be an entertainer.  Producer Freed immediately replaced Loos and Than with the great husband and wife team of [[Albert Hackett]] and [[Frances Goodrich]].  In two months, they turned in a witty and workable adaptation of the Behrman original, geared to Porter's songs.  The role for Horne was dropped from their script.\n\nBy October 1946, Cole Porter had turned in eight songs and departed for New York.  One of these, \"[It's Chic In] Martinique\" was dropped when Horne's role was eliminated, but seven other Porter numbers were slotted in the new script.  The choreographer, conductor, orchestrator, and vocal arranger comprised a solid crew from the Freed Unit at MGM:  [[Robert Alton]], [[Lennie Hayton]], [[Conrad Salinger]], and [[Kay Thompson]].  Garland began prerecording the score at the studio on December 27, 1946.\n\n[[Madame Barbara Karinska]], the famous costumiere, was engaged to execute the costume designs of [[Tom Keogh]].  \"One of Judy's eight costume designs,\" said Keogh, \"was a replica of an 1830 Worth gown.  It cost $3,462.23 to make.  Another was a white satin wedding dress, with handmade antique lace from France and embroidered with a thousand pearls; it cost $3,313.12.  Each of the girl's costumes had five petticoats and all the embroidery was done by hand.  The total wardrobe cost was $141,595.30.\"\n\nLeading man [[Gene Kelly]] approached his role with enthusiasm.  His inspirations for the character of Serafin were his boyhood cinema heroes: the swashbuckling athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks and the hammy flamboyance of John Barrymore.  He was also eager to express his characterization through dance on film, using ballet more than he previously had.  \"I wanted the opportunity to do a different kind of dancing,\" said Kelly, \"a popular style with a lot of classic form, acrobatics and athletics.\"  An aspiring film director, Kelly also worked closely with Minnelli to learn the technical end of filmmaking behind the camera.\n\nEveryone involved in the film's production possessed exemplary credentials:  [[Walter Slezak]] and [[Gladys Cooper]] were cast, respectively, as Don Pedro and Manuela's Aunt Inez; supporting roles were filled with veteran players [[Reginald Owen]], [[George Zucco]], [[Ben Lessy]], and the astounding [[Nicholas Brothers]].  Behind the scenes were cameraman [[Harry Stradling]] and art director [[Jack Martin Smith]].\n\nPrincipal photography on ''The Pirate'' began on February 17, 1947.  Almost immediately, the film was beset by problems.  Unhappy with Kay Thompson's arrangement of the opening number, \"Mack The Black\", Freed ordered the song re-recorded and re-shot.  Garland termed Thompson's treatment of the song, \"insanity\", and Cole Porter diplomatically offered that the number \"has me in a dither.\"  Minnelli wanted to expand Kelly's role, and new scenes had to be written and re-shuffled.  Elaborate sets were built to Minnelli's exacting instructions.  For Kelly's number ''Nina'', a plaza in the town of Calvados was built on a soundstage at MGM, with a pavilion in the middle and the streets unevenly paved with cobblestones for realistic effect.  The cost was $86,660.00\n\nParamount among the problems plaguing the shooting schedule was [[Judy Garland]]'s increasing inability to perform.  Years of overwork at MGM, postpartum depression after the birth of her daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] nine months earlier, and a heavy reliance on prescription medication finally caught up with the twenty-five year old star, and she often failed to show up on time for work, if at all.  According to her biographer John Fricke, Garland was also unhappy with the way ''The Pirate'' was shaping up.  Despite her initial enthusiasm to play a character outside her usual winsome all-American roles, Garland \"began to feel adrift in the imaginative self-indulgence that suddenly surrounded her on the set of ''The Pirate''.  Her instincts told her that Minnelli, Kelly, and [Kay] Thompson were unwittingly producing a motion picture for themselves- and for an audience that might not exist.\"  Her marriage to Minnelli began to unravel during the shoot, and her consumption of prescription stimulants and sedatives increased.  After suffering a panicked breakdown on the set during the filming of one musical number, Garland was hospitalized for a couple of weeks.  The crew and her co-workers were sympathetic to the young woman's travails, testifying that she was not a temperamental star but a talented artist struggling with health issues.  Out of 135 days of rehearsals and shooting, Garland was absent for 99.\n\nSeveral songs were cut, and others moved around. Garland and Kelly were to perform a tempestuous dance to \"Voodoo\". The sequence was filmed, but MGM executives felt its choreography was too openly sexual for audiences to accept, and they ordered the number removed. When MGM chieftain [[Louis B. Mayer]] saw the footage he was so outraged he ordered the negatives to be burned.  \"If that exhibition gets on the screen\", he shouted, \"we'll be raided by the police!\" No known footage of the number is known to exist today.  Mayer also protested the erotic flavor of Kelly's \"The Pirate Ballet\".  Garland's rendition of \"Love of My Life\" was excised, leaving only her reprise of the number near the end of the film.  Her show-stopping performance of \"Mack The Black\" was restaged in a more straight-forward musical comedy style.  The dancing [[Nicholas Brothers]] joined Kelly for the incredible first version of \"Be A Clown\", but theater owners in the South removed the number from their prints because white audiences wouldn't watch two African-American dancers performing with a white dancer as equals.    \n\nThe score was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]], losing out to another MGM musical, ''[[Easter Parade (1948 film)|Easter Parade]]'', also starring Garland and produced by [[Arthur Freed]].\n\nThe film was shot in Technicolor.\n\n==Reception==\nOn June 11, 1948, the picture finally went into release, costing $3,768,496.  It went over its budget by $553,888.\n\nAudiences failed to respond to the film's high-brow ambitions, and while many critics hailed its sophistication, box office results failed to follow suit.  The British author [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]], in his book ''The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years'', described it as being overall \"a neat moneymaker, but otherwise probably the least successful of Garland's MGM films.\"<ref>David Shipman ''The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years'', London: Macdonald, 1989, p. 249</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' offered, \"The Pirate, which came yesterday to the Radio City Music Hall, is a dazzling, spectacular extravaganza, shot through with all the colors of the rainbow and then some that Technicolor patented.  It takes this mammoth show some time to generate a full head of steam, but when it gets rolling it's thoroughly delightful.\"\n\n''[[The New York Herald Tribune]]'' wrote, \"At the Music Hall there is more dancing than script; more production pomp than sensible staging.  But with Gene Kelly hoofing like a dervish, Judy Garland changing character at the drop of a hat, and resplendent trappings, the show is bouncing and beautiful.\"\n\n''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' thought, \"Certainly no effort was spared; the cast is star-studded, and the settings and costumes are strikingly handsome.

With songs by [[Cole Porter]], it stars [[Judy Garland]] and [[Gene Kelly]] with costars [[Walter Slezak]], [[Gladys Cooper]], [[Reginald Owen]], and [[George Zucco]].\n\n==Plot==\nManuela Alva ([[Judy Garland]]), who lives in the small Caribbean village of Calvados, dreams of being swept away by the legendary Pirate, Mack \"the Black\" Macoco. However, her aunt and uncle (who have raised her) insist that she marry the town mayor, the rotund and bullying Don Pedro ([[Walter Slezak]]).\n\nShortly before her wedding, Manuela visits a nearby town, Port Sebastian. A traveling circus has arrived, and Serafin ([[Gene Kelly]]), its handsome leader, flirts with all the girls in the song \"Ni\u00f1a\". When he encounters Manuela, however, he falls in love with her at first sight. He compliments her beauty and begs her not to marry Don Pedro, but, angered, she hurries away. That night, however, she can't sleep, and sneaks out to go see Serafin's show.\n\nAt the show, Serafin hypnotizes Manuela, thinking that she will admit that she loves him. Instead, she wildly sings and dances about her love for \"Mack the Black.\" Serafin awakens her with a kiss, and she flees in horror.\n\nOn Manuela's wedding day, the traveling players arrive in Calvados. Serafin begs her to join his troupe, and asks her to admit that she loves him. Don Pedro, hearing noise in her room, arrives at her door, and asks her to go away so that he can teach Serafin a lesson.\n\nSerafin recognizes Don Pedro as Macoco, retired and obese. He blackmails Macoco with this information, swearing to tell it to Manuela if Don Pedro forbids the performers from putting on a show. Serafin then decides to pretend to be Macoco in order to win over Manuela. He reveals himself before the whole town as Macoco, then asks Manuela if she will come with him; she again refuses. Still, watching from her window as he dances, she begins to daydream about him.  The next day, he threatens to burn down the town if he can't have her. Finally, she happily agrees to go with him.\n\nOne of Serafin's troupe accidentally reveals his plan to Manuela. To get her revenge, she first pretends to seduce him, then attacks him with words and hurtling objects. She accidentally knocks him out, then realizes that she loves him, and sings \"You Can Do No Wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Don Pedro convinces the viceroy that Serafin is the real Macoco and should hang for it. He plants treasure in Serafin's prop trunk to make him look like a pirate. The army arrests him, and Manuela's protests can't free him.  On the night of his hanging, Manuela finally gets to look at the false evidence, and recognizes a bracelet with the same design as the wedding ring that Don Pedro gave her, and realizes that he is the pirate.\n\nSerafin asks to do one last show before he is hanged, and sings and dances \"[[Be a Clown]]\" with two fellow troupe members (the [[Nicholas Brothers]]). As a finale, he plans to hypnotize Don Pedro into admitting he is Macoco, but Manuela's aunt uses her parasol to break the mirror that Serafin uses to hypnotize people. Panicked, Manuela pretends to be hypnotized and sings \"Love of My Life,\" vowing everlasting devotion to Macoco. Don Pedro, jealous, reveals himself as the true Macoco and seizes her. Serafin's troupe attacks him with all the items and juggling balls, and the lovers embrace. Manuela joins Serafin's act and the film ends with them singing a reprise of \"Be a Clown.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gene Kelly-Judy Garland in The Pirate trailer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Gene Kelly and Judy Garland]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Judy Garland]] as Manuela\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Serafin\n* [[Walter Slezak]] as Don Pedro Vargas, a.k.a.

N. Behrman]], which had starred [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]]. Opening at the Martin Beck Theatre on November 25, 1942, ''[[The Pirate]]'' played for 176 performances before the screen rights were purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for $225,000.  While the Lunts themselves expressed interest in bringing the story to the screen, MGM envisioned the property as a comedy for [[William Powell]] and either [[Myrna Loy]] or [[Hedy Lamarr]].  Over the next two years, more than a half-dozen scenarists, producers, and directors worked on ideas for developing the property.\n\nIt was the play's original scenic designer, [[Lemuel Ayers]], who suggested to MGM's preeminent musical producer [[Arthur Freed]] that ''The Pirate'' would make an effective musical.  Freed presented the idea to [[Judy Garland]], his top musical star, and her husband, director [[Vincente Minnelli]].  Garland was then at the top of her box-office stature in Hollywood, and Minnelli was the logical choice as director, as he had successfully helmed most of her recent movies (''[[Meet Me In St. Louis]]'', ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', and ''[[The Clock]]'').  Garland was eager to demonstrate her talents as a sophisticated leading comedienne in the same class as [[Katharine Hepburn]], and MGM saw a perfect opportunity to reunite her with [[Gene Kelly]], newly returned from his navy service in World War II and an [[Academy Award]] nominee for Best Actor for ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]''.  Freed engaged legendary composer [[Cole Porter]] to write the score for a $100,000 fee, and entrusted [[Anita Loos]] and [[Joseph Than]] with the film's scenario.  They fashioned a role for [[Lena Horne]], that of Conchita, a local dressmaker and Garland's confidante.  After five months of work, Loos and Than offered a reading of their script to Freed, Minnelli, Garland, Kelly, and Porter.  To the horror of the listeners, the team had produced an awkward, unusable reversal of Behrman's original premise.  Although the female lead remained an impressionable Caribbean girl besotted by dreams of a legendary pirate, the leading man was no longer a touring actor impersonating her daring seaman, but a dancing pirate who pretended to be an entertainer.  Producer Freed immediately replaced Loos and Than with the great husband and wife team of [[Albert Hackett]] and [[Frances Goodrich]].  In two months, they turned in a witty and workable adaptation of the Behrman original, geared to Porter's songs.  The role for Horne was dropped from their script.\n\nBy October 1946, Cole Porter had turned in eight songs and departed for New York.  One of these, \"[It's Chic In] Martinique\" was dropped when Horne's role was eliminated, but seven other Porter numbers were slotted in the new script.  The choreographer, conductor, orchestrator, and vocal arranger comprised a solid crew from the Freed Unit at MGM:  [[Robert Alton]], [[Lennie Hayton]], [[Conrad Salinger]], and [[Kay Thompson]].  Garland began prerecording the score at the studio on December 27, 1946.\n\n[[Madame Barbara Karinska]], the famous costumiere, was engaged to execute the costume designs of [[Tom Keogh]].  \"One of Judy's eight costume designs,\" said Keogh, \"was a replica of an 1830 Worth gown.  It cost $3,462.23 to make.  Another was a white satin wedding dress, with handmade antique lace from France and embroidered with a thousand pearls; it cost $3,313.12.  Each of the girl's costumes had five petticoats and all the embroidery was done by hand.  The total wardrobe cost was $141,595.30.\"\n\nLeading man [[Gene Kelly]] approached his role with enthusiasm.  His inspirations for the character of Serafin were his boyhood cinema heroes: the swashbuckling athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks and the hammy flamboyance of John Barrymore.  He was also eager to express his characterization through dance on film, using ballet more than he previously had.  \"I wanted the opportunity to do a different kind of dancing,\" said Kelly, \"a popular style with a lot of classic form, acrobatics and athletics.\"  An aspiring film director, Kelly also worked closely with Minnelli to learn the technical end of filmmaking behind the camera.\n\nEveryone involved in the film's production possessed exemplary credentials:  [[Walter Slezak]] and [[Gladys Cooper]] were cast, respectively, as Don Pedro and Manuela's Aunt Inez; supporting roles were filled with veteran players [[Reginald Owen]], [[George Zucco]], [[Ben Lessy]], and the astounding [[Nicholas Brothers]].  Behind the scenes were cameraman [[Harry Stradling]] and art director [[Jack Martin Smith]].\n\nPrincipal photography on ''[[The Pirate]]'' began on February 17, 1947.  Almost immediately, the film was beset by problems.  Unhappy with Kay Thompson's arrangement of the opening number, \"Mack The Black\", Freed ordered the song re-recorded and re-shot.  Garland termed Thompson's treatment of the song, \"insanity\", and Cole Porter diplomatically offered that the number \"has me in a dither.\"  Minnelli wanted to expand Kelly's role, and new scenes had to be written and re-shuffled.  Elaborate sets were built to Minnelli's exacting instructions.  For Kelly's number ''Nina'', a plaza in the town of Calvados was built on a soundstage at MGM, with a pavilion in the middle and the streets unevenly paved with cobblestones for realistic effect.  The cost was $86,660.00\n\nParamount among the problems plaguing the shooting schedule was [[Judy Garland]]'s increasing inability to perform.  Years of overwork at MGM, postpartum depression after the birth of her daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] nine months earlier, and a heavy reliance on prescription medication finally caught up with the twenty-five year old star, and she often failed to show up on time for work, if at all.  According to her biographer John Fricke, Garland was also unhappy with the way ''[[The Pirate]]'' was shaping up.  Despite her initial enthusiasm to play a character outside her usual winsome all-American roles, Garland \"began to feel adrift in the imaginative self-indulgence that suddenly surrounded her on the set of ''The Pirate''.  Her instincts told her that Minnelli, Kelly, and [Kay] Thompson were unwittingly producing a motion picture for themselves- and for an audience that might not exist.\"  Her marriage to Minnelli began to unravel during the shoot, and her consumption of prescription stimulants and sedatives increased.  After suffering a panicked breakdown on the set during the filming of one musical number, Garland was hospitalized for a couple of weeks.  The crew and her co-workers were sympathetic to the young woman's travails, testifying that she was not a temperamental star but a talented artist struggling with health issues.  Out of 135 days of rehearsals and shooting, Garland was absent for 99.\n\nSeveral songs were cut, and others moved around. Garland and Kelly were to perform a tempestuous dance to \"Voodoo\". The sequence was filmed, but MGM executives felt its choreography was too openly sexual for audiences to accept, and they ordered the number removed. When MGM chieftain [[Louis B. Mayer]] saw the footage he was so outraged he ordered the negatives to be burned.  \"If that exhibition gets on the screen\", he shouted, \"we'll be raided by the police!\" No known footage of the number is known to exist today.  Mayer also protested the erotic flavor of Kelly's \"The Pirate Ballet\".  Garland's rendition of \"Love of My Life\" was excised, leaving only her reprise of the number near the end of the film.  Her show-stopping performance of \"Mack The Black\" was restaged in a more straight-forward musical comedy style.  The dancing [[Nicholas Brothers]] joined Kelly for the incredible first version of \"Be A Clown\", but theater owners in the South removed the number from their prints because white audiences wouldn't watch two African-American dancers performing with a white dancer as equals.    \n\nThe score was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]], losing out to another MGM musical, ''[[Easter Parade (1948 film)|Easter Parade]]'', also starring Garland and produced by [[Arthur Freed]].\n\nThe film was shot in Technicolor.\n\n==Reception==\nOn June 11, 1948, the picture finally went into release, costing $3,768,496.  It went over its budget by $553,888.\n\nAudiences failed to respond to the film's high-brow ambitions, and while many critics hailed its sophistication, box office results failed to follow suit.  The British author [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]], in his book ''The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years'', described it as being overall \"a neat moneymaker, but otherwise probably the least successful of Garland's MGM films.\"<ref>David Shipman ''The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years'', London: Macdonald, 1989, p. 249</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' offered, \"The Pirate, which came yesterday to the Radio City Music Hall, is a dazzling, spectacular extravaganza, shot through with all the colors of the rainbow and then some that Technicolor patented.  It takes this mammoth show some time to generate a full head of steam, but when it gets rolling it's thoroughly delightful.\"\n\n''[[The New York Herald Tribune]]'' wrote, \"At the Music Hall there is more dancing than script; more production pomp than sensible staging.  But with Gene Kelly hoofing like a dervish, Judy Garland changing character at the drop of a hat, and resplendent trappings, the show is bouncing and beautiful.\"\n\n''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' thought, \"Certainly no effort was spared; the cast is star-studded, and the settings and costumes are strikingly handsome.  Yet The Pirate is disappointing, especially in regards to its music.  The film has its moments, especially those in which Kelly dominates the screen.  Judy Garland handles a song as well as ever and has several excellent comedy scenes.\"\n\n''[[Time]]'' advised, \"As an all-out try at artful movie making, this is among the most interesting pictures of the year.

KOKC is an affiliate of [[Westwood One News]].  The station's studios are located in Northeast Oklahoma City and a transmitter site is located in [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]].  It is locally owned by [[Tyler Media]]. '''KOKC''' is a station broadcasting on 95.3 FM and [[clear-channel]] frequency of 1520&nbsp;kHz, which can be heard across much of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains at night. It is Central Oklahoma's primary entry point station for the [[Emergency Alert System]].\n\n==History==\n===The early years===\nFounded by Dudley Shaw, KFJF, as it was first known, started transmitting its 15-watt signal on Christmas Eve, 1922. Originally, the principal function of KFJF was to rebroadcast the programming of larger eastern stations.\n\nBy late 1924, KFJF increased its power to 125 watts; reaching as far away as New Jersey, and claimed to have over 100,000 listeners. Three years later, KFJF boosted its signal to 5,000 watts and moved to 1480 on the AM dial.\n\n===Birth of KOMA===\nIn 1932, the KFJF call letters were retired and the station became known as KOMA.<ref>{{cite news|title=KFJF Now KOMA|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1932/1932-09-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=September 1, 1932}}</ref> During this time, KOMA took on its familiar frequency when the Federal Communications Commission moved all AM radio stations 10 to 40 kilohertz up the dial. KOMA 1480 became KOMA 1520, and was operating at 50,000 watts by late 1946. It was around 1932 that the station moved studio facilities to the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Oklahoma City. AM facilities were constructed around the NE corner of Kelly and Britton where the present-day Oklahoma Centennial High School sits. KOMA-FM was granted a license on 100.1 FM and went on the air from the Biltmore downtown in the late 1940s.\n\nKOMA was purchased in 1938 by J.T. Griffin, the founder of [[KWTV]]. Griffin's son John and his brother-in-law were half of a partnership that was awarded FCC permission to put Channel 9 on the air. KWTV went on the air December 20, 1953, initially broadcasting from a shorter temporary tower on the KWTV studio grounds while the tall tower was under construction. The tall tower was at one time the tallest tower in the world, hence the calls KWTV which stands for World's Tallest Video. From 1953 to 1956, KWTV was operated in conjunction with KOMA.\n\nThat relationship was renewed in March 2007 when KOKC ended its news and weather partnership with [[KFOR-TV]] in favor of KWTV.\n\n===Top 40 years===\nKOMA was in a period of transition\u2014the first of many\u2014when in May 1958, the station ended its long-time affiliation with CBS to become \"an independent\". Thus was born Oklahoma City's true \"Rock N' Roll\" music station. (During this time, there was a brief affiliation with NBC.) KOMA was the third station in Oklahoma City to flip to a Top-40 format, behind KOCY and [[WKY]].\n\n[[Todd Storz]], the father of the [[Top 40]] [[radio format]], purchased KOMA in 1958, adding it to his list of stations which included [[WHB]] in Kansas City, [[KXOK (defunct)|KXOK]] in St. Louis, [[WQNO|WTIX]] in New Orleans, [[KTLK (AM)|WDGY]] in Minneapolis and [[WQAM-AM]], Miami.\n\nPrior to the sale to Storz, a preliminary agreement was reached with [[Gordon McLendon]] in February 1958 to purchase the station.(Broadcasting Magazine, \"Closed Circuit\", page 5 February 10, 1958) Had the sale been approved, KOMA would have been a sister station to KLIF-AM in Dallas, (now [[KFXR-AM]]) and [[KILT-AM]] in Houston, McLendon's other stations at the time. McLendon is widely credited for perfecting, during the 1950s and 1960s, the commercially successful Top 40 radio format created by Storz.\n\nIn 1961, KOMA became a totally automated station, but by 1964, returned to \"live\" programming.\n\n===Battle with WKY===\nEven with its 50,000 watt signal, KOMA faced a serious challenge during the 1960s and '70s from cross-town competitor WKY.\n\nMany times WKY was the ratings champ in the Oklahoma City metro area, while KOMA was much better known outside the market \u2013 due to nighttime \"skywave\" conditions on the AM band. 1974, however, was the year of KOMA, as Billboard magazine named the station medium market \"station of the year\" and Program Director J. Robert Dark was named Billboard's medium market Program Director of the year...finally knocking WKY off the top perch of Oklahoma City radio.\n\nWith little adjacent channel interference, KOMA had a tremendous reach with its directional antenna array. In many areas of the Plain States and the West, KOMA was the only Top 40 station serving some rural areas and small town markets.\n\nAt night, KOMA had a listenable signal in such far away locales as Denver, Salt Lake City, Phoenix and even Los Angeles. Fans of Rock and Roll and Top 40 music living in North and South Dakota in the 1960s and 1970s, for example, frequently waited until evening to enjoy listening to music on KOMA (as well as [[KAAY]] in Little Rock, AR; [[KSTP-AM]] in St Paul, MN; [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in Chicago; or [[KFYR-AM]] in Bismarck, ND) from a great distance away.\n\n===Changes over the airwaves===\nKOMA's Top-40 era officially ended on September 12, 1980 when \"KOMA Country\" was born. The first song played was [[John Denver]]'s \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy.\" KOMA would remain in the Storz family until July 1, 1984 when it was purchased by Price Communications.\n\nPrice Communications kept KOMA's country format in place until September 1985 when it was determined that FM competition was too much to overcome. KOMA adopted the slogan \"Forty Years of Favorites\", and specialized in a beautiful music format.\n\nOn September 1, 1988, Chicago-based Diamond Broadcasting, Inc. purchased KOMA along with sister station [[KRXO-FM|KRXO]]. On September 22, KOMA returned to the \"Glory Days\", bringing back the hits of the 1950s and 1960s to a familiar spot on the dial for those who grew up listening to the station.\n\nThe KOMA call letters made the transition to 92.5 FM on June 22, 1992 after Diamond Broadcasting entered a [[local marketing agreement]] with Wilks Schwartz Broadcasting, the first agreement of its kind in the OKC area.\n\n===Ownership changes===\nIn May 1998, it was announced that KOMA and KRXO were to be purchased by Renda Broadcasting. New state-of-the-art digital studios in northeast Oklahoma City were constructed for the arrival of the legendary station. At 3 PM on November 9, 1998, KOMA began broadcasting from the new location.\n\nThe studios ironically once housed KOMA's rival, WKY. Danny Williams, Ronnie Kaye and Fred Hendrickson all worked in the building during the 1970s when they were jocks for WKY.\n\nAfter 37 years of broadcasting in Moore, KOMA's studios became vacant and remained unoccupied until 2016 when the building was razed. KOKC's tower and transmitter facility remain at the former site.\n\nOn July 15, 2012, Ty and Tony Tyler's Tyler Media entered into an agreement with [[Renda Broadcasting]] to purchase that company's Oklahoma City radio cluster ([[KMGL]], [[KOMA (FM)|KOMA]], [[KRXO-FM|KRXO]] and KOKC) for $40 million. In accordance to limits imposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on the number of radio stations a single broadcasting entity can own in a single market, Tyler sold [[KTLR]] and [[KKNG]] to WPA Radio for $1.6 million.<ref>[http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2494638&spid=24698 Is Renda Cashing Out?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216060021/http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2494638&spid=24698 |date=2013-12-16 }}, ''RadioInk'', July 16, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/in-oklahoma-city-tyler-spins-two-so-it-can-buy-four-from-renda-for-40m In Oklahoma City, Tyler spins two so it can buy four from Renda (for $40M)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722222952/http://www.radio-info.com/news/in-oklahoma-city-tyler-spins-two-so-it-can-buy-four-from-renda-for-40m |date=2012-07-22 }}, ''RadioInfo'', July 16, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://radioinsight.com/headlines/58953/renda-sells-oklahoma-city-cluster/ Renda Sells Oklahoma City Cluster] RadioInsight July 16, 2012</ref> Tyler's purchase of KOKC and its sister stations was consummated on November 13, 2012.\n\n===Transition to talk===\nIn 2002, the station added ''[[The Radio Factor]]'' and CBS News at the top of the hour, fueling speculation about a move to a news talk format. Late that year, KOMA's then parent company, Renda Broadcasting, announced it was discontinuing the simulcast with [[KOMA (FM)|KOMA-FM]].\n\nThe launch date for News Talk 1520 KOMA was originally set for Monday, February 3, 2003. However, the disintegration of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] on re-entry prompted the change two days earlier.\n\n===End of an era===\nIn an effort to distinguish the station from [[KOMA (FM)|KOMA-FM]], 1520 KOMA changed its call letters to KOKC on August 27, 2004. The call letters had previously been used since the 1950s at KOKC 1490, a station based in Guthrie, Oklahoma.\n\n===Other changes===\nIn February, 2011, KOKC dropped its network affiliation with ABC in favor of CBS. During the 1930s and 1940s, CBS provided the station over 90% of its programming. The station has been affiliated with the network on several occasions, most recently when KOKC (then KOMA) flipped to a news-talk format in 2003. That relationship ended in 2004 in the wake of [[Rathergate]], a disputed CBS news report involving the military service record of then President [[George W. Bush]]. In September 2017, KOKC dropped CBS News once again, and changed network affiliation to Westwood One. In January 2020, the station laid off its morning and afternoon hosts. It now airs primarily syndicated talk programming.<ref>https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/193283/layoffs-at-tyler-media-oklahoma-city</ref>\n\n==Translators==\n{{RadioTranslators\n| call1    = K237GE\n| freq1    = 95.3 MHz\n| fid1     = 143059\n| watts1   = 250\n| haat1    = 302\n| class1   = D\n| city1    = Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n}}\n\n==OU Sooner sports==\nFor more than 20 years, KOKC was the flagship sports station of the [[University of Oklahoma]], covering [[Oklahoma Sooners|OU football, men's and women's basketball]] as well as [[Oklahoma Sooners|baseball]]. Much of that programming has been shifted to KOKC's sister station, KRXO.\n\n==March 2015 tornado tower damage==\n\nOn March 25, 2015, two of the station's three towers were destroyed, one other was heavily damaged when a tornado ripped through [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. KOKC's programming was temporarily moved to sister station, [[KEBC]]. KOKC engineers were able to utilize the remaining standing, but damaged, tower to transmit the signal at reduced power.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Paul Harvey]] (1918\u20132009) \u2013 ''The Rest of the Story''\n*[[Curt Gowdy]] (1919\u20132006) \u2013 was hired in 1946 by KOMA for play-by-play coverage of [[Oklahoma Sooners football|OU Sooner football]], as well as [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State (then Oklahoma A&M) basketball]] games.

AM facilities were constructed around the NE corner of Kelly and Britton where the present-day Oklahoma Centennial High School sits. KOMA-FM was granted a license on 100.1 FM and went on the air from the Biltmore downtown in the late 1940s.\n\nKOMA was purchased in 1938 by J.T. Griffin, the founder of [[KWTV]]. Griffin's son John and his brother-in-law were half of a partnership that was awarded FCC permission to put Channel 9 on the air. KWTV went on the air December 20, 1953, initially broadcasting from a shorter temporary tower on the KWTV studio grounds while the tall tower was under construction. The tall tower was at one time the tallest tower in the world, hence the calls KWTV which stands for World's Tallest Video. From 1953 to 1956, KWTV was operated in conjunction with KOMA.\n\nThat relationship was renewed in March 2007 when KOKC ended its news and weather partnership with [[KFOR-TV]] in favor of KWTV.\n\n===Top 40 years===\nKOMA was in a period of transition\u2014the first of many\u2014when in May 1958, the station ended its long-time affiliation with CBS to become \"an independent\". Thus was born Oklahoma City's true \"Rock N' Roll\" music station. (During this time, there was a brief affiliation with NBC.) KOMA was the third station in Oklahoma City to flip to a Top-40 format, behind KOCY and [[WKY]].\n\n[[Todd Storz]], the father of the [[Top 40]] [[radio format]], purchased KOMA in 1958, adding it to his list of stations which included [[WHB]] in Kansas City, [[KXOK (defunct)|KXOK]] in St. Louis, [[WQNO|WTIX]] in New Orleans, [[KTLK (AM)|WDGY]] in Minneapolis and [[WQAM-AM]], Miami.\n\nPrior to the sale to Storz, a preliminary agreement was reached with [[Gordon McLendon]] in February 1958 to purchase the station.(Broadcasting Magazine, \"Closed Circuit\", page 5 February 10, 1958) Had the sale been approved, KOMA would have been a sister station to KLIF-AM in Dallas, (now [[KFXR-AM]]) and [[KILT-AM]] in Houston, McLendon's other stations at the time. McLendon is widely credited for perfecting, during the 1950s and 1960s, the commercially successful Top 40 radio format created by Storz.\n\nIn 1961, KOMA became a totally automated station, but by 1964, returned to \"live\" programming.\n\n===Battle with WKY===\nEven with its 50,000 watt signal, KOMA faced a serious challenge during the 1960s and '70s from cross-town competitor WKY.\n\nMany times WKY was the ratings champ in the Oklahoma City metro area, while KOMA was much better known outside the market \u2013 due to nighttime \"skywave\" conditions on the AM band. 1974, however, was the year of KOMA, as Billboard magazine named the station medium market \"station of the year\" and Program Director J. Robert Dark was named Billboard's medium market Program Director of the year...finally knocking WKY off the top perch of Oklahoma City radio.\n\nWith little adjacent channel interference, KOMA had a tremendous reach with its directional antenna array. In many areas of the Plain States and the West, KOMA was the only Top 40 station serving some rural areas and small town markets.\n\nAt night, KOMA had a listenable signal in such far away locales as Denver, Salt Lake City, Phoenix and even Los Angeles. Fans of Rock and Roll and Top 40 music living in North and South Dakota in the 1960s and 1970s, for example, frequently waited until evening to enjoy listening to music on KOMA (as well as [[KAAY]] in Little Rock, AR; [[KSTP-AM]] in St Paul, MN; [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in Chicago; or [[KFYR-AM]] in Bismarck, ND) from a great distance away.\n\n===Changes over the airwaves===\nKOMA's Top-40 era officially ended on September 12, 1980 when \"KOMA Country\" was born. The first song played was [[John Denver]]'s \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy.\" KOMA would remain in the Storz family until July 1, 1984 when it was purchased by Price Communications.\n\nPrice Communications kept KOMA's country format in place until September 1985 when it was determined that FM competition was too much to overcome. KOMA adopted the slogan \"Forty Years of Favorites\", and specialized in a beautiful music format.\n\nOn September 1, 1988, Chicago-based Diamond Broadcasting, Inc. purchased KOMA along with sister station [[KRXO-FM|KRXO]]. On September 22, KOMA returned to the \"Glory Days\", bringing back the hits of the 1950s and 1960s to a familiar spot on the dial for those who grew up listening to the station.\n\nThe KOMA call letters made the transition to 92.5 FM on June 22, 1992 after Diamond Broadcasting entered a [[local marketing agreement]] with Wilks Schwartz Broadcasting, the first agreement of its kind in the OKC area.\n\n===Ownership changes===\nIn May 1998, it was announced that KOMA and KRXO were to be purchased by Renda Broadcasting. New state-of-the-art digital studios in northeast Oklahoma City were constructed for the arrival of the legendary station. At 3 PM on November 9, 1998, KOMA began broadcasting from the new location.\n\nThe studios ironically once housed KOMA's rival, WKY. Danny Williams, Ronnie Kaye and Fred Hendrickson all worked in the building during the 1970s when they were jocks for WKY.\n\nAfter 37 years of broadcasting in Moore, KOMA's studios became vacant and remained unoccupied until 2016 when the building was razed. KOKC's tower and transmitter facility remain at the former site.\n\nOn July 15, 2012, Ty and Tony Tyler's Tyler Media entered into an agreement with [[Renda Broadcasting]] to purchase that company's Oklahoma City radio cluster ([[KMGL]], [[KOMA (FM)|KOMA]], [[KRXO-FM|KRXO]] and KOKC) for $40 million. In accordance to limits imposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on the number of radio stations a single broadcasting entity can own in a single market, Tyler sold [[KTLR]] and [[KKNG]] to WPA Radio for $1.6 million.<ref>[http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2494638&spid=24698 Is Renda Cashing Out?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216060021/http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2494638&spid=24698 |date=2013-12-16 }}, ''RadioInk'', July 16, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/in-oklahoma-city-tyler-spins-two-so-it-can-buy-four-from-renda-for-40m In Oklahoma City, Tyler spins two so it can buy four from Renda (for $40M)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722222952/http://www.radio-info.com/news/in-oklahoma-city-tyler-spins-two-so-it-can-buy-four-from-renda-for-40m |date=2012-07-22 }}, ''RadioInfo'', July 16, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://radioinsight.com/headlines/58953/renda-sells-oklahoma-city-cluster/ Renda Sells Oklahoma City Cluster] RadioInsight July 16, 2012</ref> Tyler's purchase of KOKC and its sister stations was consummated on November 13, 2012.\n\n===Transition to talk===\nIn 2002, the station added ''[[The Radio Factor]]'' and CBS News at the top of the hour, fueling speculation about a move to a news talk format. Late that year, KOMA's then parent company, Renda Broadcasting, announced it was discontinuing the simulcast with [[KOMA (FM)|KOMA-FM]].\n\nThe launch date for News Talk 1520 KOMA was originally set for Monday, February 3, 2003. However, the disintegration of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] on re-entry prompted the change two days earlier.\n\n===End of an era===\nIn an effort to distinguish the station from [[KOMA (FM)|KOMA-FM]], 1520 KOMA changed its call letters to KOKC on August 27, 2004. The call letters had previously been used since the 1950s at KOKC 1490, a station based in Guthrie, Oklahoma.\n\n===Other changes===\nIn February, 2011, KOKC dropped its network affiliation with ABC in favor of CBS. During the 1930s and 1940s, CBS provided the station over 90% of its programming. The station has been affiliated with the network on several occasions, most recently when KOKC (then KOMA) flipped to a news-talk format in 2003. That relationship ended in 2004 in the wake of [[Rathergate]], a disputed CBS news report involving the military service record of then President [[George W. Bush]]. In September 2017, KOKC dropped CBS News once again, and changed network affiliation to Westwood One. In January 2020, the station laid off its morning and afternoon hosts. It now airs primarily syndicated talk programming.<ref>https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/193283/layoffs-at-tyler-media-oklahoma-city</ref>\n\n==Translators==\n{{RadioTranslators\n| call1    = K237GE\n| freq1    = 95.3 MHz\n| fid1     = 143059\n| watts1   = 250\n| haat1    = 302\n| class1   = D\n| city1    = Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n}}\n\n==OU Sooner sports==\nFor more than 20 years, KOKC was the flagship sports station of the [[University of Oklahoma]], covering [[Oklahoma Sooners|OU football, men's and women's basketball]] as well as [[Oklahoma Sooners|baseball]]. Much of that programming has been shifted to KOKC's sister station, KRXO.\n\n==March 2015 tornado tower damage==\n\nOn March 25, 2015, two of the station's three towers were destroyed, one other was heavily damaged when a tornado ripped through [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. KOKC's programming was temporarily moved to sister station, [[KEBC]]. KOKC engineers were able to utilize the remaining standing, but damaged, tower to transmit the signal at reduced power.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Paul Harvey]] (1918\u20132009) \u2013 ''The Rest of the Story''\n*[[Curt Gowdy]] (1919\u20132006) \u2013 was hired in 1946 by KOMA for play-by-play coverage of [[Oklahoma Sooners football|OU Sooner football]], as well as [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State (then Oklahoma A&M) basketball]] games.

As a result, manufacturers were pressurized to improve their responsivity and efficiency in terms of product development, operations, lead times, resource utilization, and quality control, which were coupled with complex supply chain networks, [[manufacturing execution system]]<nowiki/>s (MES) and [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems. A new concept was evolved to address these issues and enable organizations to dynamically, collaboratively, and cost-effectively integrate, optimize, and configure their manufacturing units and supply networks.

The concept was defined as: \u201cE-manufacturing is a systematic methodology that enables the manufacturing operations to successfully integrate with the functional objectives of an enterprise through the use of the Internet, tether-free (i.e., wireless, web, etc.) and predictive technologies.\u201d E-Manufacturing paradigm was enabled by the ubiquitous internet and telecommunication facilities (i.e. wireless, web, etc.), which helped manufacturing operators to achieve near-zero downtime (nZDM) performance and synchronize with the business systems.\n\nMaintenance operations are essential to minimize unplanned downtime, to assure product quality, to reduce customer dissatisfaction, and to maintain a competitive edge in the market. However, manufacturers struggle to find balanced maintenance strategies without compromising the system's reliability or productivity. Intelligent Maintenance Systems are designed to provide support tools for decision making to optimize maintenance operations. Intelligent prognostic and health management tools are necessary to identify practical, reliable, and cost-saving maintenance strategies to ensure nZDM in production, consistently. Dr. Jay Lee {{fact|date=April 2020}} first introduced the nZDM concept in 2000 while working for NSF I/UCRC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/home.jsp|title=NSF IUCRC {{!}} Home|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> in the area of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). The key focus was to measure the degradation of machines and processes to predict and prevent potential issues. Analytical techniques based on Big Data, along with a systematic toolbox approach, were first proposed by the IMS Center in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|date=December 2003|title=E-manufacturing\u2014fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|volume=19|issue=6|pages=501\u2013507|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imscenter.net/|title=Intelligent maintenance system|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n==Main Elements==\n\nNear-zero downtime manufacturing is based on two main technologies, namely (1) Accurate Diagnostics and (2) Real-time Prognostics{{citation needed}}. Both of these technologies are described as follows: \n \n===Prognostics===\n\nPrognostics aims to make accurate predictions of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery before a failure occurs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heng|first1=Aiwina|last2=Zhang|first2=Sheng|last3=Tan|first3=Andy C.C.|last4=Mathew|first4=Joseph|date=April 2009|title=Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=724\u2013739|bibcode=2009MSSP...23..724H|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.06.009}}</ref> Current prognostic approaches can be categorized into three classes, namely model-based, data-driven and hybrid prognostics approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Si|first1=Xiao-Sheng|last2=Wang|first2=Wenbin|last3=Hu|first3=Chang-Hua|last4=Zhou|first4=Dong-Hua|date=August 2011|title=Remaining useful life estimation \u2013 A review on the statistical data driven approaches|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2010.11.018}}</ref> Rotating machinery is of critical concern in the manufacturing industry.

In industrial applications, diagnosis is performed to detect the failure modes within a system or sub-system. In this process, time and frequency domain features are extracted from sensors and the data is analyzed using a model, which is designed to pass the information to the failure modes of the system{{citation needed}}. Using diverse analytic models and a systematic diagnosis approach provides a productive environment for the diagnosis of components during real-time monitoring{{citation needed}}. Bearing, shaft, electric motors, and gearbox are the most frequently studied components in manufacturing systems for accurate and reliable diagnostics{{citation needed}}.\n==Enabling Technologies==\n\nRecently emerging technologies such as the industrial internet of things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, and industrial artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will enable operation of industries in a flexible, efficient, and with near-zero downtime. These technologies aim to aid the intelligent manufacturing systems based on process monitoring hardware and software, signal processing techniques, sensor fusions tools, and diagnosis and prognosis technologies.\n\n=== Internet of things (IoT)===\nThe basic concept is the pervasive presence of things\u2013 such as sensors, actuators, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, etc. \u2013 around us which are able to interact and cooperate with each other to achieve common goals.

This concept was called E-manufacturing<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Wang|first2=Haixia|date=2008|title=New Technologies for Maintenance|journal=Complex System Maintenance Handbook|series=Springer Series in Reliability Engineering|language=en|publisher=Springer|pages=49\u201378|doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-011-7_3|isbn=978-1-84800-010-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=David Zhengwen|last2=Anosike|first2=Anthony Ikechukwu|last3=Lim|first3=Ming Kim|last4=Akanle|first4=Oluwaremilekun Mowanuola|date=October 2006|title=An agent-based approach for e-manufacturing and supply chain integration|journal=Computers & Industrial Engineering|volume=51|issue=2|pages=343\u2013360|doi=10.1016/j.cie.2006.02.012}}</ref>, which was first envisioned by AMR Research Inc. in 2000<ref>{{cite journal|title=AMR Advanced Market Research - Global Data Collection CATI & Online|url=https://amr-research.com/en/|journal=AMR}}</ref> and conceptualized by Lee et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|date=December 2003|title=E-manufacturing\u2014fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|volume=19|issue=6|pages=501\u2013507|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7}}</ref> in 2002. The concept was defined as: \u201cE-manufacturing is a systematic methodology that enables the manufacturing operations to successfully integrate with the functional objectives of an enterprise through the use of the Internet, tether-free (i.e., wireless, web, etc.) and predictive technologies.\u201d E-Manufacturing paradigm was enabled by the ubiquitous internet and telecommunication facilities (i.e. wireless, web, etc.), which helped manufacturing operators to achieve near-zero downtime (nZDM) performance and synchronize with the business systems.\n\nMaintenance operations are essential to minimize unplanned downtime, to assure product quality, to reduce customer dissatisfaction, and to maintain a competitive edge in the market. However, manufacturers struggle to find balanced maintenance strategies without compromising the system's reliability or productivity. Intelligent Maintenance Systems are designed to provide support tools for decision making to optimize maintenance operations. Intelligent prognostic and health management tools are necessary to identify practical, reliable, and cost-saving maintenance strategies to ensure nZDM in production, consistently. Dr. Jay Lee {{fact|date=April 2020}} first introduced the nZDM concept in 2000 while working for NSF I/UCRC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/home.jsp|title=NSF IUCRC {{!}} Home|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> in the area of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). The key focus was to measure the degradation of machines and processes to predict and prevent potential issues. Analytical techniques based on Big Data, along with a systematic toolbox approach, were first proposed by the IMS Center in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|date=December 2003|title=E-manufacturing\u2014fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|volume=19|issue=6|pages=501\u2013507|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imscenter.net/|title=Intelligent maintenance system|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n==Main Elements==\n\nNear-zero downtime manufacturing is based on two main technologies, namely (1) Accurate Diagnostics and (2) Real-time Prognostics{{citation needed}}. Both of these technologies are described as follows: \n \n===Prognostics===\n\nPrognostics aims to make accurate predictions of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery before a failure occurs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heng|first1=Aiwina|last2=Zhang|first2=Sheng|last3=Tan|first3=Andy C.C.|last4=Mathew|first4=Joseph|date=April 2009|title=Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=724\u2013739|bibcode=2009MSSP...23..724H|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.06.009}}</ref> Current prognostic approaches can be categorized into three classes, namely model-based, data-driven and hybrid prognostics approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Si|first1=Xiao-Sheng|last2=Wang|first2=Wenbin|last3=Hu|first3=Chang-Hua|last4=Zhou|first4=Dong-Hua|date=August 2011|title=Remaining useful life estimation \u2013 A review on the statistical data driven approaches|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2010.11.018}}</ref> Rotating machinery is of critical concern in the manufacturing industry. Hence, the majority of the studies in literature concentrated on prognostics and health management (PHM) applications, including but not limited to, standard rotary machinery components, such as bearings, gears, shafts, and motors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Wu|first2=Fangji|last3=Zhao|first3=Wenyu|last4=Ghaffari|first4=Masoud|last5=Liao|first5=Linxia|last6=Siegel|first6=David|date=January 2014|title=Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systems\u2014Reviews, methodology and applications|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=42|issue=1\u20132|pages=314\u2013334|bibcode=2014MSSP...42..314L|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.06.004}}</ref> A significant contribution has been made in are using vibration signals for prognostics. However, very few studies have been carried out on stator current monitoring or acoustic signals. A preliminary study by Tandon et al. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tandon|first1=N.|last2=Yadava|first2=G.S.|last3=Ramakrishna|first3=K.M.|date=January 2007|title=A comparison of some condition monitoring techniques for the detection of defect in induction motor ball bearings|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=21|issue=1|pages=244\u2013256|bibcode=2007MSSP...21..244T|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2005.08.005}}</ref>\u00a0suggested that current signatures are inexpensive and easy to measure, but acoustic signals reveal fault characteristics early.\n\n===Diagnostics===\n\nThe fault diagnosis is performed to inspect whether a piece of machinery is healthy or has a fault. In industrial applications, diagnosis is performed to detect the failure modes within a system or sub-system. In this process, time and frequency domain features are extracted from sensors and the data is analyzed using a model, which is designed to pass the information to the failure modes of the system{{citation needed}}. Using diverse analytic models and a systematic diagnosis approach provides a productive environment for the diagnosis of components during real-time monitoring{{citation needed}}. Bearing, shaft, electric motors, and gearbox are the most frequently studied components in manufacturing systems for accurate and reliable diagnostics{{citation needed}}.\n==Enabling Technologies==\n\nRecently emerging technologies such as the industrial internet of things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, and industrial artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will enable operation of industries in a flexible, efficient, and with near-zero downtime. These technologies aim to aid the realization of intelligent manufacturing systems based on process monitoring hardware and software, signal processing techniques, sensor fusions tools, and diagnosis and prognosis technologies.\n\n=== Internet of things (IoT)===\nThe basic concept is the pervasive presence of things\u2013 such as sensors, actuators, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, etc. \u2013 around us which are able to interact and cooperate with each other to achieve common goals.
