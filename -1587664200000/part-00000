Agathon wrote about the \"nation of Onogur Bul\u011fars\",{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros I]] stated that Kubrat was lord of the ''Onogundurs'', [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] referred to them as ''Onogundur Bulgars'' and  [[Constantine VII]] remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves ''Onogundurs''. Variations of the name include ''Onoguri, Onoghuri, Onghur, Ongur, Onghuri, Onguri, Onogundur, Unogundur'' and ''Unokundur''. There are several theories about the origin of the name Onogur. In some Turkic languages ''on'' means \"10\" and ''\u011fur'' \"arrow\"; and \"ten arrows\" a federation of ten tribes, i.e. the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].  Within the Turkic languages, \"z\" sounds in the easternmost languages tend to have become \"r\" in the westernmost Turkic languages; therefore, the ethnonym [[Turkic tribal confederations|Oghuz]] may be the source of Oghur; that is, ''on O\u011fur'' would mean \"ten clans of Oghuz\".\n\n==Establishment==\nBetween 630 and 635, [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kubrat]] managed to unite the [[Onogurs|Onogur]] [[Bulgars]] with the tribes of [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Utigurs]] under a single rule, creating a powerful confederation which was referred to by the [[medieval]] authors in [[Western Europe]] as Old Great Bulgaria,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople]], ''Historia syntomos, breviarium''</ref> or ''Patria Onoguria''.

There they established [[Volga Bulgaria]], at the confluence of the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Kama River|Kama]]. As the Volga or Silver [[Bulgars]] (''Bessermens''), they converted voluntarily to [[Islam]] in the 9th century. They managed to preserve their national identity well into the 13th century, by repelling the first [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks in 1223. However, they were eventually subdued, their capital [[Bolghar]] city became one of major cities of the [[Golden Horde]] of the Mongols and the Bulgars mixed with the [[Tatars]]. The citizens of the modern [[Russian Federation|Russian]] republics of [[Tatarstan]] and [[Chuvashia Republic|Chuvashia]] are considered to be descendants of those Bulgars.\n\n===Bulgars in Vojvodina and Macedonia===\n[[Kuber]] ruled in [[Sirmium]] over a mixed group of peoples \u2013 [[Bulgars]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] subjects, [[Early Slavs|Slavs]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[tribes]] \u2013 as a vassal of the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar]] [[Khagan]]. After a revolt he led his people to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. There he had settled in the region of Keremisia and made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city of [[Thessaloniki]]. After this, he disappears from history and his people were later consolidated into the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Krum]].\n\n===Bulgars in Italy===\nOther [[Bulgars]], circa 662, led by their \"Duke Alzeco\" ([[Alcek]]) sought refuge from the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] with the [[Lombards]] and requested land from the [[Grimoald, King of the Lombards|Lombard King Grimoald I]] in exchange for military service \"for an uncertain reason\", initially staying near [[Ravenna]] and later moving further south. Grimoald sent Alcek and his followers to his son [[Romuald I of Benevento|Romuald]] in [[Benevento]] and they were then granted by Romuald land northeast of [[Naples]] in the \"spacious but up till that time deserted\" towns of [[Sepino]], Bovianum ([[Boiano]]), and [[Isernia]], in the present-day region of [[Molise]] in the [[Apennines]].

Agathon wrote about the \"nation of Onogur Bul\u011fars\",{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros I]] stated that Kubrat was lord of the ''Onogundurs'', [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] referred to them as ''Onogundur Bulgars'' and  [[Constantine VII]] remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves ''Onogundurs''. Variations of the name include ''Onoguri, Onoghuri, Onghur, Ongur, Onghuri, Onguri, Onogundur, Unogundur'' and ''Unokundur''. There are several theories about the origin of the name Onogur. In some Turkic languages ''on'' means \"10\" and ''\u011fur'' \"arrow\"; and \"ten arrows\" a federation of ten tribes, i.e. the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].  Within the Turkic languages, \"z\" sounds in the easternmost languages tend to have become \"r\" in the westernmost Turkic languages; therefore, the ethnonym [[Turkic tribal confederations|Oghuz]] may be the source of Oghur; that is, ''on O\u011fur'' would mean \"ten clans of Oghuz\".\n\n==Establishment==\nBetween 630 and 635, [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kubrat]] managed to unite the [[Onogurs|Onogur]] [[Bulgars]] with the tribes of [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Utigurs]] under a single rule, creating a powerful confederation which was referred to by the [[medieval]] authors in [[Western Europe]] as Old Great Bulgaria,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople]], ''Historia syntomos, breviarium''</ref> or ''Patria Onoguria''.

There they established [[Volga Bulgaria]], at the confluence of the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Kama River|Kama]]. As the Volga or Silver [[Bulgars]] (''Bessermens''), they converted voluntarily to [[Islam]] in the 9th century. They managed to preserve their national identity well into the 13th century, by repelling the first [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks in 1223. However, they were eventually subdued, their capital [[Bolghar]] city became one of major cities of the [[Golden Horde]] of the Mongols and the Bulgars mixed with the [[Tatars]]. The citizens of the modern [[Russian Federation|Russian]] republics of [[Tatarstan]] and [[Chuvashia Republic|Chuvashia]] are considered to be descendants of those Bulgars.\n\n===Bulgars in Vojvodina and Macedonia===\n[[Kuber]] ruled in [[Sirmium]] over a mixed group of peoples \u2013 [[Bulgars]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] subjects, [[Early Slavs|Slavs]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[tribes]] \u2013 as a vassal of the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar]] [[Khagan]].

Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct |title = Wikipedia:Administrators |accessdate = July 12, 2009 |date = October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |title = Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |accessdate = September 24, 2009 |date = January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829 |title = 3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins |last = Meyer |first = Robinson |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date = July 16, 2012 |accessdate = September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrats]] name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\n\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,<ref group=note>See for example the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard|Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard]] or [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard|Neutral Point of View Noticeboard]], created to address content falling under their respective areas.</ref> or seek outside input through [[Wikipedia:Third opinion|third opinion requests]] or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a [[WP:RfC|\"request for comment\"]].\n\n==== Arbitration Committee ====\n\n{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,<ref name=\"emory disputes handled 1\" /> functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the<!-- The committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may NOT (directly) rule that a certain content is inappropriate. --> content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|biased]]). Its remedies<!-- Although a caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. This could be quoted or changed. --> include cautions and [[WP:Probation|probations]] (used in 63% of cases) and [[WP:BAN|banning editors from articles]] (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus<!-- This needs to be clarified. Anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as \"edit warring\". --> or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Wikitruth through Wikiorder |ssrn = 1354424 |journal = [[Emory Law Journal]] |volume = 59 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |pages = 151\u2013210 |author = David A.

Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles [[George W.

Originally, Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]].

The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. [[Everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |title = The next generation of online encyclopedias |last = Frauenfelder |first = Mark |website = CNN.com |date = November 21, 2000 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date = August 14, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g. [[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]]).<ref name=\"gnu.org\">[https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html The Free Encyclopedia Project] gnu.org ( {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64QXgZhy2?url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html |date=January 3, 2012}})</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n\nSubsequent collaborative [[knowledge base|knowledge]] websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]] are not as open.

Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct |title = Wikipedia:Administrators |accessdate = July 12, 2009 |date = October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |title = Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |accessdate = September 24, 2009 |date = January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829 |title = 3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins |last = Meyer |first = Robinson |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date = July 16, 2012 |accessdate = September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrats]] name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\n\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,<ref group=note>See for example the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard|Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard]] or [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard|Neutral Point of View Noticeboard]], created to address content falling under their respective areas.</ref> or seek outside input through [[Wikipedia:Third opinion|third opinion requests]] or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a [[WP:RfC|\"request for comment\"]].\n\n==== Arbitration Committee ====\n\n{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,<ref name=\"emory disputes handled 1\" /> functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the<!-- The committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may NOT (directly) rule that a certain content is inappropriate. --> content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|biased]]). Its remedies<!-- Although a caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. This could be quoted or changed. --> include cautions and [[WP:Probation|probations]] (used in 63% of cases) and [[WP:BAN|banning editors from articles]] (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus<!-- This needs to be clarified. Anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as \"edit warring\". --> or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Wikitruth through Wikiorder |ssrn = 1354424 |journal = [[Emory Law Journal]] |volume = 59 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |pages = 151\u2013210 |author = David A.

Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise.

This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to CC\">{{cite web |url = https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update |title = Resolution:License update |year = 2007 |author = Walter Vermeir |publisher = Wikizine |accessdate = December 4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{Srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref name=\"voteresult\" /><ref name=\"MW licensing QA\">{{cite web |url = http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Questions_and_Answers |title = Licensing update/Questions and Answers |website = Wikimedia Meta |publisher = Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate = February 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"MW licensing timeline 1\">{{cite web |url = http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Timeline |title = Licensing_update/Timeline |website = Wikimedia Meta |publisher = Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate = April 5, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"WP blog license migration\">{{cite web |url = http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration |title = Wikimedia community approves license migration |website = Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate = May 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]). Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. [[Creative Commons]]' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.<ref name=\"NYT photos on WP\">{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html |title = Wikipedia May Be a Font of Facts, but It's a Desert for Photos |date = July 19, 2009 |last = Cohen |first = Noam |work = New York Times |accessdate = March 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia.

The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. [[Everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |title = The next generation of online encyclopedias |last = Frauenfelder |first = Mark |website = CNN.com |date = November 21, 2000 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date = August 14, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g. [[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]]).<ref name=\"gnu.org\">[https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html The Free Encyclopedia Project] gnu.org ( {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64QXgZhy2?url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html |date=January 3, 2012}})</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n\nSubsequent collaborative [[knowledge base|knowledge]] websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]] are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as ''[[Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the online wiki encyclopedias ''[[Scholarpedia]]'' and [[Citizendium]]. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Orlowski18\"/><ref name=\"JayLyman\">{{cite news |first = Jay |last = Lyman |url = http://www.crmbuyer.com/story/53137.html |title = Wikipedia Co-Founder Planning New Expert-Authored Site |publisher = LinuxInsider |date = September 20, 2006 |accessdate = June 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Internet|Wikipedia}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]]\n* [[Democratization of knowledge]]\n* [[Interpedia]], an early proposal for a collaborative [[Internet]] encyclopedia\n* [[List of online encyclopedias]]\n* [[List of Wikipedia controversies]]\n* [[Network effect]]\n* [[Outline of Wikipedia]]\u2014guide to the subject of ''Wikipedia'' presented as a [[tree structure]]d list of its subtopics; for an outline of the contents of Wikipedia, see [[Portal:Contents/Outlines]]\n* [[Print Wikipedia]] art project to visualize how big Wikipedia is.

The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, [[Pliny the Younger]], who at that point was staying at [[Misenum]], on the other side of the Bay of Naples about {{convert|29|km}} from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, [[pyroclastic flow]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\n\n<blockquote>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of [[Vesuvius]]; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancient-literature.com/rome_pliny_epistulae_VI16.html |title=Pliny the Younger, Epistulae VI.16 & VI.20 |website=Ancient Literature |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Stratigraphic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|350px|right|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown; [[Pliny the Younger]] was at [[Misenum]].]]\n\nSigur\u00f0sson, Cashdollar, and [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Sparks]] undertook a detailed stratigraphic study of the layers of ash, based on excavations and surveys, which was published in 1982. Their conclusion was that the eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD unfolded in two phases, [[Vesuvian eruption|Vesuvian]] and [[Pelean eruption|Pelean]], which alternated six times. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Haraldur |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first2=Stanford |last2=Cashdollar |first3=R.

Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep layer, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. [[Herculaneum]] and [[Oplontis]] received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments up to {{convert|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} deep. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nThe eruption is viewed as primarily [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]], where the chief energy supporting the blast column came from escaping steam created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, coming into contact with hot magma.\n\n====Timing of explosions====\n\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigur\u00f0sson and Casey concluded that an early explosion produced a column of ash and pumice which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum, which was upwind.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002}}</ref> Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents.\n\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing [[Rectina]] to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\n\n=== Magnetic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Wn\u0119trze krateru Wezuwiusz.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the crater of Vesuvius]]\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200&nbsp;samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the {{nowrap|deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}.</ref>}} The deposits were placed by [[pyroclastic density current]]s (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAll crystal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it [[ferromagnetic]], as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are [[magnetic dipole]]s, are held in alignment by being bound in a [[crystal]]line structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=10}}.</ref> Heating the material adds [[internal energy]] to it. At the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever [[magnetic field]] might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \"block out\" non-residual fields.\n\nA [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a [[spectrum]] of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in 79 AD. The overall field of the sample was the [[vector sum]] of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\n\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of {{nowrap|{{convert|40|C-change|sigfig=1}}}} from {{convert|100|C|F|sigfig=2}} until it reached the low unblocking temperature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=8}}.</ref> Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \"fabric\" of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows:\n\n* On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in|sigfig=1}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}.</ref> It heated the roof tiles to {{convert|120|-|140|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}.</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\n\n* Early in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was {{convert|180|-|220|C|sigfig=2}}, minimum temperatures; of the second, {{convert|220|-|260|C|sigfig=2}}. The depositional temperature of the first was {{convert|140|-|300|C|sigfig=2}}. Upstream and downstream of the flow it was {{convert|300|-|360|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C|sigfig=3}}, the boiling point of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}.</ref> The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one metre more of deposits fell over the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\n==The Two Plinys==\n[[Image:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by [[Pliny the Younger]], who was 17 at the time of the eruption,<ref>His 18th year by Roman reckoning, as they counted the first 12 months as the first year</ref> to the historian [[Tacitus]] and written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= C.

His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor woke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\", which is evidence for a [[tsunami]]. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\n{{further information|Pliny the Elder}}\n\nPliny's uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Bassus{{fact|date=April 2020}}) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast.

Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \"[[Fortune favours the bold|Fortune favors the brave]]\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} from Pompeii), where [[Pomponianus]] was.<ref name=PYVI.16/> Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.<ref name=PYVI.16/> \n\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages.

They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again, but the wind had not changed.

His friends then departed, escaping ultimately by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm | author = Richard V.

The large majority of extant medieval manuscript copies \u2013 there are no surviving Roman copies \u2013 indicate a date corresponding to August 24, and from the discovery of the cities into the 21st century this was accepted by most scholars and by nearly all books written about Pompeii and Herculaneum for the general public.\n\nSince at least the late [[18th century]], a minority among archaeologists and other scientists have suggested that the eruption began ''after'' August 24, during the autumn, perhaps in October or November. In 1797 the researcher Carlo Rosini reported that excavations at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] had uncovered traces of fruits and [[braziers]] indicative of the autumn, not the summer. \n\nMore recently, in 1990 and 2001, archaeologists discovered more remnants of autumnal fruits (such as the pomegranate), the remains of victims of the eruption in heavy clothing, and large earthenware storage vessels laden with wine (at the time of their burial by Vesuvius).

Given the limited space on each coin, his achievements were stamped on the coins using an arcane encoding.

The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, [[Pliny the Younger]], who at that point was staying at [[Misenum]], on the other side of the Bay of Naples about {{convert|29|km}} from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, [[pyroclastic flow]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\n\n<blockquote>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of [[Vesuvius]]; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancient-literature.com/rome_pliny_epistulae_VI16.html |title=Pliny the Younger, Epistulae VI.16 & VI.20 |website=Ancient Literature |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Stratigraphic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|350px|right|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Modern coast lines are shown; [[Pliny the Younger]] was at [[Misenum]].]]\n\nSigur\u00f0sson, Cashdollar, and [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Sparks]] undertook a detailed stratigraphic study of the layers of ash, based on excavations and surveys, which was published in 1982. Their conclusion was that the eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD unfolded in two phases, [[Vesuvian eruption|Vesuvian]] and [[Pelean eruption|Pelean]], which alternated six times. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Haraldur |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first2=Stanford |last2=Cashdollar |first3=R.

Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep layer, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. [[Herculaneum]] and [[Oplontis]] received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments up to {{convert|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} deep. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nThe eruption is viewed as primarily [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]], where the chief energy supporting the blast column came from escaping steam created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, coming into contact with hot magma.\n\n====Timing of explosions====\n\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigur\u00f0sson and Casey concluded that an early explosion produced a column of ash and pumice which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum, which was upwind.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002}}</ref> Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents.\n\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing [[Rectina]] to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\n\n=== Magnetic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Wn\u0119trze krateru Wezuwiusz.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the crater of Vesuvius]]\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200&nbsp;samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the {{nowrap|deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}.</ref>}} The deposits were placed by [[pyroclastic density current]]s (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAll crystal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it [[ferromagnetic]], as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are [[magnetic dipole]]s, are held in alignment by being bound in a [[crystal]]line structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=10}}.</ref> Heating the material adds [[internal energy]] to it. At the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever [[magnetic field]] might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \"block out\" non-residual fields.\n\nA [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a [[spectrum]] of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in 79 AD. The overall field of the sample was the [[vector sum]] of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\n\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of {{nowrap|{{convert|40|C-change|sigfig=1}}}} from {{convert|100|C|F|sigfig=2}} until it reached the low unblocking temperature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=8}}.</ref> Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \"fabric\" of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows:\n\n* On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in|sigfig=1}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}.</ref> It heated the roof tiles to {{convert|120|-|140|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}.</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\n\n* Early in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was {{convert|180|-|220|C|sigfig=2}}, minimum temperatures; of the second, {{convert|220|-|260|C|sigfig=2}}. The depositional temperature of the first was {{convert|140|-|300|C|sigfig=2}}. Upstream and downstream of the flow it was {{convert|300|-|360|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C|sigfig=3}}, the boiling point of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}.</ref> The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one metre more of deposits fell over the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\n==The Two Plinys==\n[[Image:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by [[Pliny the Younger]], who was 17 at the time of the eruption,<ref>His 18th year by Roman reckoning, as they counted the first 12 months as the first year</ref> to the historian [[Tacitus]] and written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= C.

[...] it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as it was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.}}\n\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor woke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\", which is evidence for a [[tsunami]]. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\n{{further information|Pliny the Elder}}\n\nPliny's uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Bassus{{fact|date=April 2020}}) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast.

Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \"[[Fortune favours the bold|Fortune favors the brave]]\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} from Pompeii), where [[Pomponianus]] was.<ref name=PYVI.16/> Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.<ref name=PYVI.16/> \n\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages.

They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again, but the wind had not changed.

The large majority of extant medieval manuscript copies \u2013 there are no surviving Roman copies \u2013 indicate a date corresponding to August 24, and from the discovery of the cities into the 21st century this was accepted by most scholars and by nearly all books written about Pompeii and Herculaneum for the general public.\n\nSince at least the late [[18th century]], a minority among archaeologists and other scientists have suggested that the eruption began ''after'' August 24, during the autumn, perhaps in October or November. In 1797 the researcher Carlo Rosini reported that excavations at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] had uncovered traces of fruits and [[braziers]] indicative of the autumn, not the summer. \n\nMore recently, in 1990 and 2001, archaeologists discovered more remnants of autumnal fruits (such as the pomegranate), the remains of victims of the eruption in heavy clothing, and large earthenware storage vessels laden with wine (at the time of their burial by Vesuvius). The wine-related discovery may show that the eruption was after the year's grape harvest and wine making.<ref name=\"journalvolcanology\">{{harvnb|Rolandi|2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a study of prevailing winds in Campania showed that the southeasterly debris pattern of the first-century eruption is quite consistent with an autumn event, and inconsistent with an August date.

Given the limited space on each coin, his achievements were stamped on the coins using an arcane encoding. Two of these coins, from early in Titus' reign, were found in a hoard recovered at Pompeii's House of the Golden Bracelet. Although the coins' minting dates are somewhat in dispute,<ref name=journalvolcanology /> a numismatic expert at the [[British Museum]], Richard Abdy, concluded that the latest coin in the hoard was minted on or after June 24 (the first date of Titus' reign) and before September 1 of 79 AD.

Highlights of the season included a 4-0 home win over South London rivals [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], a crushing win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] (5-2 at home), doing the double over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (2-0 home, 3-2 away) and a shock 1-0 away win over that season's champions, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

inaugural season of the [[FA Premier League]], their seventh successive season of top-division football and the 16th since their election to the Football League.\n\n==Season summary==\n1992\u201393 began as a struggle for Wimbledon, with the club third from bottom on Boxing Day. However, the team recovered well in the new year and finished the season in a comfortable 12th place, above more highly fancied and wealthier clubs like [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Highlights of the season included a 4-0 home win over South London rivals [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], a crushing win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] (5-2 at home), doing the double over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (2-0 home, 3-2 away) and a shock 1-0 away win over that season's champions, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Striker [[Dean Holdsworth]] scored 19 league goals for the club to finish the season as one of the Premier League's top goalscorers.\n\n==Kit==\nWimbledon's kit was manufactured by English company [[Admiral Sportswear|Admiral]]. The kits carried no sponsorship for the season.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1992\u201393 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1992\u201393 FA Premier League|showteam=WDN}}\n\n==Results==\n''Wimbledon's score

The next game was a disappointment as they lost 2-1 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at [[Maine Road]], but highly rated 19-year-old midfielder [[Steve McManaman]] managed to score his first goal for the club in this game.\n\nRecord signing [[Dean Saunders]] found the net for the first time on 27 August, scoring the only goal of a 1-0 home win over [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queen's Park Rangers]], Saunders had also missed a penalty in the match at Manchester City.\n\nThe month ended on a high as the Reds triumphed 3-1 over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Merseyside derby]] at Anfield.\n\n===September===\nSeptember saw Liverpool disappoint in the league, losing at [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], drawing with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], and only managing a narrow win at newly promoted relegation favourites [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].\n\nThere was more success on the European front, as Liverpool marked the end of their six-year ban by defeating [[Kuusysi Lahti]] 6-1 in the [[UEFA Cup]] first round first leg at Anfield, with Dean Saunders scoring four goals and [[Ray Houghton]] scoring twice.\n\nOn 23 September, winger [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], a key part in Liverpool's successes since his arrival in 1987, was told that he would be out of action until at least January due to an achilles tendon injury. Although he did make a brief return to the side in the new year, he was soon out of action again.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=barnes+and+liverpool&DateFromDD=01&DateFromMM=Aug&DateFromYY=1991&DateToDD=30&DateToMM=Apr&DateToYY=1992&ResultListMax=200&head=&byline=&sect=&Caption=&edn=&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortField=SDate&Submit1=Search&BackDD=Day&BackMM=Month&BackYY=Year&source=thetimes&SortField=Pub&SortOrder=asc&SortField=EDN&SortOrder=asc&SortField=Page&SortOrder=asc&ST=NS&SortSpec=&ResultMaxDocs=200&Site=ALL&Collection=NI&ResultCount=20&summreqd=yes&indexkey=169E485165195409790&advsrch=0&QueryText=%28barnes+and+liverpool%29+%3CAND%3E+%28PUB%3DBOTH%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D8%2F1%2F1991%29+%3CAND%3E+%28SDate%3C%3D4%2F30%2F1992%29%29&_P=1]</ref>\n\n===October===\nGraeme Souness pulled off one of the biggest transfer bargains of the season when he paid [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] \u00a3300,000 for full-back [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1971)|Rob Jones]]. Jones, who turned 20 a month after arriving at [[Anfield]], broke into the Liverpool first team almost instantly, and was capped by England after just four months of First Division football.\n\nLiverpool's disappointing league form continued throughout October as they were held to draws by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and could only scrape a 1-0 win over struggling [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], though there was better news in the cup competitions as they progressed to the next stage of the UEFA Cup and the League Cup, though they were held to a draw by [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] strugglers [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in the League Cup third round, and were left with an uphill struggle in the UEFA Cup after losing 2-0 to [[Auxerre]] of [[France]] in the second round first leg.\n\n===November===\nNovember began on a high note as Liverpool overturned Auxerre's 2-0 lead in the UEFA Cup to win the second leg 3-0. Their hopes of a quarter-final appearance were boosted at the end of the month when they won the third round first leg 2-0 win over [[FC Tirol Innsbruck|Swarovski Tirol]] in [[Austria]]. The Reds also overcame Port Vale in the League Cup by winning the replay 4-1 at [[Vale Park]].\n\nHowever, there was little improvement in the league as a defeat by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and goalless draws at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] - both struggling at the wrong end of the First Division - left a league title win looking unlikely for this season. Their only league win of the month came when they beat [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] 2-1 at Anfield.\n\n===December===\nDecember began on a humiliating note for the Reds as they suffered a shock League Cup exit at the hands of [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in the fourth round, losing 1-0 to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] underdogs at [[London Road Stadium|London Road]].\n\nThey did, however, progress to the last eight of the UEFA Cup, beating Swarovski Tirol 4-0 in the third round second leg at Anfield with Dean Saunders scoring a hat-trick, taking his European tally to nine goals.\n\nDecember brought little change in Liverpool's league fortunes, however. They went through the month unbeaten in the First Division, managing wins over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] but being held to draws by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] (in a game where 18-year-old midfielder [[Jamie Redknapp]] scored his first Liverpool goal), [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] and last of all [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the Merseyside derby at [[Goodison Park]]. They ended 1991 in sixth place, with their great north western rivals Manchester United top of the pack with a two-point advantage and two games in hand over a resurgent [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=28&Month=Dec&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===January===\nAs the new year dawned, Liverpool began an upturn in league fortunes as they won all four of their games. There was also good news in the [[FA Cup]] as they travelled to [[Gresty Road]] to take on Fourth Division Crewe Alexandra, winning 4-0 and with [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] making an explosive - though ultimately brief - comeback from his absence by scoring a hat-trick.\n\nLiverpool ended the month in third place, just eight points behind leaders Manchester United and six points behind second placed Leeds United, suggesting that they might still be able to win the title.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Jan&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===February===\nLiverpool managed to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals, but not without difficulty. The fourth round visit to Second Division underdogs [[Bristol Rovers]] saw them held to a 1-1 draw, and the replay at Anfield brought a narrow 2-1 win. The fifth round saw them travel to [[Suffolk]] for a clash with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] - Second Division promotion contenders - which ended in a goalless draw. Once again, Liverpool won the Anfield replay, but it was also a narrow victory as they needed extra time to manage a 3-2 win as the score stood at 1-1 with 90 minutes on the clock.\n\nAfter an excellent series of league results in January had raised hopes of a late run to the title, February was a disaster which effectively killed off talk of Liverpool winning the last old First Division title - as the top flight of English football would become the [[FA Premier League]] from the start of the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93 season]]. The month began with a 2-1 home defeat by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], followed by a goalless draw at relegation threatened [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and a 3-0 hammering at fellow strugglers [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. The month ended with another struggling side, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], paying a visit to Anfield, but neither side could find the net and the match ended as a goalless draw. The Reds ended the month fifth in the league, but were now 13 points adrift of leaders Manchester United with 12 games to go. It was now looking as though Liverpool would finish outside the top two for the first time since 1981, as 11 points separated them from second placed Leeds United.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Feb&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===March===\nA 4-1 aggregate defeat by [[Genoa]] of [[Italy]] in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals ended Liverpool's hopes of a glorious return to European football, but their last hope of silverware was kept alive when recently signed midfielder [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] - whose last minute goal against them for former club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] had deprived them of title glory in 1989 - scored the only goal for a quarter-final win over Aston Villa in the [[FA Cup]].\n\nLiverpool's league form improved as they managed wins over West Ham United, Notts County and Tottenham Hotspur, but were defeated by Crystal Palace and Sheffield United, ensuring that they ended the month no higher than fourth in the league. The title was still a mathematical possibility as they trailed leaders Manchester United by 12 points with seven games remaining at the end of the month, but it now appeared a practical impossibility and Liverpool's efforts were now better focused on FA Cup success.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=31&Month=Mar&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===April===\nIt had been a long and hard route for Liverpool in the FA Cup, but they finally did get to the FA Cup final. The semi-final draw paired them with Second Division [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], and the game was still deadlock with 90 minutes on the clock. The [[Hampshire]] side went ahead in extra time, and only a late equaliser by [[Ronnie Whelan]] prevented a defeat which would have sent Portsmouth through to the first non top division final to take on fellow Second Division side Sunderland.\n\nHours after the game, Liverpool manager Graeme Souness was rushed to hospital for an emergency triple heart bypass operation. He was still recovering in hospital eight days later when coach [[Ronnie Moran]] took charge of Liverpool for the FA Cup semi final replay, in which Portsmouth held the Reds to a goalless draw to force a penalty shoot-out which the Reds won.\n\nBy April, everyone at Liverpool appeared to have conceded the league title for this season, and focused their minds on winning the FA Cup. After a five-match winless run in the league, the month ended with a 2-0 home win over Manchester United - a result which handed the title to Leeds United.\n\n===May===\nOn 9 May 1992, Liverpool travelled to [[Wembley Stadium]] for the FA Cup final. Their opponents were [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], the unfashionable Second Division side who had been unremarkable in the league but performed wonders in the FA Cup under interim manager [[Malcolm Crosby]]. There were hopes among Sunderland fans that they could achieve a repeat of their famous [[1973 FA Cup Final|1973]] win over Leeds United and achieve a shock victory, but these were dispelled as goals from Ian Rush and Michael Thomas gave the Reds a 2-0 victory and their fifth FA Cup triumph.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199192 |title=Archived copy |access-date=8

The manager needed heart surgery in April, only to be present at Liverpool won the [[1992 FA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991-92 FA Cup|FA Cup]] the following month. However, it was a disappointing season in the league for Liverpool, whose sixth-place finish was their first outside the top two since 1981.\n\nSouness reshaped his side substantially over the close season. Out went older players including [[Peter Beardsley]], [[David Speedie]] and [[Gary Gillespie]] as well as the young [[Steve Staunton]], and in came \u00a32.9million national record signing [[Dean Saunders]] from [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] along with his Derby colleague, defender [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]]. He also forked out for Rangers midfielder [[Mark Walters]] and blooded in young talent in midfield in the shape of [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Jamie Redknapp]], and just after the season began he drafted in [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1971)|Rob Jones]] from Fourth Division [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], and within a few months the player, barely in his twenties, was representing England at senior level.\n\nOn his way out of [[Anfield]] halfway through the season was midfielder [[Steve McMahon (footballer)|Steve McMahon]] to Manchester City, followed by defender [[Barry Venison]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the end of it. Mid season also saw the arrival of midfielder [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], two and a half years after the player's goal for his former club had denied Liverpool the league title. Thomas ended the season by scoring one of Liverpool's two goals in the FA Cup final against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], the other coming from Ian Rush.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The biggest stories of the summer were the arrival of [[Dean Saunders]], the [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] striker, for a national record fee of \u00a32.9million,<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/406]</ref> and Derby's centre-half [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]] for \u00a32.2million.<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/447]</ref> He bolstered the midfield with a \u00a31.25million move for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] midfielder [[Mark Walters]], bringing the 27-year-old [[Birmingham]] born player back to [[England]] four years after he left [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to move north of the border.<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/437]</ref> Leaving the club were strikers [[David Speedie]] to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/417]</ref> and [[Peter Beardsley]] to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/264]</ref> A surprise sale came when highly promising 22-year-old defender [[Steve Staunton]] moved to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 10 days before the start of the season.<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/418]</ref>\n\n===August===\nLiverpool's centenary season began at [[Anfield]] on 17 August 1991, where they beat [[Oldham Athletic]] (in the top flight for the first time since 1923) 2-1 in the opening First Division game. The next game was a disappointment as they lost 2-1 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at [[Maine Road]], but highly rated 19-year-old midfielder [[Steve McManaman]] managed to score his first goal for the club in this game.\n\nRecord signing [[Dean Saunders]] found the net for the first time on 27 August, scoring the only goal of a 1-0 home win over [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queen's Park Rangers]], Saunders had also missed a penalty in the match at Manchester City.\n\nThe month ended on a high as the Reds triumphed 3-1 over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Merseyside derby]] at Anfield.\n\n===September===\nSeptember saw Liverpool disappoint in the league, losing at [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], drawing with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], and only managing a narrow win at newly promoted relegation favourites [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].\n\nThere was more success on the European front, as Liverpool marked the end of their six-year ban by defeating [[Kuusysi Lahti]] 6-1 in the [[UEFA Cup]] first round first leg at Anfield, with Dean Saunders scoring four goals and [[Ray Houghton]] scoring twice.\n\nOn 23 September, winger [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], a key part in Liverpool's successes since his arrival in 1987, was told that he would be out of action until at least January due to an achilles tendon injury. Although he did make a brief return to the side in the new year, he was soon out of action again.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=barnes+and+liverpool&DateFromDD=01&DateFromMM=Aug&DateFromYY=1991&DateToDD=30&DateToMM=Apr&DateToYY=1992&ResultListMax=200&head=&byline=&sect=&Caption=&edn=&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortField=SDate&Submit1=Search&BackDD=Day&BackMM=Month&BackYY=Year&source=thetimes&SortField=Pub&SortOrder=asc&SortField=EDN&SortOrder=asc&SortField=Page&SortOrder=asc&ST=NS&SortSpec=&ResultMaxDocs=200&Site=ALL&Collection=NI&ResultCount=20&summreqd=yes&indexkey=169E485165195409790&advsrch=0&QueryText=%28barnes+and+liverpool%29+%3CAND%3E+%28PUB%3DBOTH%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D8%2F1%2F1991%29+%3CAND%3E+%28SDate%3C%3D4%2F30%2F1992%29%29&_P=1]</ref>\n\n===October===\nGraeme Souness pulled off one of the biggest transfer bargains of the season when he paid [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] \u00a3300,000 for full-back [[Rob Jones (footballer born 1971)|Rob Jones]]. Jones, who turned 20 a month after arriving at [[Anfield]], broke into the Liverpool first team almost instantly, and was capped by England after just four months of First Division football.\n\nLiverpool's disappointing league form continued throughout October as they were held to draws by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and could only scrape a 1-0 win over struggling [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], though there was better news in the cup competitions as they progressed to the next stage of the UEFA Cup and the League Cup, though they were held to a draw by [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] strugglers [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in the League Cup third round, and were left with an uphill struggle in the UEFA Cup after losing 2-0 to [[Auxerre]] of [[France]] in the second round first leg.\n\n===November===\nNovember began on a high note as Liverpool overturned Auxerre's 2-0 lead in the UEFA Cup to win the second leg 3-0. Their hopes of a quarter-final appearance were boosted at the end of the month when they won the third round first leg 2-0 win over [[FC Tirol Innsbruck|Swarovski Tirol]] in [[Austria]]. The Reds also overcame Port Vale in the League Cup by winning the replay 4-1 at [[Vale Park]].\n\nHowever, there was little improvement in the league as a defeat by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and goalless draws at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] - both struggling at the wrong end of the First Division - left a league title win looking unlikely for this season. Their only league win of the month came when they beat [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] 2-1 at Anfield.\n\n===December===\nDecember began on a humiliating note for the Reds as they suffered a shock League Cup exit at the hands of [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in the fourth round, losing 1-0 to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] underdogs at [[London Road Stadium|London Road]].\n\nThey did, however, progress to the last eight of the UEFA Cup, beating Swarovski Tirol 4-0 in the third round second leg at Anfield with Dean Saunders scoring a hat-trick, taking his European tally to nine goals.\n\nDecember brought little change in Liverpool's league fortunes, however. They went through the month unbeaten in the First Division, managing wins over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] but being held to draws by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] (in a game where 18-year-old midfielder [[Jamie Redknapp]] scored his first Liverpool goal), [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] and last of all [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the Merseyside derby at [[Goodison Park]]. They ended 1991 in sixth place, with their great north western rivals Manchester United top of the pack with a two-point advantage and two games in hand over a resurgent [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=28&Month=Dec&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===January===\nAs the new year dawned, Liverpool began an upturn in league fortunes as they won all four of their games. There was also good news in the [[FA Cup]] as they travelled to [[Gresty Road]] to take on Fourth Division Crewe Alexandra, winning 4-0 and with [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] making an explosive - though ultimately brief - comeback from his absence by scoring a hat-trick.\n\nLiverpool ended the month in third place, just eight points behind leaders Manchester United and six points behind second placed Leeds United, suggesting that they might still be able to win the title.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Jan&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===February===\nLiverpool managed to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals, but not without difficulty. The fourth round visit to Second Division underdogs [[Bristol Rovers]] saw them held to a 1-1 draw, and the replay at Anfield brought a narrow 2-1 win. The fifth round saw them travel to [[Suffolk]] for a clash with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] - Second Division promotion contenders - which ended in a goalless draw. Once again, Liverpool won the Anfield replay, but it was also a narrow victory as they needed extra time to manage a 3-2 win as the score stood at 1-1 with 90 minutes on the clock.\n\nAfter an excellent series of league results in January had raised hopes of a late run to the title, February was a disaster which effectively killed off talk of Liverpool winning the last old First Division title - as the top flight of English football would become the [[FA Premier League]] from the start of the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93 season]]. The month began with a 2-1 home defeat by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], followed by a goalless draw at relegation threatened [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and a 3-0 hammering at fellow strugglers [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. The month ended with another struggling side, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], paying a visit to Anfield, but neither side could find the net and the match ended as a goalless draw. The Reds ended the month fifth in the league, but were now 13 points adrift of leaders Manchester United with 12 games to go. It was now looking as though Liverpool would finish outside the top two for the first time since 1981, as 11 points separated them from second placed Leeds United.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Feb&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===March===\nA 4-1 aggregate defeat by [[Genoa]] of [[Italy]] in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals ended Liverpool's hopes of a glorious return to European football, but their last hope of silverware was kept alive when recently signed midfielder [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] - whose last minute goal against them for former club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] had deprived them of title glory in 1989 - scored the only goal for a quarter-final win over Aston Villa in the [[FA Cup]].\n\nLiverpool's league form improved as they managed wins over West Ham United, Notts County and Tottenham Hotspur, but were defeated by Crystal Palace and Sheffield United, ensuring that they ended the month no higher than fourth in the league. The title was still a mathematical possibility as they trailed leaders Manchester United by 12 points with seven games remaining at the end of the month, but it now appeared a practical impossibility and Liverpool's efforts were now better focused on FA Cup success.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=31&Month=Mar&ssnno=121&teamno=342]</ref>\n\n===April===\nIt had been a long and hard route for Liverpool in the FA Cup, but they finally did get to the FA Cup final. The semi-final draw paired them with Second Division [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], and the game was still deadlock with 90 minutes on the clock. The [[Hampshire]] side went ahead in extra time, and only a late equaliser by [[Ronnie Whelan]] prevented a defeat which would have sent Portsmouth through to the first non top division final to take on fellow Second Division side Sunderland.\n\nHours after the game, Liverpool manager Graeme Souness was rushed to hospital for an emergency triple heart bypass operation. He was still recovering in hospital eight days later when coach [[Ronnie Moran]] took charge of Liverpool for the FA Cup semi final replay, in which Portsmouth held the Reds to a goalless draw to force a penalty shoot-out which the Reds won.\n\nBy April, everyone at Liverpool appeared to have conceded the league title for this season, and focused their minds on winning the FA Cup. After a five-match winless run in the league, the month ended with a 2-0 home win over Manchester United - a result which handed the title to Leeds United.\n\n===May===\nOn 9 May 1992, Liverpool travelled to [[Wembley Stadium]] for the FA Cup final. Their opponents were [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], the unfashionable Second Division side who had been unremarkable in the league but performed wonders in the FA Cup under interim manager [[Malcolm Crosby]]. There were hopes among Sunderland fans that they could achieve a repeat of their famous [[1973 FA Cup Final|1973]] win over Leeds United and achieve a shock victory, but these were dispelled as goals from Ian Rush and Michael Thomas gave the Reds a 2-0 victory and their fifth FA Cup triumph.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199192 |title=Archived copy |access-date=8

By analogy with the biogenetic law of [[recapitulation theory]] he puts forward the hypothesis of the basic law of evolution of mankind, describe the relationship between human development and evolution of the human brain: the evolution of human population actually repeats the evolution of the number of nerve cells in the brain, as a consequence, - evolution of mankind repeats some of the information and functional characteristics of the brain. \nLiving currently on the planet people are heirs of the world's richest cultural heritage in industrial, public, and mentally, - genetic keepers [[memory]] of global intellectual system.

By analogy with the biogenetic law of [[recapitulation theory]] he puts forward the hypothesis of the basic law of evolution of mankind, describe the relationship between human development and evolution of the human brain: the evolution of human population actually repeats the evolution of the number of nerve cells in the brain, as a consequence, - evolution of mankind repeats some of the information and functional characteristics of the brain. \nLiving currently on the planet people are heirs of the world's richest cultural heritage in industrial, public, and mentally, - genetic keepers [[memory]] of global intellectual system. Humanity as a whole displayed objective reality, arising in the process of human interaction. Alexey Eryomin came to the conclusion that superintellect can be realized in the form Global Intelligence, Allworld Mind, World Brain on the planet Earth. \nEryomin A.L. believes that humanity intellectually evolving. Joint global highly intelligent activity of humanity has led in the second half of the twentieth century to the acts, showing the unity and the level of intellectual potential of humanity: organization of the UN, the victory over smallpox, the use of atomic energy, space exploration, organization of the satellite television, satellite navigation systems, etc. \nOpening, further searching and researchs in the twenty-first century formulas of intellect and mathematical foundations of the mind, the translation of \"intellectual\" in the plane of mathematical physiology and physics could, according to Alexey Eryomin, would can to contribute to a number of useful things. Finding Parallels between the formation of the individual and of mankind, as suggested by the researcher, should be continued: it can provide a basis for confidence that the intelligence of humanity will cope with the most unexpected and sometimes dangerous problems and challenges of modernity.\"<ref name=autogenerated5> [http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S.

With the help of a sympathetic guard, he escaped from the [[Yurt|ger]] (yurt) at night by hiding in a river crevice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The escape earned Tem\u00fcjin a reputation.

She heard the voice of Tem\u00fcjin and, recognizing it, she got off the cart and came running towards him. Although it was still night, Lady B\u00f6rte and Qo\u2019aq\u010din both recognized Tem\u00fcjin\u2019s reins and tether and grabbed them.

This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him.

Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him.

Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple.

[[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present.

However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book\n| last       = Morgan\n| first       = David\n| author-link = David Morgan (historian)\n| title       = The Mongols.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants. Genghis Khan had left [[Muqali]], one of his most trusted generals, in command of all Mongol forces in Jin China while he battled the Khwarezmid Empire to the west.\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n[[File:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|right|Genghis Khan (center) at the coronation of his son \u00d6gedei, ''[[Rashid al-Din]]'', early 14th century]]\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire amxxxxong his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each.

The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

([[Lake Baikal]] and ocean were called ''tenggis'' by the Mongols.

Zh\u00e8ng (Chinese: \u6b63) meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier ''-s'', creating \"Jenggis\", which in medieval romanization would be written \"Genghis\".

The name would imply a blacksmith or a man strong like iron.\n\nNo evidence has survived to indicate that Genghis Khan had any exceptional training or reputation as a blacksmith.

This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him.

Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present.

However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed.

Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n[[File:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|right|Genghis Khan (center) at the coronation of his son \u00d6gedei, ''[[Rashid al-Din]]'', early 14th century]]\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops. It was taken through Communist-held territory in [[Yan'an]] some {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years. In 1949, as Communist troops advanced, the Nationalist soldiers moved it another {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of [[Kumbum Monastery]] or Ta'er Shi near [[Xining]], which soon fell under Communist control.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.\n\n== Mongol Empire ==\n{{Main|Mongol Empire}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]-->\n\n=== Politics and economics ===\n{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}\n\n[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]] 1206\u20131294.]]\n\nThe Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

However, review of historical Persian sources does not confirm this.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://worldhistoryconnected.press.uiuc.edu/2.2/br_may.html\n| title=Book Review\n| author=Timothy May\n| publisher=North Georgia College and State University\n| access-date=February 20, 2008\n| url-status=dead\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010095241/http://worldhistoryconnected.press.uiuc.edu/2.2/br_may.html\n| archive-date=October 10, 2007\n| df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]'', Tem\u00fcjin was named after a powerful warrior of the Tatar tribe that his father Yes\u00fcgei had taken prisoner. The name \"Tem\u00fcjin\" is believed to derive from the word ''tem\u00fcr'', Turkic for iron (modern Mongolian: {{lang|mn|\u0442\u04e9\u043c\u04e9\u0440}}, ''t\u00f6m\u00f6r''). The name would imply a blacksmith or a man strong like iron.\n\nNo evidence has survived to indicate that Genghis Khan had any exceptional training or reputation as a blacksmith. But the latter interpretation (a man strong like iron) is supported by the names of Genghis Khan's siblings, Tem\u00fclin and Tem\u00fcge, which are derived from the same root word.\n\n=== Name and spelling variations ===\n<!-- This section is linked from 'Genghis Khan' -->\nGenghis Khan is spelled in a variety of ways in different languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] Chinggis Khaan, English ''Chinghiz'', ''Chinghis'', and ''Chingiz'', {{zh|c=\u6210\u5409\u601d\u6c57|p=Ch\u00e9ngj\u00eds\u012b H\u00e1n}}, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: ''Cengiz Han'', ''\u00c7ingiz Xan'', ''Chingizxon'', ''Sh\u0131n'g'\u0131sxan'', ''\u00c7ingiz Han'' ''\u00c7\u0131\u00f1\u011f\u0131z Xan'', ''\u015e\u0131\u00f1\u011f\u0131s xan'', ''\u00c7i\u00f1\u011fiz Xaan'', ''\u00c7i\u00f1\u011fizhan'', [[Russian languages|Russian]]: \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0445\u0430\u043d (''\u010cingiskhan'') or \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0437-\u0445\u0430\u043d (''\u010cingiz-khan''), etc. Tem\u00fcjin is written in Chinese as {{zh|s=\u94c1\u6728\u771f|t=\u9435\u6728\u771e|p=Ti\u011bm\u00f9zh\u0113n}}.\n\nWhen [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271, he had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or ''Taizu'' ({{zh|\u592a\u7956|T\u00e0iz\u01d4}}). Thus, Genghis Khan is also referred to as ''Yuan Taizu'' (Emperor Taizu of Yuan, {{zh|\u5143\u592a\u7956|Yu\u00e1n T\u00e0iz\u01d4}}) in [[Chinese historiography]].\n\n== Timeline ==\n[[File:GenghisKhanMonumentInHulunbuir.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Hulunbuir]], Inner Mongolia, China]]\n* Probably 1155, 1162, or 1167: Tem\u00fcjin was born in the [[Khentii mountains]].\n* When Tem\u00fcjin was nine, his father [[Yes\u00fckhei]] was poisoned by [[Tatars]], leaving Tem\u00fcjin and his family destitute.\n* c. 1184: Tem\u00fcjin's wife [[B\u00f6rte]] was kidnapped by [[Merkit]]s; he called on blood brother [[Jamukha]] and [[Wang Khan]] for aid, and they rescued her.\n* c. 1185: First son [[Jochi]] was born; leading to doubt about his paternity later among Genghis's children, because he was born shortly after B\u00f6rte's rescue from the Merkits.\n* 1190: Tem\u00fcjin united the Mongol tribes, became leader, and devised code of law [[Yassa]].\n* 1201: Victory over [[Jamukha]]'s [[Jadaran]]s.\n* 1202: Adopted as Wang Khan's heir after successful campaigns against [[Tatars]].\n* 1203: Victory over Wang Khan's [[Keraites]].
