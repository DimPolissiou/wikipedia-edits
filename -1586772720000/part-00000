These neighbours almost completely \"plundered\" the historical events and characters from the land, and there was only debris left for the belated nation. A consequence of this was that first that parts of the \u201cplundered history\u201d were returned, and a second was that an attempt was made to make the debris become a fundamental part of an autochthonous history. This resulted in a long phase of experimenting and revising, during which the influence of non-scientific instances increased. This specific link of politics with historiography in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia... was that this was a case of mutual dependence, i.e. influence between politics and historical science, where historians do not simply have the role of registrars obedient to orders. For their significant political influence, they had to pay the price for the rigidity of the science...

This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans.\" Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian.

For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

Its activists were the students [[Michail Gerdjikov]], Petar Mandjukov and Slavi Merdjanov. They were influenced from the anarcho-nationalism, which emerged in Europe, following the [[French Revolution]], going back at least to [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his involvement with the [[Pan-Slavic]] movement. The anarchists in the so-called \"Geneva group\" of students played key roles in the anti-Ottoman struggles. Nearly all the members who founded the Committee in Geneva were natives from Bulgaria and not from Macedonia. Despite of non-Macedonian descent, they espoused ''Macedonian identity'', emancipated from the ''[[Bulgarian National Revival|pan-Bulgarian national project]]''.<ref>\"We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mi\u0161kova, Central European University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9639776289}}, p. 129.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 Merdjanov moved to the Bulgarian school in Salonika, where he worked as teacher and sparked some of the graduates with this ideas. In 1900 [[Petar Mandzhukov]] also resided in Thessaloniki, where had a contact with the Gemidzii and they were influenced by his anarchist ideas, especially those relating to methods of terrorist struggle. The first meetings of the group took part in 1899 with the purpose of forming a revolutionary terrorist group with aim of changing international public opinion in the matter of the freedom of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[East Thrace|Adrianople Thrace]] through urging the social conscience of the oppressed.<ref>\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442 50-\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u041a\u0440\u0443\u043c \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u0420\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440, 2000, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 21.</ref> The group is found in published works with several names: \"The boatmen of Thessaloniki\", the \"Crew\",<ref>James Sotros, ''The Greek Speaking Anarchist and Revolutionary Movement'', p. 191</ref> or the \"Gemitzides\", form of the Turkish word for \"boatman\". At their start, they had a different name, the \"Troublemakers\", ''g\u00fcr\u00fclt\u00fcc\u00fc''.<ref>Megas G. The Boatmen of Thesalloniki. page 52</ref> The name \"boatmen\" was due to \"leaving behind the everyday life and the limits of law and sail with a boat in the free and wild seas of lawlessness.\"<ref>Megas G., ''The Boatmen of Thesalloniki'', p. 52</ref>\n\n== Attack plans and actions in Istanbul ==\n\nAt first the anarchists started to make plans for a bomb attack in [[Istanbul]]. In the summer of 1899, under the leadership of [[Slavi Merdjanov]] the group planned the assassination of the Sultan. Merdzjanov, [[Petar Sokolov]] and their friend, the anarchist [[Petar Mandjukov]],  approached [[Boris Sarafov]], the leader of [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]], and asked him for funds to finance large-scale terrorist activities in the main towns of European Turkey. He promised to provide money, and the three left for Istanbul, where after much discussion, they decided to assassinate the Sultan. In December of the same year Merdjanov was connected by the secretary of [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] [[Dimitar Lyapov]] with local Armenian revolutionaries. Here they established that even with the help of the Armenians it was impossible to do it. Quite early on, they decided that the effect of the explosion would be greater if there were parallel actions in other towns, and they consulted with [[Jordan Popjordanov]], a member of a small terrorist group in Salonika, who agreed to blow up the Salonika branch of the Ottoman Bank. He enlisted the aid of a number of close friends. Salonika terrorists were very young men, mostly from [[Veles (city)|Veles]], pupils in the Bulgarian High School. The Salonika terrorist group called itself \"the Gemidzhi\". They planned to begin by blowing up the central offices of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Salonika and Istanbul. During 1900 Merdjanov arrived again in Istanbul to discuss the plan with the Armenians, and afterward the terrorists started to work, digging tunnels in both places. On 18 September 1900 the Ottoman police apprehended a member of a group, who was carrying the explosives and later the whole group was arrested, including  Merdjanov, Sokolov and [[Pavel Shatev]]. The core was hastily disbanded for security and only Pingov stayed in Thessaloniki to prepare future activity. In 1901 the prisoners were deported \u03c4\u03bf Bulgaria, after pressure from the Bulgarian government. \n\n== Attack plans and actions in Adrianople ==\n\nMerdzjanov and Sokolov went to Sofia and began to think up new ideas, one of which was to hold up the [[Orient Express]] on Turkish territory near [[Adrianople]], and to gain possession of the mail in order to finance future actions. In pursuit of this plan, they went to the Adrianople area in July 1901, with a cheta consisting of ten men, equipped with the help of [[Pavel Genadiev]], the [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]]'s representative in [[Plovdiv]]. The cheta managed to place a large quantity of dynamite on the railway line, but something went wrong, and the train passed undamaged. After this failure, they kidnapped the son of a rich Turkish landowner, but they were soon discovered and surrounded by large Turkish forces. In a battle which lasted several hours, most of the chetnitsi were killed or seriously wounded. Sokolov was among the dead, and Merdzjanov was captured alive, together with a Bulgarian from [[Lozengrad]], and two Armenians. The captives were taken to Adrianople, where, in November 1901, all four were publicly hanged. The Gemidzhii were ready for action again in 1902, but the seizure in [[Dedeagach]] of dynamite, arranged by [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]]'s leader [[Boris Sarafov]], forced the group to abandon planned attacks of [[Austrian post offices in the Ottoman Empire|Austrian post office]] in [[Adrianople]], and to restrict its activity. Afterwards the members of the group went to Thessaloniki and continued to plan their new bombings.\n\n== Bombings in Thessaloniki ==\n{{multiple image<!-- begin stack of images, scroll down for section text -->\n|direction = vertical | width = 220\n|image1 = Ottoman bank thessaloniki.jpg| caption1 = [[Ottoman Bank]] after blow up, April 1903.\n|image2 = Guadalkivir solun.jpg| caption2 = The burning French ship \"Guadalquivir\".\n}}\nOn the 28 April 1903, a member of the group, [[Pavel Shatev]], used dynamite to blow up the French ship \"Guadalquivir\" which was leaving the Thessaloniki harbour. The bomber left the ship together with the other passengers, but was caught later by the Turkish police at the Skopje train station. The same night, other group bombers: Dimitar Mechev, Iliya Trachkov, and Milan Arsov, struck the railway between Thessaloniki and Istanbul, causing damage to the locomotive and some of the cars of a passing train without wounding any passengers.\n\nThe next day, the signal to begin the large raid in Thessaloniki was given by Kostadin Kirkov who used explosives to shut off the electricity and water supply systems of the city. Jordan Popjordanov (Orceto) blew up the building of an Ottoman Bank office, under which the \"gemidzhii\" had previously dug a tunnel. Milan Arsov threw bombs in the \"Alhambra\" Caf\u00e9. The same night, Kostadin Kirkov, Iliya Bogdanov and Vladimir Pingov detonated bombs in different parts of the city. Dimitar Mechev and Iliya Truchkov failed to blast the reservoir of a gas-producing plant. They were later killed in their quarters during a shoot-out with army and gendarmerie forces, against which Mechev and Trachkov used more than 60 bombs.\n\n[[Jordan Popjordanov]] was killed on April 30. In May, Kostadin Kirkov was killed while trying to blow up a postal office. Right before being caught, Cvetko Traikov, whose mission was to kill the local governor, killed himself by setting off a bomb and then sitting on it.\n\n== Related attacks in Burgas and Kuleliburgaz==\nContinuation of the Thessaloniki bombings were the bombing in the same year of the passenger train near the railway station [[Kuleliburgaz]] led by [[Mihail Gerdzhikov]] and the bombing campaign of the passenger ship \"[[Vaskapu (ship)|Vaskapu]]\" in the [[Burgas Bay]] led by Anton Prudkin, both organized by anarchists close to the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] (IMARO).<ref>[http://www.krumblagov.com/fifty/3.php \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u041a\u0440\u0443\u043c. 50-\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, 3. \u0415\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0437\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430 \"\u0412\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\"]</ref> The daily express from Budapest to Istanbul was blown up near Kuleliburgaz on August 28.

The second terrorist act on the board of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] river- and sea- steamer Vaskapu occurred on 2 Sept.

Due to the premature explosion of \"Vaskapu\", the plan failed.\n[[File:Pavel Shatev Standing.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Pavel Shatev, the only survivor from the group was jailed in Communist Yugoslavia and died into home custody.]]\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn the wake of the attacks, [[martial law]] was declared in the city. As a response the Turkish Army and \"[[bashibozouk]]s\" [[massacre]]d many innocent [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]] citizens in Thessaloniki to purge the province of the Bulgarian \"threat\", and later in [[Bitola]]. Pavel Shatev, Marko Boshnakov, Georgi Bogdanov and Milan Arsov were arrested and sentenced by a court martial to a penal colony in [[Fezzan]]. Also members of the Central Committee of [[IMORO]], including [[Ivan Garvanov]], D. Mirchev, and J. Kondov were incarcerated.\n\nIn Libya, Boshnakov died from [[malaria]] on February 14, 1908 and Arsov from exhaustion on June 8, the same year. After July 30, 1908, because of the victory of the movement of the [[Young Turks]], Ottoman amnesty was given to the two remaining \"Boatmen\".

These neighbours almost completely \"plundered\" the historical events and characters from the land, and there was only debris left for the belated nation. A consequence of this was that first that parts of the \u201cplundered history\u201d were returned, and a second was that an attempt was made to make the debris become a fundamental part of an autochthonous history. This resulted in a long phase of experimenting and revising, during which the influence of non-scientific instances increased. This specific link of politics with historiography in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia... was that this was a case of mutual dependence, i.e. influence between politics and historical science, where historians do not simply have the role of registrars obedient to orders.

Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans.\" Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

Its activists were the students [[Michail Gerdjikov]], Petar Mandjukov and Slavi Merdjanov. They were influenced from the anarcho-nationalism, which emerged in Europe, following the [[French Revolution]], going back at least to [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his involvement with the [[Pan-Slavic]] movement. The anarchists in the so-called \"Geneva group\" of students played key roles in the anti-Ottoman struggles. Nearly all the members who founded the Committee in Geneva were natives from Bulgaria and not from Macedonia. Despite of non-Macedonian descent, they espoused ''Macedonian identity'', emancipated from the ''[[Bulgarian National Revival|pan-Bulgarian national project]]''.<ref>\"We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mi\u0161kova, Central European University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9639776289}}, p. 129.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 Merdjanov moved to the Bulgarian school in Salonika, where he worked as teacher and sparked some of the graduates with this ideas. In 1900 [[Petar Mandzhukov]] also resided in Thessaloniki, where had a contact with the Gemidzii and they were influenced by his anarchist ideas, especially those relating to methods of terrorist struggle. The first meetings of the group took part in 1899 with the purpose of forming a revolutionary terrorist group with aim of changing international public opinion in the matter of the freedom of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[East Thrace|Adrianople Thrace]] through urging the social conscience of the oppressed.<ref>\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442 50-\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u041a\u0440\u0443\u043c \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u0420\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440, 2000, \u0441\u0442\u0440. 21.</ref> The group is found in published works with several names: \"The boatmen of Thessaloniki\", the \"Crew\",<ref>James Sotros, ''The Greek Speaking Anarchist and Revolutionary Movement'', p. 191</ref> or the \"Gemitzides\", form of the Turkish word for \"boatman\".

In the summer of 1899, under the leadership of [[Slavi Merdjanov]] the group planned the assassination of the Sultan. Merdzjanov, [[Petar Sokolov]] and their friend, the anarchist [[Petar Mandjukov]],  approached [[Boris Sarafov]], the leader of [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee]], and asked him for funds to finance large-scale terrorist activities in the main towns of European Turkey. He promised to provide money, and the three left for Istanbul, where after much discussion, they decided to assassinate the Sultan. In December of the same year Merdjanov was connected by the secretary of [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] [[Dimitar Lyapov]] with local Armenian revolutionaries. Here they established that even with the help of the Armenians it was impossible to do it. Quite early on, they decided that the effect of the explosion would be greater if there were parallel actions in other towns, and they consulted with [[Jordan Popjordanov]], a member of a small terrorist group in Salonika, who agreed to blow up the Salonika branch of the Ottoman Bank. He enlisted the aid of a number of close friends. Salonika terrorists were very young men, mostly from [[Veles (city)|Veles]], pupils in the Bulgarian High School. The Salonika terrorist group called itself \"the Gemidzhi\". They planned to begin by blowing up the central offices of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Salonika and Istanbul. During 1900 Merdjanov arrived again in Istanbul to discuss the plan with the Armenians, and afterward the terrorists started to work, digging tunnels in both places. On 18 September 1900 the Ottoman police apprehended a member of a group, who was carrying the explosives and later the whole group was arrested, including  Merdjanov, Sokolov and [[Pavel Shatev]]. The core was hastily disbanded for security and only Pingov stayed in Thessaloniki to prepare future activity. In 1901 the prisoners were deported \u03c4\u03bf Bulgaria, after pressure from the Bulgarian government. \n\n== Attack plans and actions in Adrianople ==\n\nMerdzjanov and Sokolov went to Sofia and began to think up new ideas, one of which was to hold up the [[Orient Express]] on Turkish territory near [[Adrianople]], and to gain possession of the mail in order to finance future actions. In pursuit of this plan, they went to the Adrianople area in July 1901, with a cheta consisting of ten men, equipped with the help of [[Pavel Genadiev]], the [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]]'s representative in [[Plovdiv]]. The cheta managed to place a large quantity of dynamite on the railway line, but something went wrong, and the train passed undamaged. After this failure, they kidnapped the son of a rich Turkish landowner, but they were soon discovered and surrounded by large Turkish forces. In a battle which lasted several hours, most of the chetnitsi were killed or seriously wounded. Sokolov was among the dead, and Merdzjanov was captured alive, together with a Bulgarian from [[Lozengrad]], and two Armenians. The captives were taken to Adrianople, where, in November 1901, all four were publicly hanged. The Gemidzhii were ready for action again in 1902, but the seizure in [[Dedeagach]] of dynamite, arranged by [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]]'s leader [[Boris Sarafov]], forced the group to abandon planned attacks of [[Austrian post offices in the Ottoman Empire|Austrian post office]] in [[Adrianople]], and to restrict its activity. Afterwards the members of the group went to Thessaloniki and continued to plan their new bombings.\n\n== Bombings in Thessaloniki ==\n{{multiple image<!-- begin stack of images, scroll down for section text -->\n|direction = vertical | width = 220\n|image1 = Ottoman bank thessaloniki.jpg| caption1 = [[Ottoman Bank]] after blow up, April 1903.\n|image2 = Guadalkivir solun.jpg| caption2 = The burning French ship \"Guadalquivir\".\n}}\nOn the 28 April 1903, a member of the group, [[Pavel Shatev]], used dynamite to blow up the French ship \"Guadalquivir\" which was leaving the Thessaloniki harbour. The bomber left the ship together with the other passengers, but was caught later by the Turkish police at the Skopje train station. The same night, other group bombers: Dimitar Mechev, Iliya Trachkov, and Milan Arsov, struck the railway between Thessaloniki and Istanbul, causing damage to the locomotive and some of the cars of a passing train without wounding any passengers.\n\nThe next day, the signal to begin the large raid in Thessaloniki was given by Kostadin Kirkov who used explosives to shut off the electricity and water supply systems of the city. Jordan Popjordanov (Orceto) blew up the building of an Ottoman Bank office, under which the \"gemidzhii\" had previously dug a tunnel. Milan Arsov threw bombs in the \"Alhambra\" Caf\u00e9. The same night, Kostadin Kirkov, Iliya Bogdanov and Vladimir Pingov detonated bombs in different parts of the city. Dimitar Mechev and Iliya Truchkov failed to blast the reservoir of a gas-producing plant. They were later killed in their quarters during a shoot-out with army and gendarmerie forces, against which Mechev and Trachkov used more than 60 bombs.\n\n[[Jordan Popjordanov]] was killed on April 30. In May, Kostadin Kirkov was killed while trying to blow up a postal office. Right before being caught, Cvetko Traikov, whose mission was to kill the local governor, killed himself by setting off a bomb and then sitting on it.\n\n== Related attacks in Burgas and Kuleliburgaz==\nContinuation of the Thessaloniki bombings were the bombing in the same year of the passenger train near the railway station [[Kuleliburgaz]] led by [[Mihail Gerdzhikov]] and the bombing campaign of the passenger ship \"[[Vaskapu (ship)|Vaskapu]]\" in the [[Burgas Bay]] led by Anton Prudkin, both organized by anarchists close to the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] (IMARO).<ref>[http://www.krumblagov.com/fifty/3.php \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u041a\u0440\u0443\u043c. 50-\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, 3. \u0415\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0437\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430 \"\u0412\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\"]</ref> The daily express from Budapest to Istanbul was blown up near Kuleliburgaz on August 28.

It was planned to attack the port of Istanbul, with four ships being exploded there on 9 September: besides \"Vaskapu\",  these were the Austro-Hungarian \"Apollo\", the German \"Tenedos\" and the French \"Felix Fressinet\". Due to the premature explosion of \"Vaskapu\", the plan failed.\n[[File:Pavel Shatev Standing.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Pavel Shatev, the only survivor from the group was jailed in Communist Yugoslavia and died into home custody.]]\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn the wake of the attacks, [[martial law]] was declared in the city. As a response the Turkish Army and \"[[bashibozouk]]s\" [[massacre]]d many innocent [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]] citizens in Thessaloniki to purge the province of the Bulgarian \"threat\", and later in [[Bitola]]. Pavel Shatev, Marko Boshnakov, Georgi Bogdanov and Milan Arsov were arrested and sentenced by a court martial to a penal colony in [[Fezzan]].
