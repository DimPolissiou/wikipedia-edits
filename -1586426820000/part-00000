Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at [[Grossglockner]] in Austria, the exceptionally steep [[Monte Zoncolan]], and a tall and steep peak near the [[Fascia Valley]] in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the [[Nevegal]]. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.\n\nIn the third stage, {{ct|LEO|2011}} rider [[Wouter Weylandt]] crashed coming down the [[Passo del Bocco]], near the town of [[Mezzanego]], suffering [[catastrophic injury]]. Despite substantial resuscitation efforts, he was established to have died on the spot. The fourth stage was not competitively raced; instead, it was run as a cycling procession. On the second rest day, [[Xavier Tond\u00f3]], a member of {{ct|MOV|2011}}, was killed in an accident at his home. Although he was not a participant, his death caused his teammates and other members of the peloton to pay tribute to him in the subsequent stages.\n\nStrong overall favorite [[Alberto Contador]] was the race's original winner, in what constituted his second Giro championship. His winning margin ahead of second-placed [[Michele Scarponi]] was over six minutes. He also won the points competition as the most consistent high finisher, also with a substantial lead over Scarponi in second place, and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] completed the podium. In the other sub-classifications, [[Stefano Garzelli]] won the mountains competition and [[Roman Kreuziger]] finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification; he finished the race fifth overall.\n\nIn February 2012, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] decided that Contador, following his [[2010 Tour de France#Alberto Contador|positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France]], lost his results since that event. He was therefore stripped of the 2011 Giro title, and Scarponi became the new victor of the race, and the winner of the points classification.<ref name=\"cascontador\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cas-sanction-contador-with-two-year-ban-in-clenbuterol-case |title=CAS sanctions Contador with two-year ban in clenbutorol case |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2012 |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |work=Cyclingnews |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707175038/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cas-sanction-contador-with-two-year-ban-in-clenbuterol-case |archivedate=7 July 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 2011 Giro d'Italia}}\nAll 18 [[UCI ProTeam]]s were invited automatically and obligated to attend.

The more notable was stage 14, which had been hyped as the d\u00e9but of the [[Monte Crostis]] in the Giro d'Italia. Commissaires from the UCI mandated it be removed the night before stage 14 was run. The Crostis is not a well-maintained pass, and Giro officials had set out a detailed protocol whereby team cars would not follow the race up or down the mountain, and only motorbikes offering wheel changes would be present with the riders. Team managers expressed concern that they would not fully be able to fulfill their duties if not present with the riders like normal, and this was given as the basis of the UCI's decision. They held that Giro organizers had sufficiently ensured rider safety on the course, but the necessary protocols did not protect the sporting aspect of the race. Thus, the Crostis was eliminated, and the stage was reduced in length from its originally planned length of {{convert|210|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Stephen Farrand \n |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/crostis-climb-cut-from-giro-ditalia \n |title=Crostis climb cut from Giro d'Italia \n |date=20 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling News \n |publisher=Future Publishing Limited \n |accessdate=20 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602145624/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/crostis-climb-cut-from-giro-ditalia\n |archivedate=2 June 2013\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> The second-category Tualis climb was added to the route for the day to offset the loss of the Crostis. However, protests from spectators disappointed by the removal of the Crostis part of the route, including many who had volunteered for works to make parts of that road safe, led to the cancellation of the Tualis climb. The route was diverted while the stage was in progress to avoid a small village at the foot of the Tualis where protesters had gathered.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Qu\u00e9net \n |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/nibali-contador-didnt-respect-me \n |title=Nibali: Contador didn\u2019t respect me \n |date=21 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling News \n |publisher=Future Publishing Limited \n |accessdate=24 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714022438/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/nibali-contador-didnt-respect-me\n |archivedate=14 July 2013\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Therefore, the length of the stage was shortened to {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=on}}. The Giro's last stage, an individual time trial in Milan, was also shortened. The course was shortened by {{convert|5.5|km|1|abbr=on}} four days before the stage took place, due to a special election taking place in Milan the same day as the stage. City officials expected high voter turnout and did not want the city center tied up by the race all day, so the revised route began at the outskirts of Milan instead of its center. It still ended, per its original design, at the [[Duomo di Milano]].<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Gregor Brown \n |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-changes-again-final-milan-time-trial-shortened-51719 \n |title=Stage 21 Preview \n |date=25 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling Weekly \n |publisher=IPC Media Limited \n |accessdate=31 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921060030/http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-changes-again-final-milan-time-trial-shortened-51719\n |archivedate=21 September 2015\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of first-hand criticism from riders following the race that the route was excessively difficult and dangerous,<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Ben Atkins \n |url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/8598/Giro-dItalia-The-hardest-race-I-ever-rode-says-Fumiyuki-Beppu.aspx \n |title=Giro d'Italia: \"The hardest race I ever rode,\" says Fumiyuki Beppu \n |date=29 May 2011 \n |work=VeloNation \n |publisher=VeloNation LLC \n |accessdate=13 July 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210823/http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/8598/Giro-dItalia-The-hardest-race-I-ever-rode-says-Fumiyuki-Beppu.aspx\n |archivedate=3 March 2016\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |author=[[Michael Barry (cyclist)|Michael Barry]] \n |url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2011/06/news/michael-barry-diary-organizers-%E2%80%94-and-riders-%E2%80%94-need-to-take-responsibility-for-race-safety_178326 \n |title=Organizers \u2013 and riders \u2013 need to take responsibility for race safety \n |date=13 June 2011 \n |work=VeloNews \n |publisher=Competitor Group, Inc. \n |accessdate=13 July 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729202916/http://velonews.competitor.com/2011/06/news/michael-barry-diary-organizers-%E2%80%94-and-riders-%E2%80%94-need-to-take-responsibility-for-race-safety_178326\n |archivedate=29 July 2013\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Zomegnan remained staunch in his defense of the route.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Stephen Farrand\n|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/zomegnan-defends-giro-ditalia-and-contador\n|title=Zomegnan defends Giro d'Italia and Contador\n|date=30 May 2011\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=13 July 2011\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723025417/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/zomegnan-defends-giro-ditalia-and-contador| archivedate= 23 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Stage\n!Date\n!Course\n!Distance\n!colspan=\"2\"|Type\n!Winner\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|1\n|align=right|7 May || [[Venaria Reale]] to [[Turin]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|19.3|km|1|abbr=on}}||[[File:Time Trial.svg|20px|link=]]||[[Team time trial]]||{{ct|THR|2011}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|align=right|8 May ||[[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] to [[Parma]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|244|km|0|abbr=on}} ||[[Image:Plainstage.svg|22px]]||Flat stage ||{{flagathlete|[[Alessandro Petacchi]]|ITA}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|align=right|9 May || [[Reggio Emilia]] to [[Rapallo]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|173|km|0|abbr=on}} ||[[Image:Plainstage.svg|22px]]||Flat stage ||{{flagathlete|[[\u00c1ngel Vicioso]]|ESP}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|align=right|10 May || [[Genova|Quarto dei Mille]] to [[Livorno]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|216|km|0|abbr=on}} ||[[Image:Mediummountainstage.svg]]||Medium mountain stage || ''Stage neutralised''<ref>Stage 4 was neutralised after Wouter Weylandt's death in the previous day's race.

It was on this day that strong overall favorite [[Alberto Contador]] first seized control of the race. Just after {{ct|AND|2011}}'s [[Jos\u00e9 Rujano]] attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled mightily to hold Contador's wheel and no one else came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Les Clarke \n |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/giro-ditalia-2011/stage-9/results \n |title=Contador climbs to stage victory and into overall lead \n |date=15 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling News \n |publisher=Future Publishing Limited \n |accessdate=16 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302084859/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/giro-ditalia-2011/stage-9/results\n |archivedate=2 March 2014\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> In his five previous Grand Tour wins, Contador had never lost the race lead after taking it, but he had also never taken it so early on in the race. As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead for too many days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey.

The win earned 25&nbsp;points, second place earned 20&nbsp;points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th.

The ''Cima Coppi'', the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.<ref name=\"demystified\" />\n\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1986 were eligible.<ref name=\"demystified\" />\n\nThere were also three classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20&nbsp;placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team;<ref name=\"demystified\" /> and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements.\n\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run, and shows to whom each jersey would have been awarded each day had [[Alberto Contador]] been removed from the standings as the race was ongoing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:1%;\"| Stage\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Winner\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[General classification in the Giro d'Italia|General classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey pink.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[Points classification in the Giro d'Italia|Points classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey red.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[Mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia|Mountains classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey green.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[Young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|Young rider classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey white.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n|-\n!

classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the ''Traguardo Volante'', or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> It was won by [[Jan Bakelants]] of the {{ct|OLO|2011|nolink=yes}} team.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" />\n\nOther awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> Original general classification winner [[Alberto Contador]] won this award at the race's conclusion; upon his disqualification it passed to mountains category winner [[Stefano Garzelli]].<ref name=\"finalstandings\" /> The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> It was originally won, like the closely associated points classification, by Contador, and passed to [[Jos\u00e9 Rujano]] when the Spaniard's results were stripped.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" /> Additionally, the ''Trofeo Fuga Pinarello'' rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> {{ct|RSH|2011|nolink=yes}}'s [[Yaroslav Popovych]] was first in this competition.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" /> Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> Six different teams&nbsp;\u2013 {{ct|LIQ|2011}}, {{ct|AND|2011}}, {{ct|THR|2011}}, {{ct|QST|2011}}, {{ct|BMC|2011}}, and {{ct|CSF|2011}}&nbsp;\u2013 avoided incurring penalties over the course of the race, and so shared in winning the Fair Play classification.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" />\n\n===World Rankings points===\nThe Giro was one of 27&nbsp;events throughout the season that contributed points towards the [[2011 UCI World Tour]]. Points were awarded to the top 20&nbsp;finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTU2MzU&ObjTypeCode=FILE&type=FILE&id=NDk5MDY&LangId=1 \n |title=Points scale \u2013 UCI World Ranking \n |publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] \n |accessdate=17 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603221313/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTU2MzU&ObjTypeCode=FILE&type=FILE&id=NDk5MDY&LangId=1 \n |archivedate=3 June 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\nIn early 2012, the points earned by Contador for overall placing were redistributed, and those gained for stage finishes were removed.

The race started on 7 May with a [[team time trial]] in [[Turin]] to celebrate the 150th anniversary of [[Italian unification]], when the city served as the first capital of the single state.<ref>{{cite web |title=2011 Giro d'Italia to start in Turin with team time trial|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/493427/2011-giro-d-italia-to-start-in-turin-with-team-time-trial.html|date=29 July 2010|publisher=Cycling Weekly |accessdate=25 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831034307/http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/493427/2011-giro-d-italia-to-start-in-turin-with-team-time-trial.html| archivedate= 31 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe route was one of the most difficult in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply too hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at [[Grossglockner]] in Austria, the exceptionally steep [[Monte Zoncolan]], and a tall and steep peak near the [[Fascia Valley]] in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the [[Nevegal]]. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.\n\nIn the third stage, {{ct|LEO|2011}} rider [[Wouter Weylandt]] crashed coming down the [[Passo del Bocco]], near the town of [[Mezzanego]], suffering [[catastrophic injury]]. Despite substantial resuscitation efforts, he was established to have died on the spot. The fourth stage was not competitively raced; instead, it was run as a cycling procession. On the second rest day, [[Xavier Tond\u00f3]], a member of {{ct|MOV|2011}}, was killed in an accident at his home. Although he was not a participant, his death caused his teammates and other members of the peloton to pay tribute to him in the subsequent stages.\n\nStrong overall favorite [[Alberto Contador]] was the race's original winner, in what constituted his second Giro championship. His winning margin ahead of second-placed [[Michele Scarponi]] was over six minutes. He also won the points competition as the most consistent high finisher, also with a substantial lead over Scarponi in second place, and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] completed the podium. In the other sub-classifications, [[Stefano Garzelli]] won the mountains competition and [[Roman Kreuziger]] finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification; he finished the race fifth overall.\n\nIn February 2012, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] decided that Contador, following his [[2010 Tour de France#Alberto Contador|positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France]], lost his results since that event. He was therefore stripped of the 2011 Giro title, and Scarponi became the new victor of the race, and the winner of the points classification.<ref name=\"cascontador\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cas-sanction-contador-with-two-year-ban-in-clenbuterol-case |title=CAS sanctions Contador with two-year ban in clenbutorol case |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2012 |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |work=Cyclingnews |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707175038/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cas-sanction-contador-with-two-year-ban-in-clenbuterol-case |archivedate=7 July 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 2011 Giro d'Italia}}\nAll 18 [[UCI ProTeam]]s were invited automatically and obligated to attend.

The more notable was stage 14, which had been hyped as the d\u00e9but of the [[Monte Crostis]] in the Giro d'Italia. Commissaires from the UCI mandated it be removed the night before stage 14 was run. The Crostis is not a well-maintained pass, and Giro officials had set out a detailed protocol whereby team cars would not follow the race up or down the mountain, and only motorbikes offering wheel changes would be present with the riders. Team managers expressed concern that they would not fully be able to fulfill their duties if not present with the riders like normal, and this was given as the basis of the UCI's decision. They held that Giro organizers had sufficiently ensured rider safety on the course, but the necessary protocols did not protect the sporting aspect of the race. Thus, the Crostis was eliminated, and the stage was reduced in length from its originally planned length of {{convert|210|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Stephen Farrand \n |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/crostis-climb-cut-from-giro-ditalia \n |title=Crostis climb cut from Giro d'Italia \n |date=20 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling News \n |publisher=Future Publishing Limited \n |accessdate=20 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602145624/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/crostis-climb-cut-from-giro-ditalia\n |archivedate=2 June 2013\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> The second-category Tualis climb was added to the route for the day to offset the loss of the Crostis. However, protests from spectators disappointed by the removal of the Crostis part of the route, including many who had volunteered for works to make parts of that road safe, led to the cancellation of the Tualis climb. The route was diverted while the stage was in progress to avoid a small village at the foot of the Tualis where protesters had gathered.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Qu\u00e9net \n |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/nibali-contador-didnt-respect-me \n |title=Nibali: Contador didn\u2019t respect me \n |date=21 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling News \n |publisher=Future Publishing Limited \n |accessdate=24 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714022438/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/nibali-contador-didnt-respect-me\n |archivedate=14 July 2013\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Therefore, the length of the stage was shortened to {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=on}}. The Giro's last stage, an individual time trial in Milan, was also shortened. The course was shortened by {{convert|5.5|km|1|abbr=on}} four days before the stage took place, due to a special election taking place in Milan the same day as the stage. City officials expected high voter turnout and did not want the city center tied up by the race all day, so the revised route began at the outskirts of Milan instead of its center. It still ended, per its original design, at the [[Duomo di Milano]].<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Gregor Brown \n |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-changes-again-final-milan-time-trial-shortened-51719 \n |title=Stage 21 Preview \n |date=25 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling Weekly \n |publisher=IPC Media Limited \n |accessdate=31 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921060030/http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-changes-again-final-milan-time-trial-shortened-51719\n |archivedate=21 September 2015\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of first-hand criticism from riders following the race that the route was excessively difficult and dangerous,<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Ben Atkins \n |url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/8598/Giro-dItalia-The-hardest-race-I-ever-rode-says-Fumiyuki-Beppu.aspx \n |title=Giro d'Italia: \"The hardest race I ever rode,\" says Fumiyuki Beppu \n |date=29 May 2011 \n |work=VeloNation \n |publisher=VeloNation LLC \n |accessdate=13 July 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210823/http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/8598/Giro-dItalia-The-hardest-race-I-ever-rode-says-Fumiyuki-Beppu.aspx\n |archivedate=3 March 2016\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |author=[[Michael Barry (cyclist)|Michael Barry]] \n |url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2011/06/news/michael-barry-diary-organizers-%E2%80%94-and-riders-%E2%80%94-need-to-take-responsibility-for-race-safety_178326 \n |title=Organizers \u2013 and riders \u2013 need to take responsibility for race safety \n |date=13 June 2011 \n |work=VeloNews \n |publisher=Competitor Group, Inc. \n |accessdate=13 July 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729202916/http://velonews.competitor.com/2011/06/news/michael-barry-diary-organizers-%E2%80%94-and-riders-%E2%80%94-need-to-take-responsibility-for-race-safety_178326\n |archivedate=29 July 2013\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Zomegnan remained staunch in his defense of the route.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Stephen Farrand\n|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/zomegnan-defends-giro-ditalia-and-contador\n|title=Zomegnan defends Giro d'Italia and Contador\n|date=30 May 2011\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=13 July 2011\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723025417/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/zomegnan-defends-giro-ditalia-and-contador| archivedate= 23 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Stage\n!Date\n!Course\n!Distance\n!colspan=\"2\"|Type\n!Winner\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|1\n|align=right|7 May || [[Venaria Reale]] to [[Turin]]|| style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|19.3|km|1|abbr=on}}||[[File:Time Trial.svg|20px|link=]]||[[Team time trial]]||{{ct|THR|2011}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|align=right|8 May ||[[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] to [[Parma]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|244|km|0|abbr=on}} ||[[Image:Plainstage.svg|22px]]||Flat stage ||{{flagathlete|[[Alessandro Petacchi]]|ITA}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|align=right|9 May || [[Reggio Emilia]] to [[Rapallo]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|173|km|0|abbr=on}} ||[[Image:Plainstage.svg|22px]]||Flat stage ||{{flagathlete|[[\u00c1ngel Vicioso]]|ESP}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|align=right|10 May || [[Genova|Quarto dei Mille]] to [[Livorno]] || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{convert|216|km|0|abbr=on}} ||[[Image:Mediummountainstage.svg]]||Medium mountain stage || ''Stage neutralised''<ref>Stage 4 was neutralised after Wouter Weylandt's death in the previous day's race.

It was on this day that strong overall favorite [[Alberto Contador]] first seized control of the race. Just after {{ct|AND|2011}}'s [[Jos\u00e9 Rujano]] attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled mightily to hold Contador's wheel and no one else came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Les Clarke \n |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/giro-ditalia-2011/stage-9/results \n |title=Contador climbs to stage victory and into overall lead \n |date=15 May 2011 \n |work=Cycling News \n |publisher=Future Publishing Limited \n |accessdate=16 May 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302084859/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/giro-ditalia-2011/stage-9/results\n |archivedate=2 March 2014\n |url-status=live\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> In his five previous Grand Tour wins, Contador had never lost the race lead after taking it, but he had also never taken it so early on in the race. As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead for too many days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey.

The win earned 25&nbsp;points, second place earned 20&nbsp;points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th.

The ''Cima Coppi'', the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.<ref name=\"demystified\" />\n\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1986 were eligible.<ref name=\"demystified\" />\n\nThere were also three classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20&nbsp;placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team;<ref name=\"demystified\" /> and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements.\n\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run, and shows to whom each jersey would have been awarded each day had [[Alberto Contador]] been removed from the standings as the race was ongoing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:smaller;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:1%;\"| Stage\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Winner\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[General classification in the Giro d'Italia|General classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey pink.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[Points classification in the Giro d'Italia|Points classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey red.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[Mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia|Mountains classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey green.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n!  style=\"background:#efefef; width:15%;\"|[[Young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|Young rider classification]]<br>[[Image:Jersey white.svg|25px|link=|alt=]]\n|-\n!

classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the ''Traguardo Volante'', or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> It was won by [[Jan Bakelants]] of the {{ct|OLO|2011|nolink=yes}} team.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" />\n\nOther awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> Original general classification winner [[Alberto Contador]] won this award at the race's conclusion; upon his disqualification it passed to mountains category winner [[Stefano Garzelli]].<ref name=\"finalstandings\" /> The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> It was originally won, like the closely associated points classification, by Contador, and passed to [[Jos\u00e9 Rujano]] when the Spaniard's results were stripped.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" /> Additionally, the ''Trofeo Fuga Pinarello'' rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> {{ct|RSH|2011|nolink=yes}}'s [[Yaroslav Popovych]] was first in this competition.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" /> Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements.<ref name=\"demystified\" /> Six different teams&nbsp;\u2013 {{ct|LIQ|2011}}, {{ct|AND|2011}}, {{ct|THR|2011}}, {{ct|QST|2011}}, {{ct|BMC|2011}}, and {{ct|CSF|2011}}&nbsp;\u2013 avoided incurring penalties over the course of the race, and so shared in winning the Fair Play classification.<ref name=\"finalstandings\" />\n\n===World Rankings points===\nThe Giro was one of 27&nbsp;events throughout the season that contributed points towards the [[2011 UCI World Tour]]. Points were awarded to the top 20&nbsp;finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTU2MzU&ObjTypeCode=FILE&type=FILE&id=NDk5MDY&LangId=1 \n |title=Points scale \u2013 UCI World Ranking \n |publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] \n |accessdate=17 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603221313/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTU2MzU&ObjTypeCode=FILE&type=FILE&id=NDk5MDY&LangId=1 \n |archivedate=3 June 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\nIn early 2012, the points earned by Contador for overall placing were redistributed, and those gained for stage finishes were removed.
