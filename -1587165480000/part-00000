This is done with a view to sustainable development, and hence taking into account environmental, economical and social factors.\n\n==History==\nSCK\u2022CEN was founded in 1952 and originally named ''Studiecentrum voor de Toepassingen van de Kernenergie'' (Research Centre for the Applications of Nuclear Energy), abbreviated to STK. Land was bought in the municipality of [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]] and over the next years many technical, administrative, medical and residential buildings were constructed on the site. From 1956 to 1964 four nuclear research reactors became operational: the BR 1, BR 2, [[BR 3]], the first [[Pressurized water reactor]] in Europe, and VENUS.\n\nIn 1963 SCK\u2022CEN already employed 1300 people, a number that would remain about the same over the next decades. In 1970 SCK\u2022CEN widened its field of activities outside the nuclear sector, but the emphasis remained on nuclear research. In 1990 SCK\u2022CEN was split and a new institute, [[Flemish Institute for Technological Research|VITO]] (Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek; Flemish institute for technological research), took over the non-nuclear activities. SCK\u2022CEN currently has about 850 employees.\n\n==Research activities==\nSCK\u2022CEN's fields of activity go from the deep underground to outer space. The Centres research activities are concentrated into the following main tracks:\n\n;Nuclear Materials Science\n:Research is performed  to improve the knowledge, understanding and numerical simulation of the behaviour of materials under irradiation, and from there on predict their performance. The aim is to develop, assess and validate new materials such as nuclear fuel, construction materials and radioisotopes to be used in nuclear applications.\n\n;Advanced Nuclear Systems\n:Extensive contributions are made to extend the present Belgian expertise in the field of developments related to GEN IV reactor systems and [[ITER]]. In co-operation with the industry and international research teams, R&D efforts are made to develop and test innovative reactor technologies and instrumentation. This will contribute to the construction of an experimental fast spectrum installation (MYRRHA), allowing a.o. transmutation processes to be performed.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n;Environment, Health and Safety\n:Next to specialised R&D in the field of a.o. radiobiology and -ecology, environmental chemistry, decommissioning, radioactive waste management and disposal, SCK\u2022CEN also delivers high-quality{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} measurement services such as radiation dosimetry, calibration and spectrometry. Policy support, decision making and research on the integration of societal aspects into nuclear research contribute to meet complex problems related to radiation protection and energy policy.\n\n;Education and Training\n:Throughout its more than 50 years of research experience in the field of peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology, SCK\u2022CEN has also conducted education and training (E&T). The E&T activities at SCK\u2022CEN cover a. o. reactor physics, reactor operation, reactor engineering, radiation protection, decommissioning and waste management. Next to courses, SCK\u2022CEN also offers students the possibility to perform their research work at our laboratories and research reactors. Final-year students and PhD candidates can enter a programme outlined together with an SCK\u2022CEN mentor and in close collaboration with a university promotor. Post-docs are mainly recruited in specialised research domains that reflect the priority programmes and R&D topics of our{{who|date=February 2016}} institute.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Important installations==\n[[File:BR2 Cooling Towers.jpg|thumb|1221.997314453125x1221.997314453125px|Cooling towers of the BR2 (Belgian Reactor 2) at Boeretang Lake.]]\n;BR 1 (Belgian Reactor 1)\n:The BR1 nuclear reactor became operational in 1956.

The on-surface Ophelie mock-up lasted 5 years (1997-2002) and was intended to study the thermo-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of a [[bentonite]] buffer emplaced around a central heating tube simulating a [[high level waste]] (HLW) canister. Amongst other results, this experiment allowed to detect an important microbial activity in the bentonite buffer and in the water of the hydration system of the experiment. Concentration as high as 0.5 mM in dissolved [[sulfide]] and [[thiosulfate]] were measured in the water and [[microbial corrosion|microbially induced corrosion]] (MIC) was observed on stainless steel after the dismantling of the experiment.<ref>{{Cite report\n| last = Van Humbeeck\n| first = H.\n| author2 = J.

In the second half of the 20th century, this parent store was developed into a chain of department stores across England and Wales. By the turn of the millennium, the flagship store in Croydon was the third-largest department store in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/department-stores/allders-collapses-into-administration/5037641.article |title=Allders collapses into administration |first=Nicola |last=Harrison |newspaper=Retail Week |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}{{subscription}}</ref> The chain was broken up and sold after it went into administration in 2005, although the Croydon store continued trading until 2012, having been purchased by [[Harold Tillman]], the then-owner of the [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] clothing company. On 17 January 2013, the company closed the store along with the website, and the brand ceased to exist.\n\n==Joshua Allder==\nAllders was opened in 1862 at 102 and 103 [[North End, Croydon]], as a \"linen draper and silk mercer\" by Joshua Allder (1838\u20131904) from [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], who had served his apprenticeship in Croydon. His shop was diverse, with special offers on silk dresses and also a morning dress section, and departments offering lower-cost items such as buttons and ribbons. This diversity showed a shrewdness in business and an understanding of his mostly female customers.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\">{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419215209/http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=The Story of a Store |author=Kerry McQueeney |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |newspaper=Croydon Guardian }}</ref>\n\nCroydon was a growing town, and Allder's business grew with it. In 1870, the shop expanded into 104, 106 and 107 North End,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> although he had to wait for some 20 years to acquire 105, a bakery. The wealth Allder made allowed him to play a prominent part in the local community, on the [[Local Board of Health]], on the council of the [[County Borough of Croydon]]<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> for nine years, and in the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] church community. He supported greater rights for his workers, being instrumental in getting local stores closed for a half-day on Wednesdays. Allder died in 1904 leaving a store which had expanded beyond clothing and haberdashery to sell glass and porcelain, among other items.\n\nHis main residence in Pampisford Road, [[South Croydon]], now houses Regina Coeli RC school, and two cul-de-sacs nearby are named Allder Way and Joshua Close.\n\n==Growth==\nIn 1908 Allder's family sold the business to J. W. Holdron and F. C. Bearman, owners of stores in [[Peckham]] and [[Leytonstone]] respectively. They developed the store into 50 departments with 500 staff and owned the business until 1921. It then passed to the Lawrence family, under whose control it became a limited company.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> \n\nIn 1926, the famous North End facade was erected, uniting the frontage of the Croydon premises for the first time. In 1932 an Arcade from North End to George Street was completed,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> proving a  very popular addition to the store. An extension to the restaurant was opened in the same year.\n\nThe building suffered considerable damage in [[World War II]] but never closed. Improvements during the 1950s included the takeover of a cinema auditorium as the gift department and the installation of Croydon's first escalators, built by [[J & E Hall]],  in 1954.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> By 1958, the Lawrence family was forced to sell as a result of death duties incurred after the death of Daniel Arthur Lawrence, managing director. The store was acquired by Jack & Bernard Lyons' [[United Drapery Stores]] (UDS), owners of [[Richard Shops]], [[John Collier (retailer)|John Collier]], Alexandre Tailors and several department stores. The son of D. A. Lawrence, S. John Lawrence, was kept on by UDS as Managing Director. Allders continued to expand, reaching \u00a31 million turnover in 1958 and \u00a33 million by 1963. Fashion's importance declined, with household items taking a greater role.\n\nIn the 1960s there was considerable change in Croydon, particularly the construction of the [[Whitgift Centre]] to the north of Allders, into which the store expanded, and the creation of the St George's Walk development. Transport and lifestyle changes led to greater competition with the [[West End of London|West End]] and further improvements were required to modernise the store. The section fronting George Street was rebuilt and expanded, retaining a Victorian facade, alongside a new addition. Rebuilding works continued into Dingwall Avenue and by 1976 Allders had 1,700 staff and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m\u00b2) of floor space. It was a Croydon landmark and became the third-largest department store in the UK, after [[Harrods]] and [[Selfridges]]. It had the largest carpet department in Europe, amongst other claims. Croydon was by this time a major retail centre.\n\nAllders' immediate competitor, Kennards, was renamed [[Debenhams]] in 1973, along with many other Debenhams stores. To compete with the central buying and advertising of Debenhams and other larger groups, the department stores owned by UDS were all gradually renamed Allders.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> This process began with Shinners of [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in 1979 and later Hinds of [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], Medhursts of [[Bromley]], James Page of [[Camberley]], Mackross of Cardiff, Willis Ludlow of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and Landport Drapery Bazaar (LDB) in [[Portsmouth]]. Only [[Arding and Hobbs]] at [[Clapham Junction]] in London and the furnishing store of Clover at [[Kirkstall]] in [[Leeds]] retained their original identities. A new geometric logo of ten orange 'A's arranged in a circle on brown and cream-coloured stationery, bags and carpets appeared across the group, together with the phrase \"All that a great store should be\".\n\n[[File:North End, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 625263.jpg|thumb|Allders in 1983]]\nIn 1983 the Lyons family sold the UDS Group to [[Hanson plc]] and Allders became a flagship company of the group, with [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]] appearing on Allders' roof in TV adverts. Allders expanded with new stores opening in [[Basildon]] and [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] and in many international airports as [[duty-free]] concessions. A new 'Fourth Floor' was built on the roof of the Croydon store to house a new Audio and Television Department and two new restaurants as well as a link into the staff areas of London House on Dingwall Avenue. The group's brown, cream and orange livery was replaced with a scheme of light blue and gold lettering on a dark blue background.\n\nIn 1989 a [[management buyout]] saw the international arm spun off as a separate company. There was continued upheaval in Croydon with the complete refurbishment of the Whitgift Centre and of parts of the store. The vast carpet department was contracted to a secondary location allowing for the creation of a new perfumery and cosmetics hall at the centre of the ground floor. A new Allders store of {{convert|137000|sqft|m2}} opened at [[Woking]] in 1992. Allders plc was floated on the stock market in 1993.\n\nThe growth of the group rapidly accelerated following stock market flotation with the acquisition of existing stores and the building of new ones. This began with the acquisition of [[Nottingham]] Co-op's lease on their Broad Marsh Centre store and the development of a chain of stand-alone home furnishing stores. The opening of a second Clover store at [[Rotherham]] was succeeded by the development of \"At Home with Allders\" a concept for new stores in out-of-town [[retail park]]s, the first of which opened at [[Aylesford]] in [[Kent]] in 1994. The Clover stores were both rebranded.\n\nIn September 1996 Allders purchased a number of department stores from the [[Owen Owen]] group that traded under the [[Lewis's]] and Owen Owen names. This included branches in [[Basingstoke]], [[Coventry]], [[Ilford]], [[Leeds]], [[Oxford]], [[Redditch]] and [[Slough]].\n\nIn 1997 Allders acquired the bankrupt [[Maple & Co.|Maples]] furniture brand and seven of its retail outlets. These stores were integrated into the Allders At Home portfolio and brought the brand to town centre locations in [[Bromley]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Crawley]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Watford]]. The Bromley outlet, in direct competition with the town's main Allders store, was soon disposed of. The Kingston store, offering a range focussed solely on furniture, beds and carpets, struggled to compete with [[Bentalls]] and [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]. This competition in the town and the frontage of the store being obscured for some time whilst work on the Kingston Bridge was carried out led to the store's closure within two years. A second Kingston store was later opened in the former [[C & A]] building, offering a broader range of merchandise for the home.\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:CroydonNorthEnd.jpg|thumb|North End and Allders in 2005]]\nShares in Allders crashed in 1998 after disappointing sales and difficulties integrating the Maples furniture group. Nevertheless, it continued a policy of expansion, acquiring the premises of the former C & A stores at [[Guildford]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Leicester]] and [[York]] in 2000 and later the large C & A building on the south side of [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. The \"At Home with Allders\" trading name was replaced with \"Allders At Home\" on conversion of a number of the C&A stores to an expanded home format. Problems continued, however. In Croydon, there were plans to build a new shopping centre, [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]], on the store's site and much of the area to the south. A new Allders would be built opposite the Town Hall. Croydon Council's partner in this plan was developer [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]]. In late 2002 Minerva was part of a new group called Scarlett Retail, named after Terry Green's daughter, that bid for Allders, with [[Lehman Brothers]] investment bank and a management team including Terry Green, the former chief executive of [[Debenhams]] and [[British Home Stores|BHS]].\n\nSome felt at the time that Scarlett's bid was based on Minerva's intention to acquire Allders' site for its Park Place project, in order to sell the plot to another retailer, probably John Lewis. The bid was felt by many to be overpriced. Nevertheless, Scarlett paid Tom Hunter an improved price and they landed the company in early 2003 for about \u00a3162m ($316m). Green became chief executive and set about an overhaul of Allders' image. It was claimed that some of the traditional homeware, haberdashery and clothing for middle-aged, middle-income women was reduced, with a new emphasis on young fashion and beauty products, though this was denied by Terry Green.<ref name=\"rankine\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2904441/Allders-chiefs-strategy-was-completely-wrong.html|title=Allders chief's strategy was 'completely wrong'|author=Kate Rankine|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Administration, 2004\u20135==\nIn September 2004, Minerva announced that Allders had made a loss of \u00a322.6m for the year to 30 June 2004,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077705.stm Allders store chain up for sale] BBC News, 8 December 2004</ref> blaming the speed of the transformation of the business.

It was revealed that there was a pensions deficit of \u00a315 million. 130 of the staff at the Croydon headquarters were laid off, including Green and other senior managers. An under-construction store at the [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre]] in [[Plymouth]] was never opened and was split into stores for [[Next (clothing)|Next]] and Primark when the centre opened in October 2005.\n\n[[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]], the administrators, searched for buyers for the chain or individual stores. Of Allders' 50 stores, only 35 received offers, with rival retailers such as [[House of Fraser]], [[British Home Stores|BHS]], [[Debenhams]] and [[Primark]] said to have expressed an interest. The ten remaining stores, including the Oxford Street branch, began closing-down sales on 5 February and had started to close from March 2005: all had closed by May 2005 with the Leeds store being the last to close down on 22 May 2005, with the exception of Croydon.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4570725.stm Allders store closing its doors] BBC News, 22 May 2005</ref>\n\n==Croydon store, 2005\u20132013==\nIn May 2005 it was announced that the owners of [[Jaeger (clothing retailer)|Jaeger]] would take on the flagship Croydon store and that it would continue to trade as Allders. In the first year of operation the new Managing Director, Andrew MacKenzie, turned the fortunes of the company around and projected a \u00a31 million gross profit. Significant investment was made to attract back to the store its Croydon audience.

In the second half of the 20th century, this parent store was developed into a chain of department stores across England and Wales. By the turn of the millennium, the flagship store in Croydon was the third-largest department store in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/department-stores/allders-collapses-into-administration/5037641.article |title=Allders collapses into administration |first=Nicola |last=Harrison |newspaper=Retail Week |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}{{subscription}}</ref> The chain was broken up and sold after it went into administration in 2005, although the Croydon store continued trading until 2012, having been purchased by [[Harold Tillman]], the then-owner of the [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] clothing company. On 17 January 2013, the company closed the store along with the website, and the brand ceased to exist.\n\n==Joshua Allder==\nAllders was opened in 1862 at 102 and 103 [[North End, Croydon]], as a \"linen draper and silk mercer\" by Joshua Allder (1838\u20131904) from [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], who had served his apprenticeship in Croydon. His shop was diverse, with special offers on silk dresses and also a morning dress section, and departments offering lower-cost items such as buttons and ribbons. This diversity showed a shrewdness in business and an understanding of his mostly female customers.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\">{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419215209/http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=The Story of a Store |author=Kerry McQueeney |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |newspaper=Croydon Guardian }}</ref>\n\nCroydon was a growing town, and Allder's business grew with it. In 1870, the shop expanded into 104, 106 and 107 North End,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> although he had to wait for some 20 years to acquire 105, a bakery. The wealth Allder made allowed him to play a prominent part in the local community, on the [[Local Board of Health]], on the council of the [[County Borough of Croydon]]<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> for nine years, and in the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] church community. He supported greater rights for his workers, being instrumental in getting local stores closed for a half-day on Wednesdays. Allder died in 1904 leaving a store which had expanded beyond clothing and haberdashery to sell glass and porcelain, among other items.\n\nHis main residence in Pampisford Road, [[South Croydon]], now houses Regina Coeli RC school, and two cul-de-sacs nearby are named Allder Way and Joshua Close.\n\n==Growth==\nIn 1908 Allder's family sold the business to J. W. Holdron and F. C. Bearman, owners of stores in [[Peckham]] and [[Leytonstone]] respectively. They developed the store into 50 departments with 500 staff and owned the business until 1921. It then passed to the Lawrence family, under whose control it became a limited company.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> \n\nIn 1926, the famous North End facade was erected, uniting the frontage of the Croydon premises for the first time. In 1932 an Arcade from North End to George Street was completed,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> proving a  very popular addition to the store. An extension to the restaurant was opened in the same year.\n\nThe building suffered considerable damage in [[World War II]] but never closed. Improvements during the 1950s included the takeover of a cinema auditorium as the gift department and the installation of Croydon's first escalators, built by [[J & E Hall]],  in 1954.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> By 1958, the Lawrence family was forced to sell as a result of death duties incurred after the death of Daniel Arthur Lawrence, managing director. The store was acquired by Jack & Bernard Lyons' [[United Drapery Stores]] (UDS), owners of [[Richard Shops]], [[John Collier (retailer)|John Collier]], Alexandre Tailors and several department stores. The son of D. A. Lawrence, S. John Lawrence, was kept on by UDS as Managing Director. Allders continued to expand, reaching \u00a31 million turnover in 1958 and \u00a33 million by 1963. Fashion's importance declined, with household items taking a greater role.\n\nIn the 1960s there was considerable change in Croydon, particularly the construction of the [[Whitgift Centre]] to the north of Allders, into which the store expanded, and the creation of the St George's Walk development. Transport and lifestyle changes led to greater competition with the [[West End of London|West End]] and further improvements were required to modernise the store. The section fronting George Street was rebuilt and expanded, retaining a Victorian facade, alongside a new addition. Rebuilding works continued into Dingwall Avenue and by 1976 Allders had 1,700 staff and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m\u00b2) of floor space. It was a Croydon landmark and became the third-largest department store in the UK, after [[Harrods]] and [[Selfridges]]. It had the largest carpet department in Europe, amongst other claims. Croydon was by this time a major retail centre.\n\nAllders' immediate competitor, Kennards, was renamed [[Debenhams]] in 1973, along with many other Debenhams stores. To compete with the central buying and advertising of Debenhams and other larger groups, the department stores owned by UDS were all gradually renamed Allders.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> This process began with Shinners of [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in 1979 and later Hinds of [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], Medhursts of [[Bromley]], James Page of [[Camberley]], Mackross of Cardiff, Willis Ludlow of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and Landport Drapery Bazaar (LDB) in [[Portsmouth]]. Only [[Arding and Hobbs]] at [[Clapham Junction]] in London and the furnishing store of Clover at [[Kirkstall]] in [[Leeds]] retained their original identities. A new geometric logo of ten orange 'A's arranged in a circle on brown and cream-coloured stationery, bags and carpets appeared across the group, together with the phrase \"All that a great store should be\".\n\n[[File:North End, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 625263.jpg|thumb|Allders in 1983]]\nIn 1983 the Lyons family sold the UDS Group to [[Hanson plc]] and Allders became a flagship company of the group, with [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]] appearing on Allders' roof in TV adverts. Allders expanded with new stores opening in [[Basildon]] and [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] and in many international airports as [[duty-free]] concessions. A new 'Fourth Floor' was built on the roof of the Croydon store to house a new Audio and Television Department and two new restaurants as well as a link into the staff areas of London House on Dingwall Avenue. The group's brown, cream and orange livery was replaced with a scheme of light blue and gold lettering on a dark blue background.\n\nIn 1989 a [[management buyout]] saw the international arm spun off as a separate company. There was continued upheaval in Croydon with the complete refurbishment of the Whitgift Centre and of parts of the store. The vast carpet department was contracted to a secondary location allowing for the creation of a new perfumery and cosmetics hall at the centre of the ground floor. A new Allders store of {{convert|137000|sqft|m2}} opened at [[Woking]] in 1992. Allders plc was floated on the stock market in 1993.\n\nThe growth of the group rapidly accelerated following stock market flotation with the acquisition of existing stores and the building of new ones. This began with the acquisition of [[Nottingham]] Co-op's lease on their Broad Marsh Centre store and the development of a chain of stand-alone home furnishing stores. The opening of a second Clover store at [[Rotherham]] was succeeded by the development of \"At Home with Allders\" a concept for new stores in out-of-town [[retail park]]s, the first of which opened at [[Aylesford]] in [[Kent]] in 1994. The Clover stores were both rebranded.\n\nIn September 1996 Allders purchased a number of department stores from the [[Owen Owen]] group that traded under the [[Lewis's]] and Owen Owen names. This included branches in [[Basingstoke]], [[Coventry]], [[Ilford]], [[Leeds]], [[Oxford]], [[Redditch]] and [[Slough]].\n\nIn 1997 Allders acquired the bankrupt [[Maple & Co.|Maples]] furniture brand and seven of its retail outlets. These stores were integrated into the Allders At Home portfolio and brought the brand to town centre locations in [[Bromley]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Crawley]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Watford]]. The Bromley outlet, in direct competition with the town's main Allders store, was soon disposed of. The Kingston store, offering a range focussed solely on furniture, beds and carpets, struggled to compete with [[Bentalls]] and [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]. This competition in the town and the frontage of the store being obscured for some time whilst work on the Kingston Bridge was carried out led to the store's closure within two years. A second Kingston store was later opened in the former [[C & A]] building, offering a broader range of merchandise for the home.\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:CroydonNorthEnd.jpg|thumb|North End and Allders in 2005]]\nShares in Allders crashed in 1998 after disappointing sales and difficulties integrating the Maples furniture group. Nevertheless, it continued a policy of expansion, acquiring the premises of the former C & A stores at [[Guildford]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Leicester]] and [[York]] in 2000 and later the large C & A building on the south side of [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. The \"At Home with Allders\" trading name was replaced with \"Allders At Home\" on conversion of a number of the C&A stores to an expanded home format. Problems continued, however. In Croydon, there were plans to build a new shopping centre, [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]], on the store's site and much of the area to the south. A new Allders would be built opposite the Town Hall. Croydon Council's partner in this plan was developer [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]]. In late 2002 Minerva was part of a new group called Scarlett Retail, named after Terry Green's daughter, that bid for Allders, with [[Lehman Brothers]] investment bank and a management team including Terry Green, the former chief executive of [[Debenhams]] and [[British Home Stores|BHS]].\n\nSome felt at the time that Scarlett's bid was based on Minerva's intention to acquire Allders' site for its Park Place project, in order to sell the plot to another retailer, probably John Lewis. The bid was felt by many to be overpriced. Nevertheless, Scarlett paid Tom Hunter an improved price and they landed the company in early 2003 for about \u00a3162m ($316m). Green became chief executive and set about an overhaul of Allders' image. It was claimed that some of the traditional homeware, haberdashery and clothing for middle-aged, middle-income women was reduced, with a new emphasis on young fashion and beauty products, though this was denied by Terry Green.<ref name=\"rankine\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2904441/Allders-chiefs-strategy-was-completely-wrong.html|title=Allders chief's strategy was 'completely wrong'|author=Kate Rankine|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Administration, 2004\u20135==\nIn September 2004, Minerva announced that Allders had made a loss of \u00a322.6m for the year to 30 June 2004,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077705.stm Allders store chain up for sale] BBC News, 8 December 2004</ref> blaming the speed of the transformation of the business.

There was some early interest that [[Primark]] was to purchase some of the stores<ref>[http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/news/allders.htm Allders news] My Fashion United</ref> but no interest was found in taking on the company as a whole and it was placed in administration on 26 January 2005. It was revealed that there was a pensions deficit of \u00a315 million. 130 of the staff at the Croydon headquarters were laid off, including Green and other senior managers. An under-construction store at the [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre]] in [[Plymouth]] was never opened and was split into stores for [[Next (clothing)|Next]] and Primark when the centre opened in October 2005.\n\n[[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]], the administrators, searched for buyers for the chain or individual stores. Of Allders' 50 stores, only 35 received offers, with rival retailers such as [[House of Fraser]], [[British Home Stores|BHS]], [[Debenhams]] and [[Primark]] said to have expressed an interest. The ten remaining stores, including the Oxford Street branch, began closing-down sales on 5 February and had started to close from March 2005: all had closed by May 2005 with the Leeds store being the last to close down on 22 May 2005, with the exception of Croydon.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4570725.stm Allders store closing its doors] BBC News, 22 May 2005</ref>\n\n==Croydon store, 2005\u20132013==\nIn May 2005 it was announced that the owners of [[Jaeger (clothing retailer)|Jaeger]] would take on the flagship Croydon store and that it would continue to trade as Allders. In the first year of operation the new Managing Director, Andrew MacKenzie, turned the fortunes of the company around and projected a \u00a31 million gross profit. Significant investment was made to attract back to the store its Croydon audience. It was the only Allders store to survive the 2005 administration.\n\nIn April 2006 it was announced that Allders had secured an extension to their lease through to 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.742239.0.allders_safe_for_two_years.php |title=Allders safe for two years |newspaper=Croydon Guardian |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=24 July 2006 }}</ref> The land and store that Allders leased had regular break clauses to the benefit of the \"virtual freehold leaseholder\" held by [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]] subsidiary companies for 250 years.
