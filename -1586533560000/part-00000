As its name suggests, it is aimed at children under 7 who have not started full-day school yet. It is owned by [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]], a division of [[ViacomCBS]].\n\n== History ==\n===1988\u20131993===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Old Nick Jr logo.png|200px|thumb|right|One of the many Nick Jr. logos used from 1988 to 2009.{{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 13 February 2020|F7}}]] -->\nThroughout the 1980s, Nickelodeon aired programs for preschoolers (most prominently ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' and ''[[Today's Special]]'') on weekdays (from 8:00am to 3:00pm) and weekend mornings. After Nickelodeon's preschool block premiered a slew of new shows in 1987, it began using the ''Nick Junior'' branding on January 4, 1988,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ8y7f0g0uI|title=Nickelodeon Early-Morning TV Broadcast from 1988 (with commercials)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref> coinciding with the premiere of ''[[The World of David the Gnome]]''. A new rebrand for the block that shortened its name to ''Nick Jr.'' was slowly rolled out between September 1988 and mid-1989.<ref name=\"Nick Jr. Premieres\">{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline -- Through 1989 |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616133929/http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> Nick Jr.'s new logo was orange for 'Nick' and blue for 'Jr.', and it varied in the shape or species (e.g.: two gears, trains, robots, planets, insects, comets, or elephants). Nick Jr.'s initial [[Station identification|network IDs]] were filmed in live action featuring two children wearing Nick Jr. shirts walking to a refrigerator and opening it, revealing an animated cartoon character. From 1989 to 2000, other companies and animators produced IDs for Nick Jr.\n\nUntil July 1990, ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' was featured, originally for three hours (two in the morning and one at noon), then for one hour starting in spring 1989. When Nick Jr.'s original series ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' premiered in September, ''Pinwheel'' was split into two separate half hours in the morning and afternoon, where it remained until July 1990. Much of Nick Jr.'s other programs at the time were of Japanese or foreign origin (including ''[[Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show]]'', ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'', ''[[The World of David the Gnome|David the Gnome]]'', ''[[Noozles]]'', ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]'', and ''[[The Littl' Bits]]'').\n\n===Grow, Learn, and Play (1993\u20131994)===\nOn April 5, 1993, Nick Jr. premiered a new series ''[[Cappelli & Company]]'' and received a new rebrand which prominently featured a new Nick Jr. logo consisting of an orange parent and a blue child, and the slogan ''Grow, Learn, and Play''. Several Nick Jr. promos and bumpers featured kids playing near the Nick Jr. logo and a theme song with the slogan sung to the melody of [[London Bridge Is Falling Down|''London Bridge'']], and a few featured ''Cappelli & Company'' host [[Frank Cappelli]]. Nick Jr. also started using a female announcer (who was replaced by a different one in 1994, 1998 and 2003) in its promos and bumpers. Nick Jr. began to invest more into producing original interstitial series (including 1994's ''Muppet Time'', forty two-minute shorts from [[The Jim Henson Company]]) in order to stay within a self-imposed limit of five minutes of commercials per hour.\n\nDue to Nick Jr.'s declining ratings as well as competition from [[PBS]]' children's programming and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]]'s ''[[Ready Set Learn]]'' block, Nickelodeon decided to spend $30 million on revamping their Nick Jr. block in 1994.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-03-28.pdf Nick to spend $30 million on kids (page 53)] from Broadcasting & Cable</ref> On April 4, the \"Jim Henson's Muppet Hour\" sub-block was created by pairing ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'' reruns with the new acquisition ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\n===Play to Learn (1994\u20132003)===\nOn September 5, 1994, Nick Jr. rebranded and introduced Face, an animated host that introduced shows and interstitials and led into commercial breaks. In the context of his segments, Face was capable of materializing objects such as an astronaut, a robot, a clown, a window, a traffic light, stars, and even wood. He was also capable of creating a number of foley sound effects and voices including a signature three-note [[trumpet]] noise usually following the name \"Nick Jr.\" and at the end of almost every bumper. Also, he changed colors, moods, and feelings. Face was voiced by [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]], who also narrated several Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. promos. More than 400 Face promos were produced by [[Nickelodeon Digital|Nick Digital]] (from 1994 to 1996 and 2000 to 2003) and DMA Animation (from 1996 to 1999). In October, Nick Jr. introduced two new original series, ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' and ''[[Allegra's Window]]'', resulting in 50% rating gains for the block.\n\nOn September 8, 1996, the first episode of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' premiered in prime-time on [[Nickelodeon]], then debuted on the Nick Jr. block the next day. Nick Jr. also premiered four new interstitial series and received a new rebrand produced by Pittard Sullivan. ''Blue's Clues'' quickly dethroned ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' as Nick Jr.'s most popular series. In 1998, Nick Jr. rebranded again and introduced the \"Just for Me\" slogan.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Nick Jr. replaced most of its older series with newer series such as ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'', ''[[Kipper (TV series)|Kipper]]'', ''[[Maisy]]'', and ''[[Little Bill]]'' which helped increase the block's ratings. Nick Jr. briefly aired reruns of ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' in the Summer of 2000 to promote ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' before replacing it with ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', which became one of Nick Jr.'s most successful series. ''[[Maggie and the Ferocious Beast]]'' premiered on the same day as when the block started airing ''Shining Time Station''. ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' and ''[[Oswald (TV series)|Oswald]]'' premiered in 2001. On September 3, 2001, Nick Jr. received a new rebrand produced by AdamsMorioka (who had previously rebranded Nickelodeon and [[Nick at Nite]]) and Editional Effects.\n\n===Nick Jr. Play Along (2003\u20132004)===\nOn September 1, 2003, Nick Jr. received a rebrand that introduced more than a dozen new logos; ''[[Rubbadubbers]]'' premiered the day after. A new interstitial series called ''Nick Jr. Play Along'' debuted, which were hosted by two fun live-action hosts: Robin (played by actress [[Hillary Hawkins]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Hillary Hawkins|url = http://www.hillaryhawkins.com|website = Hillary Hawkins|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>) and Zack (played by actor Travis Guba<ref>{{cite web|title = About|url = http://www.travisguba.com/about.html|website = www.travisguba.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>). Alongside Robin and Zack were two [[Sock puppet|sock puppets]] called the Feetbeats. \n\nNew Face interstitials were produced featuring a redesigned Face, who has added eyebrows and a chin and straightened the eyes by inverting their colors from white dots on black eyes to larger black dots on white eyes, and was voiced by [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]] announcer Babi Floyd. The new Face promos were produced by Vee-Pee Cartoons. Nick Jr. also removed most of its older interstitial series, although they briefly returned in 2004 due to polarizing reactions to their new interstitial series.\n\n===Love to Play! (2004\u20132007)===\nOn September 13, 2004, Nick Jr. received a rebrand containing interstitials co-produced with [[Little Airplane Productions]] featuring the block's new host Piper O'Possum (voiced by [[Ali Brustofski]]), and the new slogan \"Love to Play\". Nick Jr.'s female announcer was replaced with Kobie Powell and Chris Phillips. Nick Jr. used its new on-screen bug to promote its website, but it was changed on March 6, 2006 after the FCC forbade this and used Nick Jr.'s 2003\u20132004 regular screen bug again. ''[[LazyTown]]'', ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]'' and ''[[The Backyardigans]]'' premiered on Nick Jr. in 2004; they were briefly shown on Noggin during Thanksgiving week before joining Noggin's regular schedule later.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, the Piper O'Possum interstitials ended their 3-year run.\n\n===Play With Us (2007\u20132009)===\nOn September 10, 2007, Nick Jr. received another rebrand. The block's bumpers (which were often similar to Noggin's \"Puzzle Time\" interstitials) encouraged preschoolers to \"Play With Us\" and featured the Nick Jr. logo in the form of two stuffed animals animated in stop-motion. This marks the first time that the Nick Jr. block had no host since 1994. Nick Jr. also stopped airing interstitial series and increased the amount of commercials it aired. Starting in the spring of 2008, the block began at 8:30 am.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, the original block ended its 21-year run, with ''[[Ni Hao, Kai-Lan]]'' being the last show to air on the block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/nick-tv-schedule-january-26-february-1-2009.4664301/|title=Nick TV Schedule: January 26 \u2013 February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nickelodeon branding (2009\u20132014)===\n{{main|Nick Jr.}}\nOn February 2, 2009, the classic Nick Jr. block was re-branded as ''Nick Play Date''; ''[[Olivia (TV series)|Olivia]]'' premiered on the classic block the week before. The block's branding was based on Noggin's branding, and many bumpers featured drawings, finger puppets or cupcakes. The bumpers' music was a choir of kids vocalizing, and [[Nicolette Pierini]] was the announcer of each bumper. On September 28, 2009, Nick Jr. replaced [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] as a 24/7 TV channel as part of Nickelodeon's overall rebrand. In 2011, ''Play Date'' received a new rebrand featuring characters from the block's shows. The following year, the block's ''Play Date'' branding was replaced with a modified version of Nick Jr.'s new branding known as ''Nick: The Smart Place to Play''. Despite Nickelodeon displaying its shows credits during the last 30 seconds before it since 2012, the branding retained the split-screen credits for Nick Jr. shows airing on the block until May 2, 2014.\n\n===Return of Nick Jr. branding (2014\u2013present)===\nOn May 5, 2014, Nickelodeon's preschool block re-branded itself as Nick Jr. while still using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug (and promos starting in 2015). When aired on the Nick Jr. channel, commercials for programs broadcast on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block usually end with \"Over on Nickelodeon\" to differentiate the titles. The Nick Jr. block also began to use Nick's superimposed credits to air more commercials. On June 10, 2015, Nick Jr.'s website was completely redesigned to match up with the Nick Jr. app.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/10/nick-jr-site-gets-a-redesign-debuts-new-preschool-series/|title=Nick Jr. site gets a redesign, debuts new preschool series|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn May 21, 2018, the Nick Jr. block changed its name to \"Nick Jr. on Nick\", refreshing its imaging with new bumpers and curriculum boards. From November 12, 2018 to March 2020, the block reverted back to using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug and in advertisements while retaining the refreshed Nick Jr. bumpers and curriculum boards.\n\n==Slogans==\n*Nick Jr.'s Just For You!

From 2002 to 2004, it was part of the general ''Nick on CBS'' block, which also included programming from the main Nickelodeon channel. The block was replaced by the ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]'' block on September 16, 2006.\n\nSpanish-language American network [[Telemundo]] has aired ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' (from 1998 to 2000, as part of the ''Nickelodeon en Telemundo'' block) and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' (from 2005 to 2006, as part of the ''Telemundo Kids'' block) in Spanish. In Fall of 2006, after the sale of Telemundo to NBC in 2001 and the CBS/Viacom split in early 2006, the ''Telemundo Kids'' block was replaced with a Spanish version of [[NBC]]/[[Ion Television|Ion]]'s ''[[Qubo]]'' block.\n\nOn April 5, 2008, competing Spanish network [[Univision]] added back the Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and also added a Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'' to their Saturday morning ''[[Planeta U]]'' line-up. A Spanish-dubbed version of [[The Backyardigans]] was later added to the line-up on January 8, 2011.\n\nFor a brief time in summer 2010, [[MTV Tres|Tr3s]], a sister network to [[Nickelodeon]], aired a daily block of Spanish-dubbed Nick Jr. programs under the name ''Tr3s Jr.'' Shows like ''Pistas de Blue'' (the Spanish version of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'') and ''[[Wonder Pets!]]'' were featured in the block.\n\n===Face's reappearances===\nFace (the '90s version) made an appearance during the 2012 New Year edition of [[NickRewind|The '90s Are All That]], [[TeenNick]]'s former 1990s-oriented late night block. Face's appearances consisted of out-of-context clips that make him appear to be drunk or making adult comments (e.g.: \"Yeah, grow a pair!\").\n\nFace also appeared in an Easter promo for [[NickRewind|The Splat]], The '90s Are All That's successor, in 2016, encouraging viewers to look for the [[Easter Bunny]] in '90s [[Nickelodeon]] shows.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dance and Sing!

As its name suggests, it is aimed at children under 7 who have not started full-day school yet. It is owned by [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]], a division of [[ViacomCBS]].\n\n== History ==\n===1988\u20131993===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Old Nick Jr logo.png|200px|thumb|right|One of the many Nick Jr. logos used from 1988 to 2009.{{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 13 February 2020|F7}}]] -->\nThroughout the 1980s, Nickelodeon aired programs for preschoolers (most prominently ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' and ''[[Today's Special]]'') on weekdays (from 8:00am to 3:00pm) and weekend mornings. After Nickelodeon's preschool block premiered a slew of new shows in 1987, it began using the ''Nick Junior'' branding on January 4, 1988,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ8y7f0g0uI|title=Nickelodeon Early-Morning TV Broadcast from 1988 (with commercials)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref> coinciding with the premiere of ''[[The World of David the Gnome]]''. A new rebrand for the block that shortened its name to ''Nick Jr.'' was slowly rolled out between September 1988 and mid-1989.<ref name=\"Nick Jr. Premieres\">{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline -- Through 1989 |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616133929/http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2012}}</ref> Nick Jr.'s new logo was orange for 'Nick' and blue for 'Jr.', and it varied in the shape or species (e.g.: two gears, trains, robots, planets, insects, comets, or elephants). Nick Jr.'s initial [[Station identification|network IDs]] were filmed in live action featuring two children wearing Nick Jr. shirts walking to a refrigerator and opening it, revealing an animated cartoon character. From 1989 to 2000, other companies and animators produced IDs for Nick Jr.\n\nUntil July 1990, ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' was featured, originally for three hours (two in the morning and one at noon), then for one hour starting in spring 1989. When Nick Jr.'s original series ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' premiered in September, ''Pinwheel'' was split into two separate half hours in the morning and afternoon, where it remained until July 1990. Much of Nick Jr.'s other programs at the time were of Japanese or foreign origin (including ''[[Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show]]'', ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'', ''[[The World of David the Gnome|David the Gnome]]'', ''[[Noozles]]'', ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]'', and ''[[The Littl' Bits]]'').\n\n===Grow, Learn, and Play (1993\u20131994)===\nOn April 5, 1993, Nick Jr. premiered a new series ''[[Cappelli & Company]]'' and received a new rebrand which prominently featured a new Nick Jr. logo consisting of an orange parent and a blue child, and the slogan ''Grow, Learn, and Play''. Several Nick Jr. promos and bumpers featured kids playing near the Nick Jr. logo and a theme song with the slogan sung to the melody of [[London Bridge Is Falling Down|''London Bridge'']], and a few featured ''Cappelli & Company'' host [[Frank Cappelli]]. Nick Jr. also started using a female announcer (who was replaced by a different one in 1994, 1998 and 2003) in its promos and bumpers. Nick Jr. began to invest more into producing original interstitial series (including 1994's ''Muppet Time'', forty two-minute shorts from [[The Jim Henson Company]]) in order to stay within a self-imposed limit of five minutes of commercials per hour.\n\nDue to Nick Jr.'s declining ratings as well as competition from [[PBS]]' children's programming and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]]'s ''[[Ready Set Learn]]'' block, Nickelodeon decided to spend $30 million on revamping their Nick Jr. block in 1994.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-03-28.pdf Nick to spend $30 million on kids (page 53)] from Broadcasting & Cable</ref> On April 4, the \"Jim Henson's Muppet Hour\" sub-block was created by pairing ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'' reruns with the new acquisition ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\n===Play to Learn (1994\u20132003)===\nOn September 5, 1994, Nick Jr. rebranded and introduced Face, an animated host that introduced shows and interstitials and led into commercial breaks. In the context of his segments, Face was capable of materializing objects such as an astronaut, a robot, a clown, a window, a traffic light, stars, and even wood. He was also capable of creating a number of foley sound effects and voices including a signature three-note [[trumpet]] noise usually following the name \"Nick Jr.\" and at the end of almost every bumper. Also, he changed colors, moods, and feelings. Face was voiced by [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]], who also narrated several Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. promos. More than 400 Face promos were produced by [[Nickelodeon Digital|Nick Digital]] (from 1994 to 1996 and 2000 to 2003) and DMA Animation (from 1996 to 1999). In October, Nick Jr. introduced two new original series, ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' and ''[[Allegra's Window]]'', resulting in 50% rating gains for the block.\n\nOn September 8, 1996, the first episode of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' premiered in prime-time on [[Nickelodeon]], then debuted on the Nick Jr. block the next day. Nick Jr. also premiered four new interstitial series and received a new rebrand produced by Pittard Sullivan. ''Blue's Clues'' quickly dethroned ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' as Nick Jr.'s most popular series. In 1998, Nick Jr. rebranded again and introduced the \"Just for Me\" slogan.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Nick Jr. replaced most of its older series with newer series such as ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'', ''[[Kipper (TV series)|Kipper]]'', ''[[Maisy]]'', and ''[[Little Bill]]'' which helped increase the block's ratings. Nick Jr. briefly aired reruns of ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' in the Summer of 2000 to promote ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' before replacing it with ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', which became one of Nick Jr.'s most successful series. ''[[Maggie and the Ferocious Beast]]'' premiered on the same day as when the block started airing ''Shining Time Station''. ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' and ''[[Oswald (TV series)|Oswald]]'' premiered in 2001. On September 3, 2001, Nick Jr. received a new rebrand produced by AdamsMorioka (who had previously rebranded Nickelodeon and [[Nick at Nite]]) and Editional Effects.\n\n===Nick Jr. Play Along (2003\u20132004)===\nOn September 1, 2003, Nick Jr. premiered the new series ''[[Rubbadubbers]]'' and received a rebrand that introduced more than a dozen new logos. A new interstitial series called ''Nick Jr. Play Along'' debuted, which were hosted by two fun live-action hosts: Robin (played by actress [[Hillary Hawkins]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Hillary Hawkins|url = http://www.hillaryhawkins.com|website = Hillary Hawkins|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>) and Zack (played by actor Travis Guba<ref>{{cite web|title = About|url = http://www.travisguba.com/about.html|website = www.travisguba.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>). Alongside Robin and Zack were two [[Sock puppet|sock puppets]] called the Feetbeats. \n\nNew Face interstitials were produced featuring a redesigned Face, who has added eyebrows and a chin and straightened the eyes by inverting their colors from white dots on black eyes to larger black dots on white eyes, and was voiced by [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]] announcer Babi Floyd. The new Face promos were produced by Vee-Pee Cartoons. Nick Jr. also removed most of its older interstitial series, although they briefly returned in 2004 due to polarizing reactions to their new interstitial series.\n\n===Love to Play! (2004\u20132007)===\nOn September 13, 2004, Nick Jr. received a rebrand containing interstitials co-produced with [[Little Airplane Productions]] featuring the block's new host Piper O'Possum (voiced by [[Ali Brustofski]]), and the new slogan \"Love to Play\". Nick Jr.'s female announcer was replaced with Kobie Powell and Chris Phillips. Nick Jr. used its new on-screen bug to promote its website, but it was changed on March 6, 2006 after the FCC forbade this and used Nick Jr.'s 2003\u20132004 regular screen bug again. ''[[LazyTown]]'', ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]'' and ''[[The Backyardigans]]'' premiered on Nick Jr. in 2004; they were briefly shown on Noggin during Thanksgiving week before joining Noggin's regular schedule later.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, the Piper O'Possum interstitials ended their 3-year run.\n\n===Play With Us (2007\u20132009)===\nOn September 10, 2007, Nick Jr. received another rebrand. The block's bumpers (which were often similar to Noggin's \"Puzzle Time\" interstitials) encouraged preschoolers to \"Play With Us\" and featured the Nick Jr. logo in the form of two stuffed animals animated in stop-motion. This marks the first time that the Nick Jr. block had no host since 1994. Nick Jr. also stopped airing interstitial series and increased the amount of commercials it aired. Starting in the spring of 2008, the block began at 8:30 am.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, the original block ended its 21-year run, with ''[[Ni Hao, Kai-Lan]]'' being the last show to air on the block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/nick-tv-schedule-january-26-february-1-2009.4664301/|title=Nick TV Schedule: January 26 \u2013 February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nickelodeon branding (2009\u20132014)===\n{{main|Nick Jr.}}\nOn February 2, 2009, the classic Nick Jr. block was re-branded as ''Nick Play Date''; ''[[Olivia (TV series)|Olivia]]'' premiered on the classic block the week before. The block's branding was based on Noggin's branding, and many bumpers featured drawings, finger puppets or cupcakes. The bumpers' music was a choir of kids vocalizing, and [[Nicolette Pierini]] was the announcer of each bumper. On September 28, 2009, Nick Jr. replaced [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] as a 24/7 TV channel as part of Nickelodeon's overall rebrand. In 2011, ''Play Date'' received a new rebrand featuring characters from the block's shows. The following year, the block's ''Play Date'' branding was replaced with a modified version of Nick Jr.'s new branding known as ''Nick: The Smart Place to Play''. Despite Nickelodeon displaying its shows credits during the last 30 seconds before it since 2012, the branding retained the split-screen credits for Nick Jr. shows airing on the block until May 2, 2014.\n\n===Return of Nick Jr. branding (2014\u2013present)===\nOn May 5, 2014, Nickelodeon's preschool block re-branded itself as Nick Jr. while still using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug (and promos starting in 2015). When aired on the Nick Jr. channel, commercials for programs broadcast on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block usually end with \"Over on Nickelodeon\" to differentiate the titles. The Nick Jr. block also began to use Nick's superimposed credits to air more commercials. On June 10, 2015, Nick Jr.'s website was completely redesigned to match up with the Nick Jr. app.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/10/nick-jr-site-gets-a-redesign-debuts-new-preschool-series/|title=Nick Jr. site gets a redesign, debuts new preschool series|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn May 21, 2018, the Nick Jr. block changed its name to \"Nick Jr. on Nick\", refreshing its imaging with new bumpers and curriculum boards. From November 12, 2018 to March 2020, the block reverted back to using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug and in advertisements while retaining the refreshed Nick Jr. bumpers and curriculum boards.\n\n==Slogans==\n*Nick Jr.'s Just For You!

From 2002 to 2004, it was part of the general ''Nick on CBS'' block, which also included programming from the main Nickelodeon channel. The block was replaced by the ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]'' block on September 16, 2006.\n\nSpanish-language American network [[Telemundo]] has aired ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' (from 1998 to 2000, as part of the ''Nickelodeon en Telemundo'' block) and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' (from 2005 to 2006, as part of the ''Telemundo Kids'' block) in Spanish. In Fall of 2006, after the sale of Telemundo to NBC in 2001 and the CBS/Viacom split in early 2006, the ''Telemundo Kids'' block was replaced with a Spanish version of [[NBC]]/[[Ion Television|Ion]]'s ''[[Qubo]]'' block.\n\nOn April 5, 2008, competing Spanish network [[Univision]] added back the Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and also added a Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'' to their Saturday morning ''[[Planeta U]]'' line-up.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J. ''Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets''.  New York Institute of Finance, 1999, pp. 1-5, 24-31. {{ISBN|0-7352-0066-1}}</ref>\n\nTechnicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known [[Head and shoulders (chart pattern)|head and shoulders]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders |title=PrimePair.com Head and Shoulders Pattern |access-date=2015-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106114558/http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders#Head_and_Shoulders |archive-date=2015-01-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> or [[double top and double bottom|double top/bottom]] reversal patterns, study [[technical indicator]]s, [[moving average]]s, and look for forms such as lines of support, resistance, channels, and more obscure formations such as [[Flag and pennant patterns#The Flag Pattern|flags]], [[Flag and pennant patterns#Pennant pattern|pennants]], balance days and [[cup and handle]] patterns.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part III: Classical Chart Analysis}}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy. Methods vary greatly, and different technical analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits.

In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH.

The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V.

This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J. ''Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets''.  New York Institute of Finance, 1999, pp. 1-5, 24-31. {{ISBN|0-7352-0066-1}}</ref>\n\nTechnicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known [[Head and shoulders (chart pattern)|head and shoulders]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders |title=PrimePair.com Head and Shoulders Pattern |access-date=2015-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106114558/http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders#Head_and_Shoulders |archive-date=2015-01-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> or [[double top and double bottom|double top/bottom]] reversal patterns, study [[technical indicator]]s, [[moving average]]s, and look for forms such as lines of support, resistance, channels, and more obscure formations such as [[Flag and pennant patterns#The Flag Pattern|flags]], [[Flag and pennant patterns#Pennant pattern|pennants]], balance days and [[cup and handle]] patterns.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part III: Classical Chart Analysis}}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R. Lawrence. [http://people.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/research/Papers/nn.pdf Using Neural Networks to Forecast Stock Market Prices]</ref><ref>B.Egeli et al.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy. Methods vary greatly, and different technical analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits.

In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH.

The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V.

This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992-1996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.

Some countries' [[driving test]]s have been expanded to test a new driver's behavior during emergencies, and their hazard perception.\n\nThere are demographic differences in crash rates.

In 1969 Leeming warned that there is a balance to be struck when \"improving\" the safety of a road:<ref name=leeming/>\n\nConversely, a location that does not look dangerous may have a high crash frequency. This is, in part, because if drivers perceive a location as hazardous, they take more care. Collisions may be more likely to happen when hazardous road or traffic conditions are not obvious at a glance, or where the conditions are too complicated for the limited [[Human factors|human machine]] to perceive and react in the time and distance available. High incidence of crashes is not indicative of high injury risk. Crashes are common in areas of high vehicle congestion, but fatal crashes occur disproportionately on rural roads at night when traffic is relatively light.\n\nThis phenomenon has been observed in [[risk compensation]] research, where the predicted reductions in collision rates have not occurred after legislative or technical changes. One study observed that the introduction of improved brakes resulted in more aggressive driving,<ref>{{cite book | last = Sagberg, Fosser, & Saetermo | title = An investigation of behavioral adaptation to airbags and antilock brakes among taxi drivers | publisher = Accident Analysis and Prevention | edition = 29 | pages = 293\u2013302 | year = 1997 }}</ref> and another argued that compulsory seat belt laws have not been accompanied by a clearly attributed fall in overall fatalities.<ref>{{cite web | title = The efficacy of seat belt legislation | last = Adams | first = John | publisher = SAE Transactions | year =  1982 | url = http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf }}</ref> Most claims of risk compensation offsetting the effects of vehicle regulation and belt use laws have been discredited by research using more refined data.<ref name=Rob4th/>\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Hans Monderman]]'s studies of driver behavior led him to the realization that signs and regulations had an adverse effect on a driver's ability to interact safely with other road users. Monderman developed [[shared space]] principles, rooted in the principles of the [[woonerf|woonerven]] of the 1970s. He concluded that the removal of highway clutter, while allowing drivers and other road users to mingle with equal priority, could help drivers recognize environmental clues. They relied on their cognitive skills alone, reducing traffic speeds radically and resulting in lower levels of road casualties and lower levels of congestion.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Streets ahead |author=Ben Hamilton-Baillie |date=Autumn 2005 |publisher=Countryside Voice |url=http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/Countryside_Voice1.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413195637/http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/Countryside_Voice1.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome crashes are intended; [[staged crash]]es, for example, involve at least one party who hopes to crash a vehicle in order to submit lucrative claims to an insurance company.<ref>Lascher, Edward L. and Michael R.

Other initiatives were accelerated as a reaction to consumer pressure, after publications such as [[Ralph Nader]]'s 1965 book ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' accused motor manufacturers of indifference towards safety.\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[British Leyland]] started an intensive programme of vehicle safety research, producing a number of prototype [[Experimental Safety Vehicle|experimental safety vehicles]] demonstrating various innovations for occupant and pedestrian protection such as [[air bag]]s, [[anti-lock brakes]], impact-absorbing side-panels, front and rear head restraints, run-flat tires, smooth and deformable front-ends, impact-absorbing bumpers, and retractable headlamps.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety First: the SSV/SRV cars|work=AROnline|publisher=Keith Adams|url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?researchsrvf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008203617/http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?researchsrvf.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-10-08}}</ref> Design has also been influenced by government legislation, such as the [[Euro NCAP]] [[Crash test|impact test]].\n\nCommon features designed to improve safety include thicker pillars, safety glass, interiors with no sharp edges, [[crumple zone|stronger bodies]], other active or passive safety features, and smooth exteriors to reduce the consequences of an impact with pedestrians.\n\nThe UK [[Department for Transport]] publish road casualty statistics for each type of collision and vehicle through its [[Road Casualties Great Britain]] report.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/accidents/ | title = Annual transport accidents and casualties | publisher = UK Department for Transport | accessdate = 1 January 2008 }}</ref>\nThese statistics show a ten to one ratio of in-vehicle fatalities between types of car. In most cars, occupants have a 2\u20138% chance of death in a two-car collision.\n\n;Center of gravity\nSome crash types tend to have more serious consequences. [[Vehicle rollover|Rollover]]s have become more common in recent years, perhaps due to increased popularity of taller [[SUV]]s, [[people carrier]]s, and [[minivan]]s, which have a higher [[center of gravity]] than standard passenger cars. Rollovers can be fatal, especially if the occupants are ejected because they were not wearing [[seat belts]] (83% of ejections during rollovers were fatal when the driver did not wear a seat belt, compared to 25% when they did).<ref name=ppr172 />\nAfter a new design of [[Mercedes Benz]] notoriously failed a '[[moose test]]' (sudden swerving to avoid an obstacle), some manufacturers enhanced suspension using [[Electronic Stability Control|stability control]] linked to an [[anti-lock braking system]] to reduce the likelihood of rollover. After retrofitting these systems to its models in 1999\u20132000, Mercedes saw its models involved in fewer crashes.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fahrunfalle: Dank ESP verunglucken Mercedes-Personenwagen seltener (in German) | url=http://www.whnet.com/4x4/pix/esp_stat.jpg  | accessdate = 28 December 2007 | publisher = Mercedes Benz | format = Graph of accident share | quote = Road accidents are rare with ESP Mercedes passenger cars |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102118/http://www.whnet.com/4x4/pix/esp_stat.jpg <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nNow, about 40% of new US vehicles, mainly the SUVs, vans and pickup trucks that are more susceptible to rollover, are being produced with a lower [[center of gravity]] and enhanced suspension with [[Electronic Stability Control|stability control]] linked to its [[anti-lock braking system]] to reduce the risk of rollover and meet US federal requirements that mandate anti-rollover technology by September 2011.<ref name=ij >{{Citation | title = U.S. to Require Anti-Rollover Technology on New Cars by 2012  | url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2006/09/15/72448.htm  | accessdate = 28 December 2007 | publisher = Insurance Journal | date = 15 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n;Motorcycles\nMotorcyclists have little protection other than their [[Motorcycle safety clothing|clothing]] and helmets.

That is, some measure of harm (deaths, injuries, or number of crashes) divided by some measure of exposure to the risk of this harm. Rates are used so the safety performance of different locations can be compared, and to prioritize safety improvements.\n\nCommon rates related to road traffic fatalities include the number of deaths per capita, per registered vehicle, per licensed driver, or per vehicle mile or kilometer traveled. Simple counts are almost never used. The annual count of fatalities is a rate, namely, the number of fatalities per year.\n\nThere is no one rate that is superior to others in any general sense. The rate to be selected depends on the question being asked \u2013 and often also on what data are available. What is important is to specify exactly what rate is measured and how it relates to the problem being addressed. Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled. Others combine rates. The U.S. state of [[Iowa]], for example, selects high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity).<ref>{{cite web |last=Hallmark |first=Shauna |title=Evaluation of the Iowa DOT's Safety Improvement Candidate List Process |type=Final Report |publisher=Center for Transportation Research and Education, Iowa State university |date=June 2002 |url=http://www.intrans.iastate.edu/reports/SafetyCandidate.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Fatality===\nThe definition of a road-traffic fatality varies from country to country.

In the U.S., therefore, if a driver has a non-fatal heart attack that leads to a road-traffic crash that causes death, that is a road-traffic fatality. However, if the heart attack causes death prior to the crash, then that is not a road-traffic fatality.\n\nThe definition of a road-traffic fatality can change with time in the same country. For example, fatality was defined in France as a person who dies in the six days (pre 2005) after the collision and was subsequently changed to the 30 days (post 2005) after the collision.<ref>[http://www.iraptranstats.net/defn_safety International Road Assistance Programme] \u2013 International Transport Statistics Database</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fardier a vapeur.gif|thumb|left|The ''fardier \u00e0 vapeur'' of [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] allegedly crashed into a wall in 1771.<ref>However, the first known account of this crash dates to 1801.{{cite web|title=Le fardier de Cugnot|url=http://www.ile-de-france.drire.gouv.fr/vehicules/homolo/cnrv/histoire.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226105105/http://www.ile-de-france.drire.gouv.fr/vehicules/homolo/cnrv/histoire.htm|archivedate=26 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n\nThe world's first recorded road traffic death involving a motor vehicle occurred on 31 August 1869.<ref name=OffalyHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/268/1/Mary-Ward-1827-1869/Page1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201221657/http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/268/1/Mary-Ward-1827-1869/Page1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2010 |title=Mary Ward 1827-1869 |publisher=Offaly Historical & Archaeological Society |date=2 September 2007 |series=King's County Chronicle |accessdate=20 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Irish scientist [[Mary Ward (scientist)|Mary Ward]] died when she fell out of her cousins' steam car and was run over by it.<ref group=\"note\">Although some sources assert Mary Rose to be the first person killed by a motor vehicle, a [[steam carriage]] fatal collision in July 1834 preceded Rose's demise.

Though English, John Salt was drawn to American landscapes of wrecked vehicles like ''Desert Wreck'' (airbrushed oil on linen, 1972).<ref>{{cite web|title=Desert Wreck|url=https://es.pinterest.com/pin/429601251925706012/|website=es.pinterest.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>  Similarly, Jan Anders Nelson works with the wreck in its resting state in junkyards or forests, or as elements in his paintings and drawings.

This is, in part, because if drivers perceive a location as hazardous, they take more care. Collisions may be more likely to happen when hazardous road or traffic conditions are not obvious at a glance, or where the conditions are too complicated for the limited [[Human factors|human machine]] to perceive and react in the time and distance available. High incidence of crashes is not indicative of high injury risk. Crashes are common in areas of high vehicle congestion, but fatal crashes occur disproportionately on rural roads at night when traffic is relatively light.\n\nThis phenomenon has been observed in [[risk compensation]] research, where the predicted reductions in collision rates have not occurred after legislative or technical changes. One study observed that the introduction of improved brakes resulted in more aggressive driving,<ref>{{cite book | last = Sagberg, Fosser, & Saetermo | title = An investigation of behavioral adaptation to airbags and antilock brakes among taxi drivers | publisher = Accident Analysis and Prevention | edition = 29 | pages = 293\u2013302 | year = 1997 }}</ref> and another argued that compulsory seat belt laws have not been accompanied by a clearly attributed fall in overall fatalities.<ref>{{cite web | title = The efficacy of seat belt legislation | last = Adams | first = John | publisher = SAE Transactions | year =  1982 | url = http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf }}</ref> Most claims of risk compensation offsetting the effects of vehicle regulation and belt use laws have been discredited by research using more refined data.<ref name=Rob4th/>\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Hans Monderman]]'s studies of driver behavior led him to the realization that signs and regulations had an adverse effect on a driver's ability to interact safely with other road users. Monderman developed [[shared space]] principles, rooted in the principles of the [[woonerf|woonerven]] of the 1970s. He concluded that the removal of highway clutter, while allowing drivers and other road users to mingle with equal priority, could help drivers recognize environmental clues. They relied on their cognitive skills alone, reducing traffic speeds radically and resulting in lower levels of road casualties and lower levels of congestion.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Streets ahead |author=Ben Hamilton-Baillie |date=Autumn 2005 |publisher=Countryside Voice |url=http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/Countryside_Voice1.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413195637/http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/Countryside_Voice1.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome crashes are intended; [[staged crash]]es, for example, involve at least one party who hopes to crash a vehicle in order to submit lucrative claims to an insurance company.<ref>Lascher, Edward L. and Michael R.

That is, some measure of harm (deaths, injuries, or number of crashes) divided by some measure of exposure to the risk of this harm. Rates are used so the safety performance of different locations can be compared, and to prioritize safety improvements.\n\nCommon rates related to road traffic fatalities include the number of deaths per capita, per registered vehicle, per licensed driver, or per vehicle mile or kilometer traveled. Simple counts are almost never used. The annual count of fatalities is a rate, namely, the number of fatalities per year.\n\nThere is no one rate that is superior to others in any general sense. The rate to be selected depends on the question being asked \u2013 and often also on what data are available. What is important is to specify exactly what rate is measured and how it relates to the problem being addressed. Some agencies concentrate on crashes per total vehicle distance traveled. Others combine rates. The U.S. state of [[Iowa]], for example, selects high collision locations based on a combination of crashes per million miles traveled, crashes per mile per year, and value loss (crash severity).<ref>{{cite web |last=Hallmark |first=Shauna |title=Evaluation of the Iowa DOT's Safety Improvement Candidate List Process |type=Final Report |publisher=Center for Transportation Research and Education, Iowa State university |date=June 2002 |url=http://www.intrans.iastate.edu/reports/SafetyCandidate.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Fatality===\nThe definition of a road-traffic fatality varies from country to country. In the United States, the definition used in the [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System]] (FARS)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/ |title=FARS |publisher=Fars.nhtsa.dot.gov |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> run by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) is a person who dies within 30 days of a crash on a US public road involving a vehicle with an engine, the death being the result of the crash. In the U.S., therefore, if a driver has a non-fatal heart attack that leads to a road-traffic crash that causes death, that is a road-traffic fatality. However, if the heart attack causes death prior to the crash, then that is not a road-traffic fatality.\n\nThe definition of a road-traffic fatality can change with time in the same country. For example, fatality was defined in France as a person who dies in the six days (pre 2005) after the collision and was subsequently changed to the 30 days (post 2005) after the collision.<ref>[http://www.iraptranstats.net/defn_safety International Road Assistance Programme] \u2013 International Transport Statistics Database</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fardier a vapeur.gif|thumb|left|The ''fardier \u00e0 vapeur'' of [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] allegedly crashed into a wall in 1771.<ref>However, the first known account of this crash dates to 1801.{{cite web|title=Le fardier de Cugnot|url=http://www.ile-de-france.drire.gouv.fr/vehicules/homolo/cnrv/histoire.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226105105/http://www.ile-de-france.drire.gouv.fr/vehicules/homolo/cnrv/histoire.htm|archivedate=26 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n\nThe world's first recorded road traffic death involving a motor vehicle occurred on 31 August 1869.<ref name=OffalyHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/268/1/Mary-Ward-1827-1869/Page1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201221657/http://www.offalyhistory.com/articles/268/1/Mary-Ward-1827-1869/Page1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2010 |title=Mary Ward 1827-1869 |publisher=Offaly Historical & Archaeological Society |date=2 September 2007 |series=King's County Chronicle |accessdate=20 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Irish scientist [[Mary Ward (scientist)|Mary Ward]] died when she fell out of her cousins' steam car and was run over by it.<ref group=\"note\">Although some sources assert Mary Rose to be the first person killed by a motor vehicle, a [[steam carriage]] fatal collision in July 1834 preceded Rose's demise.

[[John Scott Russell#Steam carriage|Russell's carriage]] comprised a steam engine pulling an combined passenger and fuel tender; Mary Rose's collision may be characterized as the first fatality involving a vehicle in the form of a contemporary motorcar, in which the engine is mounted and passengers ride on the same frame.</ref>\n\nThe British [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|road engineer]] [[J.

Nelson (graphite on Strathmore rag, 1974)]]\nCars have come to represent a part of the [[American Dream]] of ownership coupled with the freedom of the road.  The violence of a car wreck provides a counterpoint to that promise and is the subject of artwork by a number of artists, such as [[John Salt]] and [[Li Yan (artist)|Li Yan]]. Though English, John Salt was drawn to American landscapes of wrecked vehicles like ''Desert Wreck'' (airbrushed oil on linen, 1972).<ref>{{cite web|title=Desert Wreck|url=https://es.pinterest.com/pin/429601251925706012/|website=es.pinterest.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>  Similarly, Jan Anders Nelson works with the wreck in its resting state in junkyards or forests, or as elements in his paintings and drawings. ''American Landscape'' <ref>{{cite web|title=American Landscape|url=http://www.janandersnelsonart.com/#!drawings---art/c1r52|website=www.janandersnelsonart.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref> is one example of Nelson\u00b4s focus on the violence of the wreck with cars and trucks piled into a heap, left to the forces of nature and time. This recurring theme of violence is echoed in the work of Li Yan. His painting ''Accident N\u00ba 6'' looks at the energy released during a crash.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accident N\u00ba 6 detail|url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/artpages/li_yan_accident6_7.htm|website=www.saatchigallery.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Accident N\u00ba 6 detail|url=http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/artpages/li_yan_accident6_4.htm|website=www.saatchigallery.com|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wreckage in Art: A Driving Force in the Work of Jan Anders Nelson|url=https://medium.com/@ladantacantaba/wreckage-in-art-a-driving-force-in-the-work-of-jan-anders-nelson-3048a7c34a61#.w9ma07jiu|website=medium.com|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Andy Warhol]] used newspaper pictures of car wrecks with dead occupants in a number of his ''Disaster'' series of silkscreened canvases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Warhol Death And Disaster|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbt5iEKdw-s|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]] used components of wrecked cars (such as [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]]s and crumpled [[sheet metal]] [[fender (vehicle)|fender]]s) in his welded sculptures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Randy|title=John Chamberlain, Who Wrested Rough Magic From Scrap Metal, Dies at 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/arts/design/john-chamberlain-artist-of-auto-metal-dies-at-84.html?_r=0|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=The New York Times|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Accident management]]\n* [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead]]\n* [[Black ice]]\n* [[Crash test]]\n* [[Crashworthiness]]\n* [[Defensive driving]]\n* [[Forensic engineering]]\n* [[Global road safety for workers]]\n* [[Hill jumping]]\n* [[List of countries by traffic-related death rate]]\n* [[List of traffic collisions]]\n* [[Multiple-vehicle collision]]\n* [[Roadkill]]\n* [[Roadside memorial]]\n* [[Skid mark]]\n* [[Solomon curve]]\n* [[Totaled]]\n* [[Transportation safety in the United States]]\n* [[Tree squirrel#As roadkill and traffic hazards|Tree squirrel]] (as traffic hazard)\n* [[Underride collision]]\n* ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]''\n* [[Vehicular accident reconstruction]]\n* [[Vehicle extrication]]\n* [[Work-related road safety in the United States]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  ICD10   = {{ICD10|V|89|2}} ''or'' {{ICD10|V|99||v|01}}\n|  ICD9    = {{ICD9|E810}} - {{ICD9|E819}}\n| MeSH=D000063\n}}\n{{Commons|Car accident}}\n*[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_traffic/en/ WHO road traffic injuries]\n*[http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/cats/listpublications.aspx?Id=E&ShowBy=DocType NHTSA Accident Statistics]\n*[http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/ U.S. DOT Fatality Analysis Reporting System] FARS\n{{Road accidents}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Traffic collisions| ]]\n[[Category:Causes of death]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u00b4s \u2192 's (4)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"}
