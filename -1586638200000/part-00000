{"title_page": "Electric go-kart", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2014}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}\nAn '''electric go-kart''' is a type of [[go-kart]] powered by [[electric motor]]s and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], as opposed to traditional [[petrol engine]]. Electric go-karts are mostly intended for recreational usage, though high-performance models for a more serious [[kart racing]] are also offered.\n\n== Advantages / disadvantages ==\n\n=== Advantages ===\nAcceleration is usually better than conventional petrol engine karts and the speed is sufficient for use on most [[kart circuit]]s. Torque in electric motors are usually greater than that of a petrol engine equivalent.\n\nElectric go-karts are low maintenance, requiring only that the [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid]] batteries of the karts to be plugged into an array of chargers after each run. Since they are pollution-free and emit no smoke, the racetracks can be indoors in controlled environments. Most fully charged electric karts powered by lead-acid batteries can run a maximum of 30 minutes before performance is affected. An alternative is [[lithium-polymer battery|lithium polymer]] or [[lithium-ion battery|lithium ion]] batteries, which last longer and offer higher performance.\n\nElectric go-karts do not have fuel tanks or other flammable materials which can prove to be safer in case of an accident. However, batteries (especially lithium polymer batteries) can still catch fire or explode if severely damaged during such accident.\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nDespite having a lower maintenance, electric go-karts often have higher operating and maintenance costs, as batteries and electric motors are typically more expensive than that of conventional engine, especially those powered by lithium batteries. \n\nElectric go-karts powered by lead-acid batteries are low-powered and have a very short battery life; these go-karts can only run a maximum of 20 or 30 minutes before performance is affected, thus making it unsuitable for use in more serious racing.

The '''Championship kicked-off on May 1''' on the historical Kandava go-kart track and during the season 6 rounds have been completed on different tracks in total. The Latvian Electric Kart Championship finals ended on the Jelgava track \u201cRul\u012btis\u201d, where the winners of the Championship in the overall ranking were determined. [[File:Electric kart championship.jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe first champion to take the gold medal was '''Ri\u010dards Irbe''', who won 5 times in a row.  The second place in the overall ranking belongs to '''Raivis Veiksans''', who took the silver, while the third place and the bronze medal belongs to '''Raistis Plukss'''. 16 different racers from Latvia and Lithuania participated in the competition altogether. \nIn the Championship all the racers started off on electric kart powertrains made by [http://blueshockrace.com Blue Shock Race], with a power output of 15 kW in Tek class and up to 25 kW power output in TeK Open class. During the Championship the best lap time was shown by '''Raivis Veiksans: 49.836 seconds'''.  [[File:Blue Shock Race World's first.jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe Championship was launched in partnership with the '''LMT Autosport Academy''', which has been engaging in involving young people in motorsports for several years now. Thanks to the experience of the Academy and involvement of \u201c-teen\u201d technical schools in the '''Latvian Electric Kart Championship''', it has become possible to gather 10 teams, which have worked hard on improving their equipment and have started off in the Championship. \n'''Blue Shock Race''' is a company that has been working with electric karts for 4 years already, developing this technology both in Latvia and throughout the World. Thanks to the '''Blue Shock Race''' experience, budget-friendly, technologically simple, and racing-friendly solutions have been created, allowing the racers to start off in the electric kart classes. \n\nSince another World's Electric Kart Championship was launched in '''Germany on May 13''', now both of these countries, Latvia and Germany, can be considered as pioneers when it comes to holding National Electric Kart Championships, and in fact, both countries deserve to bear the title of the First Championship.\nCurrently '''Blue Shock Race''' is working on the development of new racing karts with a maximum output up to 55 kW with an ultimate racing capacity that can accelerate to 100km/h in about 2,2 seconds, making this class an upper professional class. \n\nIn 2018 '''FIA''' and '''IOC''' have introduced Electric Karting as the first motorsport in the Youth Olympics and taking it to the '''2024 Olympics in Paris''', that's when the Blue Shock Race has set aim to go for the first Olympic Gold medals in the Electric Karting division. \n[[File:Joan Todt FIA President.jpg|thumb]]\n\nAfter Latvian national electric kart championship stage 4 in Kandava Latvian company Blue Shock Race launched new electric sports kart for professionals.

An alternative is [[lithium-polymer battery|lithium polymer]] or [[lithium-ion battery|lithium ion]] batteries, which last longer and offer higher performance.\n\nElectric go-karts do not have fuel tanks or other flammable materials which can prove to be safer in case of an accident. However, batteries (especially lithium polymer batteries) can still catch fire or explode if severely damaged during such accident.\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nDespite having a lower maintenance, electric go-karts often have higher operating and maintenance costs, as batteries and electric motors are typically more expensive than that of conventional engine, especially those powered by lithium batteries. \n\nElectric go-karts powered by lead-acid batteries are low-powered and have a very short battery life; these go-karts can only run a maximum of 20 or 30 minutes before performance is affected, thus making it unsuitable for use in more serious racing. Because of this, a more expensive lithium batteries are commonly used for professional electric kart racing.\n\n\n[[File:RESRace2startinggrid.jpg|thumb|Red Line Oil Karting Championship at [[Sonoma Raceway]], 2013.]]\n\n== Racing ==\nThe ERDF Masters Kart racing event took place at the [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy|Paris-Bercy Arena]] in Paris, France in December 2011.

The '''Championship kicked-off on May 1''' on the historical Kandava go-kart track and during the season 6 rounds have been completed on different tracks in total. The Latvian Electric Kart Championship finals ended on the Jelgava track \u201cRul\u012btis\u201d, where the winners of the Championship in the overall ranking were determined.

It fought in colonial engagements in China during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Italo-Turkish War|Libya (1911-1912)]], on the [[Alps]] against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] during [[World War I]], in [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] during the [[Interwar period]], and in [[World War II]] in [[Albania]], [[Greece]], [[North Africa]] and [[Russia]], as well as in the [[Italian Civil War]]. During the [[Cold War]] the Army prepared itself to defend against a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion from the east. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it has seen extensive peacekeeping service in [[Lebanon]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. On 29 July 2004 it became a professional all-volunteer force when [[conscription]] was finally ended.\n\n===Marina Militare===\n{{Main article|Italian Navy}}\n\nThe navy of Italy was created in 1861, following the [[proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy]], as the ''[[Regia Marina]]''. The new navy's baptism of fire came during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] against the [[Austrian Empire]]. During the [[First World War]], it spent its major efforts in the [[Adriatic Sea]], fighting the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. In the [[Second World War]], it engaged the [[Royal Navy]] in a two-and-a-half-year struggle for the control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. After the war, the new ''Marina Militare'', being a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations.It is a [[blue-water navy]]. The ''[[Guardia Costiera]]'' (Coast Guard) is a component of the navy.\n\n===Aeronautica Militare===\n{{Main article|Italian Air Force}}\n\nThe [[air force]] of Italy was founded as an independent service arm on 28 March 1923, by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Vittorio Emanuele III]] as the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (which equates to \"Royal Air Force\"). During the 1930s, it was involved in its first military operations in Ethiopia in 1935, and later in the [[Spanish Civil War]] between 1936 and 1939. Eventually, Italy entered [[World War II]] alongside Germany. After the armistice of 8 September 1943, Italy was divided into two sides, and the same fate befell the ''Regia Aeronautica''. The Air Force was split into the ''[[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]]'' in the south aligned with the Allies, and the pro-Axis ''[[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]]'' in the north until the end of the war. When Italy was made a republic by referendum, the air force was given its current name ''Aeronautica Militare''.\n\n===Carabinieri===\n{{Main article|Carabinieri}}\n\nThe ''[[Arma dei Carabinieri]]'' is the [[gendarmerie]] and [[military police]] of Italy. The corps was instituted in 1814 by King Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy with the aim of providing the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] with a police corps; it is therefore older than Italy itself. The new force was divided into divisions on the scale of one division for each [[province of Italy]]. The divisions were further divided into companies and subdivided into lieutenancies, which commanded and coordinated the local [[police station]]s and were distributed throughout the national territory in direct contact with the public. The [[Italian unification]] saw the number of divisions increased, and in 1861 the ''Carabinieri'' were appointed the \"First Force\" of the new national military organization. In recent years ''Carabinieri'' units have been dispatched on peacekeeping missions, including [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. At the [[Sea Island, Georgia|Sea Islands Conference]] of the [[G8]] in 2004, the Carabinieri were given the mandate to establish a [[Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units]] ([[CoESPU]]) to spearhead the development of training and doctrinal standards for civilian police units attached to international peacekeeping missions.<ref>[http://coespu.carabinieri.it/NR/rdonlyres/4F54A33F-675A-4F65-9A59-069F73B1F71E/2085/G8_Action_Plan_EN.pdf G-8 Action Plan: Expanding global capability for peace support operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009150602/http://coespu.carabinieri.it/NR/rdonlyres/4F54A33F-675A-4F65-9A59-069F73B1F71E/2085/G8_Action_Plan_EN.pdf |date=2010-10-09 }}. [[Carabinieri]], June 2004.</ref>\n\n==International stance==\n[[File:Sassari Brigade on patrol, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|Italian soldiers of the [[Mechanized Brigade \"Sassari\"]] in Afghanistan in 2012]]\n\nItaly has joined in many [[United Nations|UN]], [[NATO]] and [[EU]] operations as well as with assistance to [[Russia]] and the other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] nations, [[Middle East]] peace process, [[peacekeeping]], and combating the [[illegal drug trade]], [[human trafficking]], piracy and terrorism.\n\nItaly did take part in the 1982 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]] along with US, French and British troops. Italy also participated in the 1990\u201391 [[Gulf War]], with the deployment of eight Panavia Tornado IDS bomber jets; Italian Army troops were subsequently deployed to assist [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] refugees in northern [[Iraq]] following the conflict.\n\nAs part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], Italy contributed to the international operation in [[Afghanistan]]. Italian forces have contributed to [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], the NATO force in [[Afghanistan]], and to the [[Provincial reconstruction team]]. Italy has sent 3,800 troops, including one infantry company from the [[2 Alpini Regiment|2nd Alpini Regiment]] tasked to protect the ISAF HQ, one engineer company, one NBC platoon, one logistic unit, as well as liaison and staff elements integrated into the operation [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. Italian forces also command a multinational engineer task force and have deployed a platoon of Carabinieri [[military police]].\n\nThe Italian Army did not take part in combat operations of the 2003 [[Iraq War]], dispatching troops only when major combat operations were declared over by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Subsequently, Italian troops arrived in the late summer of 2003, and began patrolling [[Nasiriyah]] and the surrounding area. Italian participation in the military operations in Iraq was concluded by the end of 2006, with full withdrawal of Italian military personnel except for a small group of about 30 soldiers engaged in providing security for the Italian embassy in [[Baghdad]]. Italy played a major role in the 2004-2011 [[NATO Training Mission \u2013 Iraq|NATO Training Mission]] to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions.\n\n===Operations===\n[[File:Italian Armed Forces operations.png|thumb|450px|Current operations of the Italian Armed Forces highlighted on a map of [[Afro-Eurasia]]]]\nSince the second [[post-war]] the Italian armed force has become more and more engaged in international peace support operations, mainly under the auspices of the United Nations.

Army]], the [[Italian Navy]] and the [[Italian Air Force]]. A fourth branch of the armed forces, known as the [[Carabinieri]], take on the role as the nation's [[Gendarmerie|military police]] and are also involved in missions and operations abroad as a combat force. Despite not being a branch of the armed forces, the [[Guardia di Finanza]] is part of the military and operates a large fleet of ships, aircraft and helicopters, enabling it to patrol Italy's waters and to eventually participate in warfare scenarios. These five forces have military status and are all organized along military lines, comprising a total of 341,250 men and women with the official status of active military personnel, of which 165,500 are in the Army, Navy and Air Force.{{sfn|IISS|2020|p=118}}<ref name=\"Budget2014\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=koG-2k__pIcC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=Guardia+di+finanza,+military&source=bl&ots=8aDACPMwS5&sig=e9roxGPwjMI7mziEpt-EhSdJw30&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0CDQQ6AEwCWoVChMI_aSItab2yAIVi10UCh1E2w2o#v=onepage&q=Guardia+di+finanza,+military&f=false|title=Armed Forces in Law Enforcement Operations? - The German and European Perspective|first=Kim Eduard|last=Lioe|date=25 November 2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=hYiIWVlpFzEC&pg=PA560&lpg=PA560&dq=Guardi+di+finanz+status+of+troops&source=bl&ots=R7dXKL-HQV&sig=PxgWNUiFagfsqR7pBDB7KD_rARI&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBWoVChMIkZDZ26_2yAIVx-wUCh1yIwZs#v=onepage&q=Guardi+di+finanz+status+of+troops&f=false|title=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law - 2010|first1=M.

It fought in colonial engagements in China during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Italo-Turkish War|Libya (1911-1912)]], on the [[Alps]] against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] during [[World War I]], in [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] during the [[Interwar period]], and in [[World War II]] in [[Albania]], [[Greece]], [[North Africa]] and [[Russia]], as well as in the [[Italian Civil War]]. During the [[Cold War]] the Army prepared itself to defend against a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion from the east. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it has seen extensive peacekeeping service in [[Lebanon]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. On 29 July 2004 it became a professional all-volunteer force when [[conscription]] was finally ended.\n\n===Marina Militare===\n{{Main article|Italian Navy}}\n\nThe navy of Italy was created in 1861, following the [[proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy]], as the ''[[Regia Marina]]''. The new navy's baptism of fire came during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] against the [[Austrian Empire]]. During the [[First World War]], it spent its major efforts in the [[Adriatic Sea]], fighting the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. In the [[Second World War]], it engaged the [[Royal Navy]] in a two-and-a-half-year struggle for the control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. After the war, the new ''Marina Militare'', being a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), has taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations.It is a [[blue-water navy]]. The ''[[Guardia Costiera]]'' (Coast Guard) is a component of the navy.\n\n===Aeronautica Militare===\n{{Main article|Italian Air Force}}\n\nThe [[air force]] of Italy was founded as an independent service arm on 28 March 1923, by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Vittorio Emanuele III]] as the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (which equates to \"Royal Air Force\"). During the 1930s, it was involved in its first military operations in Ethiopia in 1935, and later in the [[Spanish Civil War]] between 1936 and 1939. Eventually, Italy entered [[World War II]] alongside Germany. After the armistice of 8 September 1943, Italy was divided into two sides, and the same fate befell the ''Regia Aeronautica''. The Air Force was split into the ''[[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]]'' in the south aligned with the Allies, and the pro-Axis ''[[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]]'' in the north until the end of the war. When Italy was made a republic by referendum, the air force was given its current name ''Aeronautica Militare''.\n\n===Carabinieri===\n{{Main article|Carabinieri}}\n\nThe ''[[Arma dei Carabinieri]]'' is the [[gendarmerie]] and [[military police]] of Italy. The corps was instituted in 1814 by King Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy with the aim of providing the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] with a police corps; it is therefore older than Italy itself. The new force was divided into divisions on the scale of one division for each [[province of Italy]]. The divisions were further divided into companies and subdivided into lieutenancies, which commanded and coordinated the local [[police station]]s and were distributed throughout the national territory in direct contact with the public. The [[Italian unification]] saw the number of divisions increased, and in 1861 the ''Carabinieri'' were appointed the \"First Force\" of the new national military organization. In recent years ''Carabinieri'' units have been dispatched on peacekeeping missions, including [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. At the [[Sea Island, Georgia|Sea Islands Conference]] of the [[G8]] in 2004, the Carabinieri were given the mandate to establish a [[Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units]] ([[CoESPU]]) to spearhead the development of training and doctrinal standards for civilian police units attached to international peacekeeping missions.<ref>[http://coespu.carabinieri.it/NR/rdonlyres/4F54A33F-675A-4F65-9A59-069F73B1F71E/2085/G8_Action_Plan_EN.pdf G-8 Action Plan: Expanding global capability for peace support operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009150602/http://coespu.carabinieri.it/NR/rdonlyres/4F54A33F-675A-4F65-9A59-069F73B1F71E/2085/G8_Action_Plan_EN.pdf |date=2010-10-09 }}.

Italy also participated in the 1990\u201391 [[Gulf War]], with the deployment of eight Panavia Tornado IDS bomber jets; Italian Army troops were subsequently deployed to assist [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] refugees in northern [[Iraq]] following the conflict.\n\nAs part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], Italy contributed to the international operation in [[Afghanistan]]. Italian forces have contributed to [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], the NATO force in [[Afghanistan]], and to the [[Provincial reconstruction team]]. Italy has sent 3,800 troops, including one infantry company from the [[2 Alpini Regiment|2nd Alpini Regiment]] tasked to protect the ISAF HQ, one engineer company, one NBC platoon, one logistic unit, as well as liaison and staff elements integrated into the operation [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. Italian forces also command a multinational engineer task force and have deployed a platoon of Carabinieri [[military police]].\n\nThe Italian Army did not take part in combat operations of the 2003 [[Iraq War]], dispatching troops only when major combat operations were declared over by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Subsequently, Italian troops arrived in the late summer of 2003, and began patrolling [[Nasiriyah]] and the surrounding area. Italian participation in the military operations in Iraq was concluded by the end of 2006, with full withdrawal of Italian military personnel except for a small group of about 30 soldiers engaged in providing security for the Italian embassy in [[Baghdad]]. Italy played a major role in the 2004-2011 [[NATO Training Mission \u2013 Iraq|NATO Training Mission]] to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions.\n\n===Operations===\n[[File:Italian Armed Forces operations.png|thumb|450px|Current operations of the Italian Armed Forces highlighted on a map of [[Afro-Eurasia]]]]\nSince the second [[post-war]] the Italian armed force has become more and more engaged in international peace support operations, mainly under the auspices of the United Nations.

It also provides student representation and support, a student magazine, a student shop and a bar. Birkbeck students also have access to the societies and clubs of the [[Student Central]], whose building adjoins Birkbeck's Bloomsbury site.\n\n== History ==\nBirkbeck Students' Union was founded in 1904, making it one of the oldest Students' Unions in the world.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb1832-bbk/bbk/11/2|title=Students' Union Records - Birkbeck College: Student Societies and Students' Union records - Birkbeck College archive - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1922, it was one of the founding members of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]].\n\nSince its foundation, the Students' Union has been rather atypical of other students' unions in the UK, with a reduced focus on commercial activities, and greater focus on political lobbying on behalf of its members.\n\nIn 1956, the Students' Union housed 50 Hungarian refugees, fleeing the conflict of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/students-prepare-home-for-hungarians/query/wildcard|title=Students Prepare Home For Hungarians|last=Path\u00e9|first=British|website=www.britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation ==\nInitially governed by a Council, elected from and responsible to the students, today it is governed jointly by a Student Council, Executive Committee, Board of Trustees and Clubs & Societies Committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/your-union/governance|title=Governance @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/articles/democracy-review-update|title=Democracy Review update! @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Under the Royal Charter granted to the College in 1926, the Students' Union appoints two Governors to the Governing Body of the university each year, from among its sabbatical officers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Students initially paid an annual membership fee to join, but students are now automatically registered as members when they enrol onto a course at the university.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/your-union/governance/membership|title=Membership @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The Students' Union is led by 6 [[Sabbatical officer|sabbatical officers]] comprised of two Students' Union Leaders, a Women's Officer, a Disabled Students' Officer, a Black Students' Officer, a LGBTQ+ Students' Officer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/your-union/your-su-team/union-officers|title=Union Officers @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, the Students' Union expanded this to include a seventh sabbatical officer, its Trans' Students' Officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Lamp and Owl Magazine ==\nThe college arms include a [[Oil lamp|lamp]] and an [[owl]], symbolising the college's motto '''In nocte consilium''<nowiki/>' (translated as \"study by night\"). Because of this, the student magazine was called ''Lamp and Owl''. Its name was changed in 2010 to 'Lampanelle', and after an 18-month hiatus returned in February 2012 with the name having reverted to The Lamp And Owl.\n\nThe original name of the institution was the London Mechanics' Institute. For this reason, the annual literary magazine published by the Birkbeck MA Creative Writing programme is called [[The Mechanics' Institute Review|Mechanics' Institute Review]].\n\n== University Challenge ==\nThe college has entered teams in ''[[University Challenge]]'' over the years, with varied results. In 1997, a team scored just 40 points \u2013 at that stage the lowest score since the series had been revived, though this has since been broken by [[New Hall, Cambridge]], the [[University of Bradford]] and the ''University Challenge: The Professionals'' team of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref name=\"UCstats\">[[New Hall, Cambridge]] in 1998 and [[University of Bradford]] in 2004 both scored 35 points. In the special series 'University Challenge: The Professionals', the [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] achieved 25 points \u2013 the lowest score in the modern era. The score of 40 has also been achieved by [[Oxford Brookes University]] (1998), the [[University of St Andrews]] (2002 & 2005), [[Keele University]] (2002) and [[Queen's University Belfast]] (2005). Statistics for the original incarnation of the series are not known, though the lowest score achieved was by the [[University of Sussex]] in 1972 with a score of 10. {{cite web|url=http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/stats_lowscore.html|title=University Challenge \u2013 Lowest Scores|work=Sean Blanchflower's University Challenge Page|accessdate=18 November 2006}}</ref> 1998 saw a reversal of fortunes when Birkbeck reached the final, losing to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. In 2003, Birkbeck again reached the final, facing another team of mature students from [[Cranfield University]].

Blanchflower.org. Retrieved 17 July 2013.</ref>\n\n== Mooting ==\nBirkbeck's School of Law actively competes in national and international [[Moot court|mooting competitions]] of simulated court proceedings. At the 2012 [[Inner Temple]] Inter-Varsity Moot Birkbeck went through to the quarter-finals, being selected as one of the final eight teams of the 32 UK Universities (64 teams) which competed for the prestigious Inner Temple award. In 2012 Birkbeck was entered in the prized [[University of Oxford]]-based Price Moot Competition and finished within the top 15 Law Schools in the competition. The competition draws Law Schools from universities all around the world and focuses on international law.\n\n== Former Officers ==\nNotable former officers include:\n\n*[[Rabbi|Rabbi Eli Goldsobel]], Leader 2017-18, first Rabbi to serve as a sabbatical officer in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/four-jewish-students-including-a-rabbi-win-nominations-for-nus-elections/|title=Four Jewish students, including a rabbi, win nominations for NUS elections|website=jewishnews.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External Links ==\nhttps://www.birkbeckunion.org/\n\n[[Category:Birkbeck, University of London]]\n[[Category:Students' unions in England]]\n", "text_old": "[[Category:Birkbeck, University of London]]\n[[Category:Students' unions in England]]\n{{Infobox students' union|name=Birkbeck Students' Union|members={{circa}} 12,000 total|institution=[[Birkbeck, University of London]]|homepage=[https://www.birkbeckunion.org/ www.birkbeckunion.org]|location=[[London]], England, United Kingdom|sabbs=Alex Holmes (Leader)<br />\nBarney O'Connor (Leader)<br />|established={{start date and age|1904}}}}\n\n'''Birkbeck Students' Union''' (commonly known as '''Birkbeck Union''') is the representative body for students at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], a [[Public Research University|public research university]] located in [[Bloomsbury]], London, England.\n\nAs Birkbeck primarily offers part-time courses, often in the evenings, student life is less centralised than in other universities.

Birkbeck students also have access to the societies and clubs of the [[Student Central]], whose building adjoins Birkbeck's Bloomsbury site.\n\n== History ==\nBirkbeck Students' Union was founded in 1904, making it one of the oldest Students' Unions in the world.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb1832-bbk/bbk/11/2|title=Students' Union Records - Birkbeck College: Student Societies and Students' Union records - Birkbeck College archive - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1922, it was one of the founding members of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]].\n\nSince its foundation, the Students' Union has been rather atypical of other students' unions in the UK, with a reduced focus on commercial activities, and greater focus on political lobbying on behalf of its members.\n\nIn 1956, the Students' Union housed 50 Hungarian refugees, fleeing the conflict of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/students-prepare-home-for-hungarians/query/wildcard|title=Students Prepare Home For Hungarians|last=Path\u00e9|first=British|website=www.britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== Organisation ==\nInitially governed by a Council, elected from and responsible to the students, today it is governed jointly by a Student Council, Executive Committee, Board of Trustees and Clubs & Societies Committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/your-union/governance|title=Governance @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/articles/democracy-review-update|title=Democracy Review update! @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Under the Royal Charter granted to the College in 1926, the Students' Union appoints two Governors to the Governing Body of the university each year, from among its sabbatical officers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Students initially paid an annual membership fee to join, but students are now automatically registered as members when they enrol onto a course at the university.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/your-union/governance/membership|title=Membership @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The Students' Union is led by 6 [[Sabbatical officer|sabbatical officers]] comprised of two Students' Union Leaders, a Women's Officer, a Disabled Students' Officer, a Black Students' Officer, a LGBTQ+ Students' Officer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birkbeckunion.org/your-union/your-su-team/union-officers|title=Union Officers @ Birkbeck Students' Union|website=www.birkbeckunion.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, the Students' Union expanded this to include a seventh sabbatical officer, its Trans' Students' Officer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Lamp and Owl Magazine ==\nThe college arms include a [[Oil lamp|lamp]] and an [[owl]], symbolising the college's motto '''In nocte consilium''<nowiki/>' (translated as \"study by night\"). Because of this, the student magazine was called ''Lamp and Owl''. Its name was changed in 2010 to 'Lampanelle', and after an 18-month hiatus returned in February 2012 with the name having reverted to The Lamp And Owl.\n\nThe original name of the institution was the London Mechanics' Institute. For this reason, the annual literary magazine published by the Birkbeck MA Creative Writing programme is called [[The Mechanics' Institute Review|Mechanics' Institute Review]].\n\n== University Challenge ==\nThe college has entered teams in ''[[University Challenge]]'' over the years, with varied results. In 1997, a team scored just 40 points \u2013 at that stage the lowest score since the series had been revived, though this has since been broken by [[New Hall, Cambridge]], the [[University of Bradford]] and the ''University Challenge: The Professionals'' team of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref name=\"UCstats\">[[New Hall, Cambridge]] in 1998 and [[University of Bradford]] in 2004 both scored 35 points. In the special series 'University Challenge: The Professionals', the [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] achieved 25 points \u2013 the lowest score in the modern era. The score of 40 has also been achieved by [[Oxford Brookes University]] (1998), the [[University of St Andrews]] (2002 & 2005), [[Keele University]] (2002) and [[Queen's University Belfast]] (2005). Statistics for the original incarnation of the series are not known, though the lowest score achieved was by the [[University of Sussex]] in 1972 with a score of 10. {{cite web|url=http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/stats_lowscore.html|title=University Challenge \u2013 Lowest Scores|work=Sean Blanchflower's University Challenge Page|accessdate=18 November 2006}}</ref> 1998 saw a reversal of fortunes when Birkbeck reached the final, losing to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. In 2003, Birkbeck again reached the final, facing another team of mature students from [[Cranfield University]]. On this occasion, Birkbeck won University Challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/04_april/01/university_birkbeck.shtml|title=BBC - Press Office - Birkbeck College win University Challenge|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn the past two decades Birkbeck, University of London has consistently done well in University Challenge, ranked among the best since the TV series was revived with [[Jeremy Paxman]].<ref>[http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/extras_ranking.html University Challenge \u2013 All-time rankings].

At the 2012 [[Inner Temple]] Inter-Varsity Moot Birkbeck went through to the quarter-finals, being selected as one of the final eight teams of the 32 UK Universities (64 teams) which competed for the prestigious Inner Temple award. In 2012 Birkbeck was entered in the prized [[University of Oxford]]-based Price Moot Competition and finished within the top 15 Law Schools in the competition. The competition draws Law Schools from universities all around the world and focuses on international law.\n\n== Former Officers ==\nNotable former officers include:\n\n*[[Rabbi|Rabbi Eli Goldsobel]], Leader 2017-18, first Rabbi to serve as a sabbatical officer in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/four-jewish-students-including-a-rabbi-win-nominations-for-nus-elections/|title=Four Jewish students, including a rabbi, win nominations for NUS elections|website=jewishnews.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External Links ==\nhttps://www.birkbeckunion.org/\n", "name_user": "Crow", "label": "safe", "comment": "mv cats to the end", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkbeck_Students%27_Union"}

Years after working on ''Thunderbirds'', Rimmer, along with fellow Anderson associate [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]], retained a solicitor.
