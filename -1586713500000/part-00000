He debuted in ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' as a hidden opponent; it was the first fighting game to introduce a secret fighter, reached if the player fulfilled a set of requirements. He appeared in subsequent titles as a playable character, also appearing in the merchandise and other media related to the series.\n\nReptile is a Zaterran, a nearly-extinct [[bipedal]] [[Reptilian humanoid|humanoid race of reptilian creatures]] and loyally serves the series' recurring villain [[Shao Kahn]] in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has been featured in almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 reboot]], he had yet to be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.\n\n==Conception and history==\n[[File:MK4 Reptile.png|thumb|left|upright|Originally a [[palette swap]] of [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], Reptile's design evolved as the series progressed.]]\n\nIncluded in the first game late in the development process, Reptile's character concept was conceived while Boon was driving back to work from lunch.

Boon noted in a later interview that due to the popularity of the rumors surrounding the character, they decided to include Reptile in subsequent installments of the series as a playable fighter.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat 3]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=1995 |level=Ed Boon and John Tobias interview}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nReptile was originally depicted as a tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] and [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small [[Faulds (plate armour)|fauld]] and loincloth.<ref name=\"Kent\" /> He wears a green facial mask as part of his [[ninja]] disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his acid spit attack (which was [[Daniel Pesina]]'s idea inspired by an episode of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-mortal-kombat|title=An Oral History of 'Mortal Kombat'|date=2018-11-26|website=MEL Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>) or his tongue grab Fatality.<ref name=\"UMK3\">{{cite book |author=Wartow, Ronald |title=Official Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Fighter's Kompanion|year=1996 |publisher=[[BradyGames]]|page=370 |isbn=1-56686-639-1}}</ref> Reptile stands 6&nbsp;feet (183&nbsp;cm) tall,<ref name=\"dabiocard\" /> and speaks in a hissing tone.<ref name=\"mkad\" />\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', Reptile's appearance became more reptilian, with his head completely uncovered. His hands became clawed, while his feet were now three-toed talons.<ref name=\"mk4end\" /> By ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance|Deadly Alliance]]'', Reptile had developed a full reptilian head and tail, with gold and black armor to cover his legs, elbows, shoulders, and belt, and he was completely barefoot. Bone spurs extended from the base of his skull down his spine, ending at the tip of his tail, while a similar spur extended from his heel on each bare foot.<ref name=\"dabiocard\" /> Ed Boon described the changes to Reptile's design over the course of the two games as hinting at him \"evolving into a bigger character\", and foreshadowing Onaga controlling his body in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception|Deception]]''.<ref name=\"mkad2\" />\n\nReptile's appearance in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks|Shaolin Monks]]'' used an amalgam of his three previous designs, intended by character designer Mark Lappin to portray a classic yet fresh feel for the character.<ref name=\"devd\" /> The design incorporated the appearance of his body from ''Mortal Kombat 4'', his clothing from the original ''Mortal Kombat'', and the look of his bare feet, hands, and armor from ''Deadly Alliance''.

His character now has actual dialogue, mostly speaking through hisses and grunts. Reptile fights for Outworld against Earthrealm in the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament. He battles Johnny Cage during the first match of the tournament, but is defeated. After the end of the tournament, Reptile, Baraka, and Kitana bring Shang Tsung to Shao Kahn, the Emperor of Outworld, to stand trial for his failure to merge the realms. Reptile makes another appearance during the second Mortal Kombat tournament, whispering to Shang Tsung something inaudible, which pleases the sorcerer. \nReptile is next seen in the Living Forest. While Kano and Shang Tsung prepare to make a deal over the Black Dragon firearms, Smoke interrupts. After Smoke defeats Kano, Shang Tsung morphs into the elder Sub-Zero and teams up with Reptile to face Smoke in a two-on-one fight. Smoke defeats both Reptile and Shang Tsung. \nWhen the younger Sub-Zero demands to face Scorpion, he is instead forced into a duel with Reptile, and emerges victorious against the reptilian ninja. Reptile then appears during the Earthrealm invasion, scaling a building which police officers Kurtis Stryker and Kabal are on top of. Reptile dodges all of the bullets fired at him, and spits acid at Kabal, incapacitating him. Stryker then battles Reptile and defeats him. After losing to Stryker, he is not seen again.\n\nReptile returns in the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' video game as a playable character. Unlike the previous game, Reptile is now capable of speaking and plays an instrumental role in overthrowing Mileena as the Empress of Outworld. Five years before the story, Reptile seems to be the first ally to Kotal Kahn, and the two approach D'Vorah asking her to assist them in overthrowing the Empress Mileena. Moments later, Mileena, Ermac, Baraka and several Tarkartan soldiers enter the room and confront the trio, accusing them of treason and sedition. Reptile then reveals to the room that he saw how Mileena was constructed in Shang Tsung's Flesh Pits and is not actually Shao Kahn's daughter, and is therefore not the rightful heir to the throne. Outraged by Reptile's outburst, Mileena orders her men to kill the usurpers. However, Ermac soon betrays Mileena and joins the usurpers. After D'Vorah kills Baraka and the rest defeat the other Tarkartans, Kotal orders Mileena to be locked up and thus begins his reign as the new emperor of Outworld with Reptile serving as one of his enforcers. Reptile, along with Erron Black and Ermac, is next seen investigating the bodies left by D'Vorah after she betrayed Outworld by stealing Shinnok's amulet. Cassie Cage, Jacqui Briggs, Takeda Takahashi, and Kung Jin escaped captivity but are quickly located by Reptile's superior smelling senses. The Earthrealm warriors begin an ambush, as Cassie and Jacqui fight Erron and Ermac, Takeda fights Reptile who uses his invisibility to fight him, but Takeda uses his telepathy to locate him before he strikes. Reptile and his comrades are then incapacitated by the Earthrealmers. The three go to Kotal Kahn and report that D'Vorah is gone with the amulet and they believe that she is also working with Earthrealm. Furious with this news, Kahn declares war on Earthrealm and tells his men to ready the army. Kotal Kahn, Reptile, Ermac, Ferra/Torr, and Erron Black then lead dozens of soldiers through a portal to Earthrealm and meet up with the four Earthrealmers who happened to crash land in that area. The Earthrealmers run away from the army and ambush the Outworld Army. Reptile quickly dodges most of the attacks and climbs the trees and pounces on Jacqui. Takeda attempts to stop him, but Reptile ends up spitting his acid in his face, temporarily blinding him. Jacqui breaks free of Reptile's grasp and defeats him. However the Earthrealmers are overrun by the superior number of the Outworld army. Kotal Kahn announces that he shall have their heads as a peace treaty for Shinnok to spare Outworld. All of a sudden, the Lin Kuei, led by Sub-Zero attack the army, allowing the four teammates to escape. \n\nReptile makes a cameo appearance in [[Mortal Kombat 11]], where he runs away from the player in the Krypt.\n\n===Other media===\n[[Image:Reptile-MK-movie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Cooke]] as Reptile in the film ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'']]\n\nReptile appears as a minor character in several of [[Malibu Comics]]' ''Mortal Kombat'' comic book series released in 1995, debuting in the ''Goro: Prince of Pain'' miniseries as a member of a team led by Kitana to find the missing [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]],<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Charles Marshall | inker = Bruce McCorkindale | penciller = Kiki Chansamone | story = Armed and Dangerous | title = [[Mortal Kombat (comics)#Comics published by Malibu|Mortal Kombat - Goro: Prince of Pain]] | issue = 3 | date = 1995 | publisher = [[Malibu Comics]] | location = [[Calabasas, California]]}}</ref> later appearing in the ''Battlewave'' miniseries hypnotizing [[Sonya Blade]] into wanting to marry Shao Kahn,<ref name=\"malibu\">Marshall, Charles (1996).

He appeared in subsequent titles as a playable character, also appearing in the merchandise and other media related to the series.\n\nReptile is a Zaterran, a nearly-extinct [[bipedal]] [[Reptilian humanoid|humanoid race of reptilian creatures]] and loyally serves the series' recurring villain [[Shao Kahn]] in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has been featured in almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|2011 reboot]], he had yet to be rewarded for his efforts.

His character now has actual dialogue, mostly speaking through hisses and grunts. Reptile fights for Outworld against Earthrealm in the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament. He battles Johnny Cage during the first match of the tournament, but is defeated. After the end of the tournament, Reptile, Baraka, and Kitana bring Shang Tsung to Shao Kahn, the Emperor of Outworld, to stand trial for his failure to merge the realms. Reptile makes another appearance during the second Mortal Kombat tournament, whispering to Shang Tsung something inaudible, which pleases the sorcerer. \nReptile is next seen in the Living Forest. While Kano and Shang Tsung prepare to make a deal over the Black Dragon firearms, Smoke interrupts. After Smoke defeats Kano, Shang Tsung morphs into the elder Sub-Zero and teams up with Reptile to face Smoke in a two-on-one fight. Smoke defeats both Reptile and Shang Tsung. \nWhen the younger Sub-Zero demands to face Scorpion, he is instead forced into a duel with Reptile, and emerges victorious against the reptilian ninja. Reptile then appears during the Earthrealm invasion, scaling a building which police officers Kurtis Stryker and Kabal are on top of. Reptile dodges all of the bullets fired at him, and spits acid at Kabal, incapacitating him. Stryker then battles Reptile and defeats him. After losing to Stryker, he is not seen again.\n\nReptile returns in the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' video game as a playable character. Unlike the previous game, Reptile is now capable of speaking and plays an instrumental role in overthrowing Mileena as the Empress of Outworld. Five years before the story, Reptile seems to be the first ally to Kotal Kahn, and the two approach D'Vorah asking her to assist them in overthrowing the Empress Mileena. Moments later, Mileena, Ermac, Baraka and several Tarkartan soldiers enter the room and confront the trio, accusing them of treason and sedition. Reptile then reveals to the room that he saw how Mileena was constructed in Shang Tsung's Flesh Pits and is not actually Shao Kahn's daughter, and is therefore not the rightful heir to the throne. Outraged by Reptile's outburst, Mileena orders her men to kill the usurpers. However, Ermac soon betrays Mileena and joins the usurpers. After D'Vorah kills Baraka and the rest defeat the other Tarkartans, Kotal orders Mileena to be locked up and thus begins his reign as the new emperor of Outworld with Reptile serving as one of his enforcers. Reptile, along with Erron Black and Ermac, is next seen investigating the bodies left by D'Vorah after she betrayed Outworld by stealing Shinnok's amulet. Cassie Cage, Jacqui Briggs, Takeda Takahashi, and Kung Jin escaped captivity but are quickly located by Reptile's superior smelling senses. The Earthrealm warriors begin an ambush, as Cassie and Jacqui fight Erron and Ermac, Takeda fights Reptile who uses his invisibility to fight him, but Takeda uses his telepathy to locate him before he strikes. Reptile and his comrades are then incapacitated by the Earthrealmers. The three go to Kotal Kahn and report that D'Vorah is gone with the amulet and they believe that she is also working with Earthrealm. Furious with this news, Kahn declares war on Earthrealm and tells his men to ready the army. Kotal Kahn, Reptile, Ermac, Ferra/Torr, and Erron Black then lead dozens of soldiers through a portal to Earthrealm and meet up with the four Earthrealmers who happened to crash land in that area. The Earthrealmers run away from the army and ambush the Outworld Army. Reptile quickly dodges most of the attacks and climbs the trees and pounces on Jacqui. Takeda attempts to stop him, but Reptile ends up spitting his acid in his face, temporarily blinding him. Jacqui breaks free of Reptile's grasp and defeats him. However the Earthrealmers are overrun by the superior number of the Outworld army. Kotal Kahn announces that he shall have their heads as a peace treaty for Shinnok to spare Outworld. All of a sudden, the Lin Kuei, led by Sub-Zero attack the army, allowing the four teammates to escape. \n\nReptile makes a cameo appearance in [[Mortal Kombat 11]], where he runs away from the player in the Krypt.\n\n===Other media===\n[[Image:Reptile-MK-movie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Cooke]] as Reptile in the film ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'']]\n\nReptile appears as a minor character in several of [[Malibu Comics]]' ''Mortal Kombat'' comic book series released in 1995, debuting in the ''Goro: Prince of Pain'' miniseries as a member of a team led by Kitana to find the missing [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]],<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = Charles Marshall | inker = Bruce McCorkindale | penciller = Kiki Chansamone | story = Armed and Dangerous | title = [[Mortal Kombat (comics)#Comics published by Malibu|Mortal Kombat - Goro: Prince of Pain]] | issue = 3 | date = 1995 | publisher = [[Malibu Comics]] | location = [[Calabasas, California]]}}</ref> later appearing in the ''Battlewave'' miniseries hypnotizing [[Sonya Blade]] into wanting to marry Shao Kahn,<ref name=\"malibu\">Marshall, Charles (1996).
