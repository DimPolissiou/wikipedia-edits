It sold over 100,000 a year in the US, and was awarded the ''[[Consumers Digest]]'' \"Best Buy\" award.

It used the same unibody platform and many of the same components as the [[Chevrolet Equinox]], [[Pontiac Torrent]], [[Saturn Vue]] and [[Opel Antara]] but incorporated third row seating exclusive to the Suzuki. The second generation model used a version of the [[GM High Feature engine]]\u2014designated ''N36A'' by Suzuki\u2014built in Japan and shipped to [[CAMI Automotive]] in [[Ingersoll, Ontario]], Canada, where the XL7 was assembled with the Equinox and Torrent. Styling cues on the 2007 model include a chrome slotted grille and trapezoidal headlights. It  no longer has the spare tire mounted on the rear door.\n\n[[File:Suzuki XL7 Hill Climb Special.jpg|thumb|left|Suzuki XL7 of [[Nobuhiro Tajima]] at the 2007 [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]] during the record breaking run]]\n\nFrom its introduction in 2007 until its discontinuation in 2009, the second-generation [[Suzuki]] XL7 was available in five trim levels: Base (2007-08 only), Special (2007 only), Premium (2008-2009 only), Luxury (2007-2009), and Limited (2007-2009). Depending upon the trim level selected, both two-row, five-passenger seating and XL7 specific three-row, seven-passenger seating (the related [[Chevrolet Equinox]] and [[Pontiac Torrent]] did not offer third-row seating as an option). All XL7's came decently-equipped, and depending upon the trim level selected, could be equipped with options such as a premium audio system with a subwoofer and an amplifier, faux wood interior trim, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power-adjustable and heated dual front bucket seats, remote start, a security system, chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, a power sunroof, a [[Bluetooth]] hands-free phone system (2009 models only), a single-disc, CD/MP3 player audio system, a six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer audio system, a touchscreen [[GPS]] navigation system with [[SiriusXM]] Nav Traffic, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], and a rear backup camera system, among other options. Unlike the related [[Chevrolet Equinox]] and [[Pontiac Torrent]], the [[General Motors]] (GM) [[OnStar]] in-vehicle [[telematics]] system was not available on the XL7. \n\nAll second-generation XL7's were powered by the [[General Motors]] (GM) High-Feature ''[[GM High Feature engine#N36A|N36A]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] producing 252 horsepower and 243 lb. ft. of torque. While 2007 and 2008 models used a five-speed [[automatic transmission]], 2009 models received a new six-speed [[automatic transmission]]. Both [[Front Wheel Drive]] (FWD) and [[All Wheel Drive]] (AWD) models of the XL7 were available. \n\nIn May 2009, Suzuki halted production of the XL7 indefinitely due to low demand.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Jeffrey N. |date=2009-05-13 |url=http://www.autotropolis.com/auto-industry-news/suzuki-halts-production-of-xl7-crossover.html |title=Suzuki Halts Production of XL7 Crossover |publisher=Autotropolis.com |accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref> Through May 10, 2009, [[CAMI Automotive|CAMI Automotive Inc.]] had only produced four XL7s for Suzuki after producing more than 12,000 units the previous year. While no direct replacement to the three-row XL7 was available ([[General Motors]] offered the larger [[Buick Enclave]], [[Chevrolet Traverse]], and [[GMC Acadia]] midsize three-row crossover SUV's), the [[Chevrolet Equinox]] and [[GMC Terrain]] were considered the successors to the two-row XL7.

Moshoeshoe and his agemates went to initiation school and  he got the name Letlama meaning strong bond. During his youth just after initiation, he was very brave and once organised a cattle raid against Ramonaheng and captured several herds. As was the tradition, he composed a poem praising himself where, amongst the words he used to refer to himself, said he was \"like a razor which has shaved all Ramonaheng's beards\", referring to his successful raid. In Sesotho language, a razor [[onomatopoeia|is said to make a \"shoe...shoe...\" sound]], and after that he was affectionately called Moshoeshoe: \"the shaver\". He also referred himself as the person of Kali, thus showed that he was a descendant of the Great Kali or Monaheng who is said to be the ancestor of most Bakoena people in Lesotho with the exception of the senior Bamolibeli.\n\nMoshoeshoe and his followers, mostly the Bakoena Bamokoteli, some Bafokeng from his maternal side and other relations as well as some clans including the Amazizi, established his village at Butha-Buthe, where his settlement and reign coincided with the growth in power of the well-known [[Zulu people|Zulu]] King, [[Shaka]] and what is now known as the 'time of troubles' (previously known as '[[Difaqane]]'). During the early 19th century Shaka raided many smaller chiefdoms along the eastern coast of Southern Africa (modern day [[Kwa-Zulu Natal]]), incorporating parts of them into his steadily growing Zulu chiefdom. Various small clans were forced to flee the Zulu chief.  An era of great wars of calamity followed, known as the ''time of troubles/[[Difaqane]]''. It was marked by aggression against the [[Sotho people]] by the invading [[Nguni people|Nguni clans]]. The attacks also forced Moshoeshoe to move his settlement to the [[Maseru District|Qiloane plateau]]. The name was later changed to [[Thaba Bosiu]] or \"mountain at night\" because it was believed to grow during the night and shrink during day. It proved to be an impassable stronghold against enemies.\n\n== Diplomat ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe most significant role Moshoeshoe played as a diplomat was his acts of friendship towards his beaten enemies. He provided land and protection to various people and this strengthened the growing Basotho nation. His influence and followers grew with the integration of a number of refugees and victims of the wars of calamity.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\nBy the latter part of the 19th century, Moshoeshoe established the nation of the [[Basotho]], in [[Basutoland]]. He was popularly known as ''Morena e Moholo/morena oa Basotho'' (Great King/King of the Basotho).\n\nGuns were introduced with the arrival of the Dutch from the Cape Colony and Moshoeshoe determined that he needed these and a white advisor. From other tribes, he heard of the benefits missionaries brought. By chance, three representatives of the Society arrived in the heart of southern Africa:  {{Interlanguage link multi|Eug\u00e8ne Casalis|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Constant Gosselin|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Arbousset|fr}}. Moshoeshoe brought them to his kingdom. Later [[Roman Catholic]] [[Missionaries]] were to have a great influence on the shape of Basotho History (the first being, Bishop [[Fran\u00e7ois Allard|M.F. Allard]] [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|O.M.I.]] and Fr. [[Joseph G\u00e9rard|Joseph Gerard]] O.M.I.).\n\nFrom 1837 to 1855 Casalis played the role of Moshoeshoe's Foreign Advisor. With his knowledge of the non-African world, he was able to inform and advise the king in his dealings with hostile foreigners. He also served as an interpreter for Moshoeshoe in his dealings with white people, and documented the [[Sesotho language]].\n\nIn the late 1830s, [[Boer]] trekkers from the [[Cape Colony]] showed up on the western borders of [[Basutoland]] and subsequently claimed land rights.\nThe trekkers' pioneer in this area was [[Jan de Winnaar]], who settled in the Matlakeng area in May\u2013June 1838. As more farmers were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers, even north of the [[Caledon River|Caledon]], claiming that it had been \"abandoned\" by the Sotho people.\nMoshoeshoe, when hearing of the trekker settlement above the junction, stated that \"... the ground on which they were belonged to me, but I had no objections to their flocks grazing there until such time as they were able to proceed further; on condition, however, that they remained in peace with my people and recognised my authority.\"\n\nEug\u00e8ne Casalis later remarked that the trekkers had humbly asked for temporary rights while they were still few in number, but that when they felt \"strong enough to throw off the mask\" they went back on their initial intention.\n\nThe next 30 years were marked by conflicts.\n\n== Wars ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nMoshoeshoe signed a treaty with the British Governor, Sir [[George Thomas Napier]].  Among the provisions of this treaty was the annexation of a tract of land (now called the [[Orange River Sovereignty]]) that many Boers had settled.  The outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848, but remained bitter at both the British and the Sotho.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\nThe situation erupted in 1851.  A British force was defeated by the Sotho army at Kolonyama, touching off an embarrassing war for the British.  After repulsing another British attack in 1852, Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that allowed him to save face.  Once again, diplomacy saved the Sotho kingdom.  After a final defeat of the Tloka in 1853, Moshoeshoe reigned supreme.\n\nHowever, the British pulled out of the region in 1854, causing the de facto formation of two independent states: the Boer [[Orange Free State]] and the Sotho Kingdom.\n\nIn 1858 Moshoeshoe defeated the Boers in the [[Free State\u2013Basotho War]] and in 1865 Moshoeshoe lost a great portion of the western lowlands. The last war in 1867 ended only when the British and Moshoeshoe appealed to [[Queen Victoria]], who agreed to make [[Basutoland]] a British protectorate in 1868.  The British were eager to check Boer advances, and Moshoeshoe, with advice from Eugene Casalis, realised that continued pressure from the Boers would lead to the destruction of his kingdom.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\nIn 1869, the British signed a treaty at [[Mossel Bay|Aliwal]] with the Boers. It defined the boundaries of [[Basutoland]] and later Lesotho; those boundaries have not changed. The arable land west of the Caledon River remained in Boer hands, and is referred to as the Lost or Conquered Territory. This effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Grave of King Moshoeshoe I.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Moshoeshoe I atop [[Thaba Bosiu]].]]\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nAlthough he had ceded much territory, Moshoeshoe never suffered a major military defeat and retained most of his kingdom and all of his culture. His death in 1870 marked the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the modern colonial period.  Moshoeshoe Day is a national holiday in Lesotho celebrated every year on 11 March to commemorate the day of Moshoeshoe's death.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\n[[Moshoeshoe I International Airport]] is named in his honour.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\nSouth African-made [[Shweshwe|shweshwe fabric]] is named for King Moshoeshoe I who once received a gift of it and then popularized it throughout his realm.<ref name=Kuper>{{cite news|last=Kuper|first=Jeremy|title=London shows material interest in Africa\u2019s old clothes|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-04-19-london-shows-material-interest-in-africas-old-clothes|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=19 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525031602/http://mg.co.za/article/2013-04-19-london-shows-material-interest-in-africas-old-clothes|archivedate=25 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Holmes>{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=Thalia|title=The fabric of society needs underpinning|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-11-22-00-the-fabric-of-society-needs-underpinning|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=22 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120141942/http://mg.co.za/article/2013-11-22-00-the-fabric-of-society-needs-underpinning|archivedate=20 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn episode two of the American animated series ''[[Animaniacs]]'', the debuting [[Pinky and the Brain]] segment \"Win Big\" referenced Moshoeshoe I briefly when the Brain attempted to win $99,000 on a [[game show|quiz show]] entitled \"Gyp-parody\" so that he might construct a machine that would magnetically hold to the earth any one with loose change in his pockets.

He and his followers settled at the [[Butha-Buthe]] Mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/states/africa/lesotho.html|title=LESOTHO|first=Henry|last=Soszynski|website=members.iinet.net.au|access-date=1 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630221838/http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/states/africa/lesotho.html|archive-date=30 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Great King ==\n[[File:King Moshoeshoe of the Basotho with his ministers.jpg|left|thumb|Moshoeshoe I with his ministers]]\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}Moshoeshoe was the first son of Mokhachane,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/states/africa/lesotho.html |title=Genealogy |access-date=1 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630221838/http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/states/africa/lesotho.html |archive-date=30 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a minor chief of the Bamokoteli sub-clan of the [[Basotho people]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.ug/books?id=q43sCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=Bamokoteli&source=bl&ots=vMbtO6L0CX&sig=E4obX9YOcVVtp7xbFKC4yIvrI0c&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Bamokoteli&f=false|title=Kingdoms and Chiefdoms of Southeastern Africa: Oral Traditions and History, 1400-1830|first=Elizabeth A.|last=Eldredge|date=22 July 2017|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|via=Google Books}}</ref> He was born at Menkhoaneng in Botha-bothe, Lesotho as Lepoqo. Moshoeshoe and his agemates went to initiation school and  he got the name Letlama meaning strong bond. During his youth just after initiation, he was very brave and once organised a cattle raid against Ramonaheng and captured several herds. As was the tradition, he composed a poem praising himself where, amongst the words he used to refer to himself, said he was \"like a razor which has shaved all Ramonaheng's beards\", referring to his successful raid. In Sesotho language, a razor [[onomatopoeia|is said to make a \"shoe...shoe...\" sound]], and after that he was affectionately called Moshoeshoe: \"the shaver\". He also referred himself as the person of Kali, thus showed that he was a descendant of the Great Kali or Monaheng who is said to be the ancestor of most Bakoena people in Lesotho with the exception of the senior Bamolibeli.\n\nMoshoeshoe and his followers, mostly the Bakoena Bamokoteli, some Bafokeng from his maternal side and other relations as well as some clans including the Amazizi, established his village at Butha-Buthe, where his settlement and reign coincided with the growth in power of the well-known [[Zulu people|Zulu]] King, [[Shaka]] and what is now known as the 'time of troubles' (previously known as '[[Difaqane]]'). During the early 19th century Shaka raided many smaller chiefdoms along the eastern coast of Southern Africa (modern day [[Kwa-Zulu Natal]]), incorporating parts of them into his steadily growing Zulu chiefdom. Various small clans were forced to flee the Zulu chief.  An era of great wars of calamity followed, known as the ''time of troubles/[[Difaqane]]''. It was marked by aggression against the [[Sotho people]] by the invading [[Nguni people|Nguni clans]]. The attacks also forced Moshoeshoe to move his settlement to the [[Maseru District|Qiloane plateau]]. The name was later changed to [[Thaba Bosiu]] or \"mountain at night\" because it was believed to grow during the night and shrink during day. It proved to be an impassable stronghold against enemies.\n\n== Diplomat ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe most significant role Moshoeshoe played as a diplomat was his acts of friendship towards his beaten enemies. He provided land and protection to various people and this strengthened the growing Basotho nation. His influence and followers grew with the integration of a number of refugees and victims of the wars of calamity.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\nBy the latter part of the 19th century, Moshoeshoe established the nation of the [[Basotho]], in [[Basutoland]]. He was popularly known as ''Morena e Moholo/morena oa Basotho'' (Great King/King of the Basotho).\n\nGuns were introduced with the arrival of the Dutch from the Cape Colony and Moshoeshoe determined that he needed these and a white advisor. From other tribes, he heard of the benefits missionaries brought. By chance, three representatives of the Society arrived in the heart of southern Africa:  {{Interlanguage link multi|Eug\u00e8ne Casalis|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Constant Gosselin|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Arbousset|fr}}. Moshoeshoe brought them to his kingdom. Later [[Roman Catholic]] [[Missionaries]] were to have a great influence on the shape of Basotho History (the first being, Bishop [[Fran\u00e7ois Allard|M.F. Allard]] [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|O.M.I.]] and Fr. [[Joseph G\u00e9rard|Joseph Gerard]] O.M.I.).\n\nFrom 1837 to 1855 Casalis played the role of Moshoeshoe's Foreign Advisor. With his knowledge of the non-African world, he was able to inform and advise the king in his dealings with hostile foreigners. He also served as an interpreter for Moshoeshoe in his dealings with white people, and documented the [[Sesotho language]].\n\nIn the late 1830s, [[Boer]] trekkers from the [[Cape Colony]] showed up on the western borders of [[Basutoland]] and subsequently claimed land rights.\nThe trekkers' pioneer in this area was [[Jan de Winnaar]], who settled in the Matlakeng area in May\u2013June 1838. As more farmers were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers, even north of the [[Caledon River|Caledon]], claiming that it had been \"abandoned\" by the Sotho people.\nMoshoeshoe, when hearing of the trekker settlement above the junction, stated that \"... the ground on which they were belonged to me, but I had no objections to their flocks grazing there until such time as they were able to proceed further; on condition, however, that they remained in peace with my people and recognised my authority.\"\n\nEug\u00e8ne Casalis later remarked that the trekkers had humbly asked for temporary rights while they were still few in number, but that when they felt \"strong enough to throw off the mask\" they went back on their initial intention.\n\nThe next 30 years were marked by conflicts.\n\n== Wars ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nMoshoeshoe signed a treaty with the British Governor, Sir [[George Thomas Napier]].  Among the provisions of this treaty was the annexation of a tract of land (now called the [[Orange River Sovereignty]]) that many Boers had settled.  The outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848, but remained bitter at both the British and the Sotho.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\nThe situation erupted in 1851.  A British force was defeated by the Sotho army at Kolonyama, touching off an embarrassing war for the British.  After repulsing another British attack in 1852, Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that allowed him to save face.  Once again, diplomacy saved the Sotho kingdom.  After a final defeat of the Tloka in 1853, Moshoeshoe reigned supreme.\n\nHowever, the British pulled out of the region in 1854, causing the de facto formation of two independent states: the Boer [[Orange Free State]] and the Sotho Kingdom.\n\nIn 1858 Moshoeshoe defeated the Boers in the [[Free State\u2013Basotho War]] and in 1865 Moshoeshoe lost a great portion of the western lowlands. The last war in 1867 ended only when the British and Moshoeshoe appealed to [[Queen Victoria]], who agreed to make [[Basutoland]] a British protectorate in 1868.  The British were eager to check Boer advances, and Moshoeshoe, with advice from Eugene Casalis, realised that continued pressure from the Boers would lead to the destruction of his kingdom.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\nIn 1869, the British signed a treaty at [[Mossel Bay|Aliwal]] with the Boers. It defined the boundaries of [[Basutoland]] and later Lesotho; those boundaries have not changed. The arable land west of the Caledon River remained in Boer hands, and is referred to as the Lost or Conquered Territory. This effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Grave of King Moshoeshoe I.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Moshoeshoe I atop [[Thaba Bosiu]].]]\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\nAlthough he had ceded much territory, Moshoeshoe never suffered a major military defeat and retained most of his kingdom and all of his culture. His death in 1870 marked the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the modern colonial period.  Moshoeshoe Day is a national holiday in Lesotho celebrated every year on 11 March to commemorate the day of Moshoeshoe's death.{{cn| date = October 2017}}\n\n[[Moshoeshoe I International Airport]] is named in his honour.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\nSouth African-made [[Shweshwe|shweshwe fabric]] is named for King Moshoeshoe I who once received a gift of it and then popularized it throughout his realm.<ref name=Kuper>{{cite news|last=Kuper|first=Jeremy|title=London shows material interest in Africa\u2019s old clothes|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-04-19-london-shows-material-interest-in-africas-old-clothes|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=19 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525031602/http://mg.co.za/article/2013-04-19-london-shows-material-interest-in-africas-old-clothes|archivedate=25 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Holmes>{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=Thalia|title=The fabric of society needs underpinning|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-11-22-00-the-fabric-of-society-needs-underpinning|accessdate=20 January 2014|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=22 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120141942/http://mg.co.za/article/2013-11-22-00-the-fabric-of-society-needs-underpinning|archivedate=20 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn episode two of the American animated series ''[[Animaniacs]]'', the debuting [[Pinky and the Brain]] segment \"Win Big\" referenced Moshoeshoe I briefly when the Brain attempted to win $99,000 on a [[game show|quiz show]] entitled \"Gyp-parody\" so that he might construct a machine that would magnetically hold to the earth any one with loose change in his pockets.

The former Archaeology and Classics building was demolished from the site; leaving the New Theatre as a freestanding building.

The summer of 2015 saw the launch of the Student Fringe Festival, or StuFF. This festival aims to bring together both experimental and classical theatre in a two day festival held in June each year.\n\n== Organisation and structure ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\nAll aspects of the theatre are run by the 17 members of the New Theatre committee, although the producer and director of individual shows are given a large degree of autonomy with regards to their productions.\n\nThe theatre's productions are open to the public and any student at the University of Nottingham can become a member. Members receive discounts on theatre tickets and can get involved in running the theatre. Each semester a 'proposals meeting' is held by the committee at which members can suggest a play that they wish to direct. Once the upcoming season's plays are chosen by the committee, auditions are held by the production team of each play. As soon as the plays have been cast at the 'casting meeting', production teams are given a budget by the theatre treasurer and allowed a certain amount of autonomy, with the support of the relevant season's Co-ordinator on hand if they need it.\n\nEach play is expected to break even but many make a profit that is then channelled back into improving the theatre's facilities and offering more varied experiences for its members.\n\nThe President of the Nottingham New Theatre is mandated to report to and answer questions from [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|the Students' Union Council]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== New Theatre at the Fringe ==\nEach year, the New Theatre takes one or more 'official' shows to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and supports any number of shows being performed and produced at the fringe by its members.

The former Archaeology and Classics building was demolished from the site; leaving the New Theatre as a freestanding building. Parts of the old building were retained and repurposed as new rehearsal rooms, and a studio space; as well as a significant remodeling of the dressing room, and extending the foyer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn April 2015, the Nottingham New Theatre [https://history.newtheatre.org.uk History Project] was launched. This is the theatre's new archival website, holding information from shows dating back to the 1950s including posters, cast and crew lists and production shots. The summer of 2015 saw the launch of the Student Fringe Festival, or StuFF. This festival aims to bring together both experimental and classical theatre in a two day festival held in June each year.\n\n== Organisation and structure ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\nAll aspects of the theatre are run by the 17 members of the New Theatre committee, although the producer and director of individual shows are given a large degree of autonomy with regards to their productions.\n\nThe theatre's productions are open to the public and any student at the University of Nottingham can become a member. Members receive discounts on theatre tickets and can get involved in running the theatre. Each semester a 'proposals meeting' is held by the committee at which members can suggest a play that they wish to direct. Once the upcoming season's plays are chosen by the committee, auditions are held by the production team of each play. As soon as the plays have been cast at the 'casting meeting', production teams are given a budget by the theatre treasurer and allowed a certain amount of autonomy, with the support of the relevant season's Co-ordinator on hand if they need it.\n\nEach play is expected to break even but many make a profit that is then channelled back into improving the theatre's facilities and offering more varied experiences for its members.\n\nThe President of the Nottingham New Theatre is mandated to report to and answer questions from [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|the Students' Union Council]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== New Theatre at the Fringe ==\nEach year, the New Theatre takes one or more 'official' shows to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and supports any number of shows being performed and produced at the fringe by its members.

Scott Fitzgerald]] and ''Tyrannosaurus Sketch'' receiving 4-star reviews and enjoying sell out runs. An independent production also came to Edinburgh in association with the New Theatre: ''The Toyland Murders'' by the Kite Tail Theatre Company. It enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nIn 2017, the New Theatre took two devised pieces, ''Escape for Dummies'' and ''Wrecked''. Both enjoyed critical and commercial success, with ''Escape for Dummies'' gaining 5 star reviews.\n\nIn 2018, the New Theatre again took two productions, 'Working Class Hero' written by Ben Standish and directed by Felicity Chilver, and 'The Devil You Know' written and directed by Emma Summerton. These productions took place at Greenside @ Infirmary Street.\n\nIn 2019, two more productions were taken to the Fringe, 'Order from Chaos' written and directed by Jonny Khan, and 'Franz and Marie: Woyzeck Retold' written and directed by Daniel Mcvey. These productions also took place at Greenside @ Infirmary Street. Both shows were met with critical success with 'Order From Chaos' receiving 5-star reviews.\n\n== New Theatre at NSDF ==\nIn 2007 and 2008, New Theatre entered a number of shows into the [[National Student Drama Festival]] competition. In both years two productions were selected by the NSDF judges as finalists and were performed at the Festival in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. In 2008 the theatre's shows '[[Disco Pigs]]' and '[[Proof (play)|Proof]]' won 6 awards between them, with the theatre also receiving the 'Judges\u2019 Award for Promoting Student Theatre'.<ref name=\"entertainment.timesonline\">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article3628384.ece |title=Nottingham New Theatre |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.ukAaccessdate=2015-10-09}} {{subscription required|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The NSDF, however, is about drama, not drama students, and a university with no theatre studies at all had two shows in performance.

Starring [[Brian O'Halloran]] and [[Jeff Anderson]], it presents a day in the lives of titular store clerks [[Dante Hicks]] (O'Halloran) and [[Randal Graves]] (Anderson), along with their acquaintances. ''Clerks'' is the first of Smith's [[View Askewniverse]] films, and introduces several recurring characters, notably [[Jay and Silent Bob]] ([[Jason Mewes]] and Smith).\n\n''Clerks'' was shot for $27,575 in the convenience and video stores where director Smith worked in real life. Upon its theatrical release, the film received generally positive reviews and grossed over $3 million in theaters, launching Smith's career. The film is considered a landmark in independent filmmaking and, in 2019, was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], who deemed it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purple-rain-amadeus-boys-dont-cry-clerks-enter-national-film-registry-1261469|title='Purple Rain,' 'Amadeus,' 'Boys Don't Cry,' 'Clerks' Enter National Film Registry|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nDante Hicks, a young man who works as a retail clerk at Quick Stop Groceries in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], is called into work on his day off to cover another employee's morning shift. Arriving at the store, he finds that the locks to the security shutters are jammed closed with [[chewing gum]], so he hangs a sheet over them with a message written in shoe polish: \"I ASSURE YOU; WE'RE OPEN!\". Soon after opening, Dante's best friend, wisecracking [[slacker]] Randal Graves, arrives for his own workday at the video rental store next door.\n\nThe two prepare for [[Slice of life|another ordinary day]] immersed in their tedious [[customer service]] jobs. Dante repeatedly laments that he is \"not even supposed to be here today,\" while Randal neglects his job at the video store to keep Dante company at the Quick Stop. They pass the time engaging in philosophical discussions on a wide variety of topics, including movies, sex, relationships, and difficult customers. Some of the customers they encounter during the day are angry and demanding; others, clueless and impolite; still others prove unexpectedly wise. After several hours, Dante discovers that his boss has left on a trip to [[Vermont]], leaving him to run the store alone for the rest of the day. Dante and Randal find a number of reasons to leave the store and slack off, from a rooftop hockey game with Dante's friends to an ill-fated [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for one of Dante's ex-lovers.\n\nDante is [[Love triangle|torn between two women]]: his current girlfriend Veronica Loughran and his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree, with whom he still secretly communicates. Dante is distressed when he learns Veronica has given [[oral sex]] to 36 other men before him, and engaged in [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]] with at least one. Despite Veronica's doting on him, Dante chooses to rekindle his relationship with Caitlin. However, Caitlin is traumatized by an incident in the Quick Stop bathroom; in the dark, she has sex with a person she thought was Dante, but who was actually a customer who had died of a [[heart attack]] while [[masturbating]] to a [[pornography|pornographic magazine]] Dante provided him. Caitlin leaves catatonic in an ambulance.\n\n[[Jay and Silent Bob]], a pair of drug dealers who have spent the day [[loitering]] outside the store, invite Dante to party with them after hours, but Dante declines, considering the various seedy characters the two have been attracting all day. Aware of Dante's problems, Silent Bob tersely convinces him that he really loves Veronica, but Randal has already confessed the previous events to her, prompting Veronica to dramatically dump Dante. Dante fights with Randal, trashing the Quick Stop.\n\nDante and Randal have a crucial moment of clarity after their fight. Randal hears Dante repeat his refrain that he's \"not even supposed to be here today\" and points out that Dante could have left at any time and prevented the day's events; furthermore, he says they are not as \"advanced\" as they think they are, or else they would not be stuck in such lowly jobs.\n\nAfter the two make amends, Dante plans to visit Caitlin in the hospital and try to reconcile with Veronica. Randal leaves, but not before tossing Dante's shoe-polish sign in his face and declaring, \"You're closed!\"<ref>Kevin Smith. ''Clerks and Chasing Amy : Two Screenplays''.

This would have serious financial implications for the film, as very few cinemas in the United States screen NC-17 films. Miramax hired civil liberties lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] to appeal the decision and the MPAA relented and re-rated the film with the more commercially viable \"R\" rating, without alteration.<ref name=vainfo />\n\nThe film was shot in [[black-and-white]] and roughly edited due to a [[Low-budget film|very modest budget]] of $27,575. To acquire the funds for the film, Kevin Smith sold a large portion of his extensive comic book collection in 1993, maxed out eight to 10 credit cards with $2,000 limits, dipped into a portion of funds set aside for his college education, and spent insurance money awarded for a car Jason Mewes and he lost in a flood.<ref name=vainfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/clerks/info.html|title=Clerks: Movie Info|website=Viewaskew.com|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The film was shot in 21 straight days (with two \"[[pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]]\" days).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/the-ultimate-clerks-quiz |title=The Ultimate Clerks Quiz |date= |website=[[ShortList]] Magazine |publisher=ShortList Media |accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> Smith based the character of Dante  Hicks on himself, and Randal Graves on his friend [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]]<ref name=CBM2.4>{{cite episode|series=[[Comic Book Men]]|title=Ming in Charge|number=4|season=2|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|airdate=November 4, 2012}}</ref> who appeared in Smith's subsequent films.\n\nThe Quick Stop convenience store (located at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Quick+Stop/@40.415197,-74.0582097,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c23736ed9e9bb1:0x7c288c835eb66dd4!8m2!3d40.415197!4d-74.0571154 58 Leonard Avenue] in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]]), where Smith worked, was the primary setting for the film. He was only allowed to film in the store at night while it was closed (from 10:30&nbsp;pm to 5:30&nbsp;am), hence the plot point of the [[window shutter|shutters]] being closed due to a vandal having jammed gum in the padlocks. Because Smith was working at Quick Stop during the day and shooting the film at night, he frequently slept no more than an hour a day. By the end of the 21-day shoot, Smith was unable to stay awake while some of the most climactic scenes of the film were shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peterbroderick.com/writing/writing/learningfromlowbudgets.html|title=Learning From Low-Budgets|author=Peter Broderick|website=PeterBroderick.com|publisher=Filmmaker Magazine|date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== The lost scene ===\nThe events of Julie Dwyer's wake were scripted by Smith, but were not filmed due to the prohibitive cost of producing the scene.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4h-UbzIGK0</ref> For the tenth anniversary ''Clerks X'' DVD release, the scene was produced in color using an animation style similar to that of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''.

After Randal leaves, Dante proceeds to count out the register and does not notice another person entering the store. Upon Dante's informing the latecomer that the store is no longer open, the customer shoots Dante, killing him. Afterward, the killer makes off with all the money from the cash register. The sequence ends with Dante's dead face looking off past the camera; after the credits roll - the soundtrack over it being a cash register making noises - a customer (played by Smith with his beard shaved off) wearing glasses and in a ponytail and a baseball jersey comes into the store, sees no one around (as Dante is lying dead behind the counter) and steals some cigarettes.<ref name=snowballdoc>{{cite AV media |people=Phil Benson (director), Kevin Smith |date=7 September 2004 |title=Snowball Effect: The Story of 'Clerks' |trans-title= |medium=motion picture |language=English |url= |access-date= |location= |publisher=View Askew Productions |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe depressing ending was criticized by Bob Hawk and [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]] after its first screening at the Independent Feature Film Market, and under Pierson's advice, Smith cut the ending short, ending with Randal's departure and deleting Dante's death. Fans have since analyzed the death of Dante as an homage to the ending of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', which is discussed earlier in the film as Dante's favorite ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie because \"it ended on such a down note\". Deleted scenes from the film's extended cut also implied that the killer would never be caught, as Randal disconnected the security cameras earlier in the day.\n\nKevin Smith has since claimed  he concluded ''Clerks'' this way for three reasons. The primary reason was irony, the ending would be the payoff for Dante's repeated claims of \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\" Smith also stated that the ending was an homage to [[Spike Lee]]'s ending to ''[[Do The Right Thing]]'', a comedic film with a dark ending. Lee's name can even be seen in the \"special thanks\" portion of the credits. Smith also stated that he ended ''Clerks'' with Dante's death because he \"didn't know how to end a film\".<ref name=snowballdoc /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70020/18-black-and-white-facts-about-clerks|title=18 Black-and-White Facts About \u2018Clerks\u2019|author=Nick Keppler|website=[[Mental Floss]]|date=17 October 2015|access-date=21 January 2017}}</ref> Both versions are available in ''Clerks X'', the 10th-anniversary special edition; the lost ending itself was among the extras on the 1995 LaserDisc and the 1999 DVD release; Smith states in his commentary on the 1999 DVD that had he kept the original ending, likely no further View Askewniverse films would have been made.

It was then released as a three-disc, 10th-anniversary edition set in 2004.\n\nThe film was released on UMD (playable on [[PlayStation Portable]]) on November 15, 2005. Special features include \"Clerks: The Lost Scene\", \"The Flying Car\", and original cast auditions. In the fall of 2006, a new edition of the ''Clerks'' DVD appeared in Canada, dubbed the ''Clerks: Snowball Edition''.

The features for this version of the DVD include:\n* A 24-page color booklet featuring thoughts on the film from Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier ten years after making it. The booklet also features various reprints of reviews and images of posters and memorabilia from the film's release. Smith states in the booklet that ''Clerks II'' would be filmed in 2005.\n\n'''Disc 1 \u2013 Theatrical Feature'''\n* The original theatrical cut of the film in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.\n** The original 1995 laser disc commentary track.\n** An \"enhanced playback track\" featuring trivia subtitles and title card descriptions.\n* \"[[Clerks: The Lost Scene]]\" animated short. This scene was originally written in the screenplay for the film but was never shot. For the DVD, the scene was animated in the same style as ''Clerks: The Animated Series''. The scene can be presented in two different ways.\n** The scene can be viewed separately from the film with an introduction by Smith and Mosier.\n** The DVD also presents the owner with the ability to play the theatrical cut of the film with the animated scene as if it were part of the feature.\n* ''[[The Flying Car]]'', a [[short film]] featuring Dante and Randal. The short was shot in 2001 for ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and features the two main characters from ''Clerks'' stuck in traffic having a somewhat similar conversation as the one in ''Clerks'' where the two are driving to a funeral and discussing sexual curiosity. On the DVD, the short is presented in its original cut with an introduction from Smith.\n* A series of short television ads that [[MTV]] commissioned from Kevin Smith featuring Jay and Silent Bob. Eight of them appear on the DVD, two of which have edited soundtracks (MTV also aired a special that Smith hosted but it could not be secured for the DVD for clearance reasons). The spots are introduced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier.\n* An original [[film trailer]] for the film edited by Matthew Cohen with a brief introduction from Kevin Smith.\n* The original [[music video]] for \"Can't Even Tell\" performed by [[Soul Asylum]] directed by Kevin Smith. The music video is introduced by Smith and Scott Mosier.\n* Three short featurettes about the restoration process used to recreate the feature film for the ''Clerks X'' DVD. In the first featurette, Scott Mosier describes the sound restoration process. In the second, David Klein explains the visual restoration process. The third featurette is hosted by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier as a general introduction to the restored version of the film.\n* Original auditions for the film featuring Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, and Ernest O'Donnell. The auditions are introduced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier.\n* DVD-ROM features.\n\n'''Disc 2 \u2013 Clerks: The First Cut'''\n* The very first cut of the film before it was edited for theaters. It features additional scenes and the original ending intact, less sound production, and the original soundtrack which featured music by [[Love Among Freaks]] exclusively. This version replicates what Smith showed to film critics and journalists before taking the film to Sundance and selling it to Miramax. It was taken from a Super-VHS tape and unlike the theatrical release underwent no apparent restoration. It is included in the 10th anniversary set in lieu of the collection of deleted scenes that had appeared in the previous DVD issue.\n** [[Audio commentary|Audio]] and video commentary for the first cut of the film. The commentary was recorded in 2004 with Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson and Jason Mewes.\n\n'''Disc 3 \u2013 Bonus Features'''\n* \"Snowball Effect\", a 90-minute retrospective documentary for ''Clerks'' that focuses on Smith's early inception of the film, the process of making and distributing and finally, the reaction and response to the film from critics and fans.\n* ''Mae Day: The Crumbling of a Documentary'', a short student film that Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier made during their time at film school. It comes with an introduction by Smith and Mosier.\n* 10th Anniversary Q&A session with Kevin Smith, David Klein, Scott Mosier, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran.\n* 13 [[deleted scene]]s and [[outtake]]s from ''Snowball Effect''\n* A still photo gallery of over 50 photographs and production images from ''Clerks'' as well as early photos of crew and cast members.\n* Two collections of journal entries written by Smith. The first entries were written before finishing ''Clerks'' and the second were written while Smith took the film to Sundance Film Festival.\n* Eight articles and reviews about the film.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Main|Clerks (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack was released on October 11, 1994. It was composed of various new and previously released songs by [[alternative rock]], [[grunge]] and [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Bad Religion]], [[Love Among Freaks]], [[Alice in Chains]], and [[Soul Asylum]]. The soundtrack also featured various sound clips from the film. It has been noted that ''Clerks'' is one of the very few films in which the cost of obtaining the rights to the music used was a great portion of the production costs for the entire film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/clerks-budget/|title=POTD: Kevin Smith Shows Original Clerks Budget Proposal|date=2016-01-01|website=/Film|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Soul Asylum song \"Can't Even Tell\", which was played over the film's end credits and featured on the soundtrack, peaked at number 16 on the [[Alternative Songs|Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in 1994. The music video for the song was directed by Smith and was filmed in the same locations as the film.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2009/09/cinema-sounds-clerks-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|title=Cinema Sounds: Clerks|date=2 September 2009|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The video featured Smith, Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprising their roles from ''Clerks''.\n\nAnother song which appeared on the soundtrack was \"[[Got Me Wrong]]\" by Alice in Chains, which had previously been released on the band's extended play ''[[Sap (album)|Sap]]'' (1992). The song was issued as a single in late 1994, due to renewed radio interest from the song's appearance in ''Clerks''. The song peaked at #7 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and #22 on the [[Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]] in early 1995.\n\n==Sequels==\nAlthough not direct sequels in terms of addressing the original film's storyline, characters from the original ''Clerks'' - primarily Jay and Silent Bob - appeared in the films ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999), and ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001), all of which take place in the same continuity as ''Clerks''. Dante and Randal also reprised their roles in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', which was originally promoted as the finale to the series, but an official sequel to ''Clerks'' was announced a few years later.\n\n=== ''Clerks II'' ===\n{{Main|Clerks II}}\nThe live-action, feature film [[sequel]] to ''Clerks'' was released on July 21, 2006. The working title was ''The Passion of the Clerks'', though the film was released under the title ''Clerks II''. The credits for ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' stated \"Jay and Silent Bob will return in ''Clerks 2: Hardly Clerkin{{'}} ''\"; however, that project \"evolved\" into ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. The sequel features Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprising their roles as Dante Hicks and Randal Graves. The two now work at a [[Mooby]]'s restaurant after Graves' incompetence resulted in the destruction of the Quick Stop and RST Video.\n\n=== ''Clerks III'' ===\nDuring press for ''Clerks II'', Smith briefly discussed the possibility of a ''Clerks III''. Stating that \"if there's ever gonna be a ''Clerks III'', it would be somewhere down the road in my 40s or 50s, when it might be interesting to check back in on Dante and Randal. But I don't know about Jay and Bob so much, 'cause at 45, leaning on a wall in front of a convenience store might be a little sad.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20233192-5006023,00.html | work=Herald Sun | first=Neala | last=Johnson | title=Silent Bob speaks | date=August 24, 2006}}</ref> Smith repeated this sentiment on one of the audio commentary tracks on the ''Clerks II'' DVD, to which [[Jeff Anderson]] jokingly replied, \"Oh, don't get me started\", referring to Anderson's well known doubts about making ''Clerks II'' when first approached by Smith.\n\nOn March 29, 2012, Smith expressed his interest in producing ''Clerks III'' as a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play after seeing the [[Theresa Rebeck]] comedy ''[[Seminar (play)|Seminar]]'' starring [[Alan Rickman]], with whom Smith had previously worked on ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/160948/kevin-smith-eyes-bringing-clerks-to-broadway/|title=Kevin Smith Eyes Bringing Clerks to Broadway|website=Broadway.com|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 2012, Smith released a special [[Hollywood Babble-On]] episode, ''Hollywood Babble-On #000: GIANT SIZED ANNUAL # 1: CLERKS III, AUDIENCE 0'', in which he revealed greater details on his plans for ''Clerks III''. Smith stated that an ongoing audit over residuals from ''Clerks II'' with [[The Weinstein Company]] was causing a delay in several key ''Clerks III'' cast and crew members, including Anderson and [[Scott Mosier]], from coming on board until the audit was resolved. Smith also revealed that he would like to [[crowdsource]] ''Clerks III'', either through [[Kickstarter]] or [[Indiegogo]], with contributors receiving anything from DVDs, posters, and even roles as extras in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/giant-sized-annual-1-clerks-iii-audience-0/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213002934/http://smodcast.com/episodes/giant-sized-annual-1-clerks-iii-audience-0/ |archivedate=2012-12-13 }}</ref> On June 5, 2013, he changed his mind on crowdsourcing, stating \"I've got access to money.

Smith continued: \"A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get ''Clerks III'' made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was ''Tusk'', it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?'

The pilot only referenced the character names and starred none of the cast from the original film, contained no foul language (except words suitable enough for a [[TV-PG]] rating), and did not feature Silent Bob. The character of Jay was featured, prompting Smith to point out that he owned the character rights to both Jay and Silent Bob (for the purposes of featuring them in separate films). The producers' solution was to change the character's name to Ray. Kevin Smith was unaware of the production of the series until casting was underway. Smith had been in production with ''[[Mallrats]]'' at the time and attempted to become involved in the series but became disheartened quickly as an episode he had written for the series was shot down to be used as a potential B-plot.

Starring [[Brian O'Halloran]] and [[Jeff Anderson]], it presents a day in the lives of titular store clerks [[Dante Hicks]] (O'Halloran) and [[Randal Graves]] (Anderson), along with their acquaintances. ''Clerks'' is the first of Smith's [[View Askewniverse]] films, and introduces several recurring characters, notably [[Jay and Silent Bob]] ([[Jason Mewes]] and Smith).\n\n''Clerks'' was shot for $27,575 in the convenience and video stores where director Smith worked in real life. Upon its theatrical release, the film received generally positive reviews and grossed over $3 million in theaters, launching Smith's career. The film is considered a landmark in independent filmmaking and, in 2019, was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], who deemed it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purple-rain-amadeus-boys-dont-cry-clerks-enter-national-film-registry-1261469|title='Purple Rain,' 'Amadeus,' 'Boys Don't Cry,' 'Clerks' Enter National Film Registry|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nDante Hicks, a young man who works as a retail clerk at Quick Stop Groceries in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], is called into work on his day off to cover another employee's morning shift. Arriving at the store, he finds that the locks to the security shutters are jammed closed with [[chewing gum]], so he hangs a sheet over them with a message written in shoe polish: \"I ASSURE YOU; WE'RE OPEN!\". Soon after opening, Dante's best friend, wisecracking [[slacker]] Randal Graves, arrives for his own workday at the video rental store next door.\n\nThe two prepare for [[Slice of life|another ordinary day]] immersed in their tedious [[customer service]] jobs. Dante repeatedly laments that he is \"not even supposed to be here today,\" while Randal neglects his job at the video store to keep Dante company at the Quick Stop. They pass the time engaging in philosophical discussions on a wide variety of topics, including movies, sex, relationships, and difficult customers. Some of the customers they encounter during the day are angry and demanding; others, clueless and impolite; still others prove unexpectedly wise. After several hours, Dante discovers that his boss has left on a trip to [[Vermont]], leaving him to run the store alone for the rest of the day. Dante and Randal find a number of reasons to leave the store and slack off, from a rooftop hockey game with Dante's friends to an ill-fated [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for one of Dante's ex-lovers.\n\nDante is [[Love triangle|torn between two women]]: his current girlfriend Veronica Loughran and his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree, with whom he still secretly communicates. Dante is distressed when he learns Veronica has given [[oral sex]] to 36 other men before him, and engaged in [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]] with at least one. Despite Veronica's doting on him, Dante chooses to rekindle his relationship with Caitlin. However, Caitlin is traumatized by an incident in the Quick Stop bathroom; in the dark, she has sex with a person she thought was Dante, but who was actually a customer who had died of a [[heart attack]] while [[masturbating]] to a [[pornography|pornographic magazine]] Dante provided him. Caitlin leaves catatonic in an ambulance.\n\n[[Jay and Silent Bob]], a pair of drug dealers who have spent the day [[loitering]] outside the store, invite Dante to party with them after hours, but Dante declines, considering the various seedy characters the two have been attracting all day. Aware of Dante's problems, Silent Bob tersely convinces him that he really loves Veronica, but Randal has already confessed the previous events to her, prompting Veronica to dramatically dump Dante. Dante fights with Randal, trashing the Quick Stop.\n\nDante and Randal have a crucial moment of clarity after their fight. Randal hears Dante repeat his refrain that he's \"not even supposed to be here today\" and points out that Dante could have left at any time and prevented the day's events; furthermore, he says they are not as \"advanced\" as they think they are, or else they would not be stuck in such lowly jobs.\n\nAfter the two make amends, Dante plans to visit Caitlin in the hospital and try to reconcile with Veronica. Randal leaves, but not before tossing Dante's shoe-polish sign in his face and declaring, \"You're closed!\"<ref>Kevin Smith. ''Clerks and Chasing Amy : Two Screenplays''.

This would have serious financial implications for the film, as very few cinemas in the United States screen NC-17 films. Miramax hired civil liberties lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] to appeal the decision and the MPAA relented and re-rated the film with the more commercially viable \"R\" rating, without alteration.<ref name=vainfo />\n\nThe film was shot in [[black-and-white]] and roughly edited due to a [[Low-budget film|very modest budget]] of $27,575. To acquire the funds for the film, Kevin Smith sold a large portion of his extensive comic book collection in 1993, maxed out eight to 10 credit cards with $2,000 limits, dipped into a portion of funds set aside for his college education, and spent insurance money awarded for a car Jason Mewes and he lost in a flood.<ref name=vainfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/clerks/info.html|title=Clerks: Movie Info|website=Viewaskew.com|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The film was shot in 21 straight days (with two \"[[pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]]\" days).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/the-ultimate-clerks-quiz |title=The Ultimate Clerks Quiz |date= |website=[[ShortList]] Magazine |publisher=ShortList Media |accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> Smith based the character of Dante  Hicks on himself, and Randal Graves on his friend [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]]<ref name=CBM2.4>{{cite episode|series=[[Comic Book Men]]|title=Ming in Charge|number=4|season=2|network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|airdate=November 4, 2012}}</ref> who appeared in Smith's subsequent films.\n\nThe Quick Stop convenience store (located at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Quick+Stop/@40.415197,-74.0582097,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c23736ed9e9bb1:0x7c288c835eb66dd4!8m2!3d40.415197!4d-74.0571154 58 Leonard Avenue] in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]]), where Smith worked, was the primary setting for the film. He was only allowed to film in the store at night while it was closed (from 10:30&nbsp;pm to 5:30&nbsp;am), hence the plot point of the [[window shutter|shutters]] being closed due to a vandal having jammed gum in the padlocks. Because Smith was working at Quick Stop during the day and shooting the film at night, he frequently slept no more than an hour a day. By the end of the 21-day shoot, Smith was unable to stay awake while some of the most climactic scenes of the film were shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peterbroderick.com/writing/writing/learningfromlowbudgets.html|title=Learning From Low-Budgets|author=Peter Broderick|website=PeterBroderick.com|publisher=Filmmaker Magazine|date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== The lost scene ===\nThe events of Julie Dwyer's wake were scripted by Smith, but were not filmed due to the prohibitive cost of producing the scene.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4h-UbzIGK0</ref> For the tenth anniversary ''Clerks X'' DVD release, the scene was produced in color using an animation style similar to that of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''.

After Randal leaves, Dante proceeds to count out the register and does not notice another person entering the store. Upon Dante's informing the latecomer that the store is no longer open, the customer shoots Dante, killing him. Afterward, the killer makes off with all the money from the cash register. The sequence ends with Dante's dead face looking off past the camera; after the credits roll - the soundtrack over it being a cash register making noises - a customer (played by Smith with his beard shaved off) wearing glasses and in a ponytail and a baseball jersey comes into the store, sees no one around (as Dante is lying dead behind the counter) and steals some cigarettes.<ref name=snowballdoc>{{cite AV media |people=Phil Benson (director), Kevin Smith |date=7 September 2004 |title=Snowball Effect: The Story of 'Clerks' |trans-title= |medium=motion picture |language=English |url= |access-date= |location= |publisher=View Askew Productions |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe depressing ending was criticized by Bob Hawk and [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]] after its first screening at the Independent Feature Film Market, and under Pierson's advice, Smith cut the ending short, ending with Randal's departure and deleting Dante's death. Fans have since analyzed the death of Dante as an homage to the ending of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', which is discussed earlier in the film as Dante's favorite ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie because \"it ended on such a down note\". Deleted scenes from the film's extended cut also implied that the killer would never be caught, as Randal disconnected the security cameras earlier in the day.\n\nKevin Smith has since claimed  he concluded ''Clerks'' this way for three reasons. The primary reason was irony, the ending would be the payoff for Dante's repeated claims of \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\" Smith also stated that the ending was an homage to [[Spike Lee]]'s ending to ''[[Do The Right Thing]]'', a comedic film with a dark ending. Lee's name can even be seen in the \"special thanks\" portion of the credits. Smith also stated that he ended ''Clerks'' with Dante's death because he \"didn't know how to end a film\".<ref name=snowballdoc /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70020/18-black-and-white-facts-about-clerks|title=18 Black-and-White Facts About \u2018Clerks\u2019|author=Nick Keppler|website=[[Mental Floss]]|date=17 October 2015|access-date=21 January 2017}}</ref> Both versions are available in ''Clerks X'', the 10th-anniversary special edition; the lost ending itself was among the extras on the 1995 LaserDisc and the 1999 DVD release; Smith states in his commentary on the 1999 DVD that had he kept the original ending, likely no further View Askewniverse films would have been made.

The special features for the DVD do not vary from the LaserDisc features. It was then released as a three-disc, 10th-anniversary edition set in 2004.\n\nThe film was released on UMD (playable on [[PlayStation Portable]]) on November 15, 2005. Special features include \"Clerks: The Lost Scene\", \"The Flying Car\", and original cast auditions. In the fall of 2006, a new edition of the ''Clerks'' DVD appeared in Canada, dubbed the ''Clerks: Snowball Edition''. The new release included a photo of a bikini-clad model on the cover and some of the extra features from the 1999 edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0665000FSM2125298&catid=14711|title=Computers, TVs, Video Games & Appliances - Best Buy Canada|website=Futureshop.ca|accessdate=2 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It appears Smith was not involved in this release, as he indicated on his official message forum in August 2006 that he was not aware of its release.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061018005056/http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=49555]</ref>\n\n''Clerks'' was released on [[Blu-ray]] on November 17, 2009, as a \"15th Anniversary Edition\". It has the same special features as ''Clerks X'', below, along with a new documentary, ''[[Oh, What a Lovely Tea Party]]'', as well as an introduction to the documentary by Kevin Smith.\n\n=== ''Clerks X'' ===\nOn September 7, 2004, a tenth anniversary edition of ''Clerks'' was released. The 3-disc set is commonly known as ''Clerks X'' as part of the [[Miramax Films]] Collector's Series. The features for this version of the DVD include:\n* A 24-page color booklet featuring thoughts on the film from Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier ten years after making it. The booklet also features various reprints of reviews and images of posters and memorabilia from the film's release. Smith states in the booklet that ''Clerks II'' would be filmed in 2005.\n\n'''Disc 1 \u2013 Theatrical Feature'''\n* The original theatrical cut of the film in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.\n** The original 1995 laser disc commentary track.\n** An \"enhanced playback track\" featuring trivia subtitles and title card descriptions.\n* \"[[Clerks: The Lost Scene]]\" animated short. This scene was originally written in the screenplay for the film but was never shot. For the DVD, the scene was animated in the same style as ''Clerks: The Animated Series''. The scene can be presented in two different ways.\n** The scene can be viewed separately from the film with an introduction by Smith and Mosier.\n** The DVD also presents the owner with the ability to play the theatrical cut of the film with the animated scene as if it were part of the feature.\n* ''[[The Flying Car]]'', a [[short film]] featuring Dante and Randal. The short was shot in 2001 for ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and features the two main characters from ''Clerks'' stuck in traffic having a somewhat similar conversation as the one in ''Clerks'' where the two are driving to a funeral and discussing sexual curiosity. On the DVD, the short is presented in its original cut with an introduction from Smith.\n* A series of short television ads that [[MTV]] commissioned from Kevin Smith featuring Jay and Silent Bob. Eight of them appear on the DVD, two of which have edited soundtracks (MTV also aired a special that Smith hosted but it could not be secured for the DVD for clearance reasons). The spots are introduced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier.\n* An original [[film trailer]] for the film edited by Matthew Cohen with a brief introduction from Kevin Smith.\n* The original [[music video]] for \"Can't Even Tell\" performed by [[Soul Asylum]] directed by Kevin Smith. The music video is introduced by Smith and Scott Mosier.\n* Three short featurettes about the restoration process used to recreate the feature film for the ''Clerks X'' DVD. In the first featurette, Scott Mosier describes the sound restoration process. In the second, David Klein explains the visual restoration process. The third featurette is hosted by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier as a general introduction to the restored version of the film.\n* Original auditions for the film featuring Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, and Ernest O'Donnell. The auditions are introduced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier.\n* DVD-ROM features.\n\n'''Disc 2 \u2013 Clerks: The First Cut'''\n* The very first cut of the film before it was edited for theaters. It features additional scenes and the original ending intact, less sound production, and the original soundtrack which featured music by [[Love Among Freaks]] exclusively. This version replicates what Smith showed to film critics and journalists before taking the film to Sundance and selling it to Miramax. It was taken from a Super-VHS tape and unlike the theatrical release underwent no apparent restoration. It is included in the 10th anniversary set in lieu of the collection of deleted scenes that had appeared in the previous DVD issue.\n** [[Audio commentary|Audio]] and video commentary for the first cut of the film. The commentary was recorded in 2004 with Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson and Jason Mewes.\n\n'''Disc 3 \u2013 Bonus Features'''\n* \"Snowball Effect\", a 90-minute retrospective documentary for ''Clerks'' that focuses on Smith's early inception of the film, the process of making and distributing and finally, the reaction and response to the film from critics and fans.\n* ''Mae Day: The Crumbling of a Documentary'', a short student film that Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier made during their time at film school. It comes with an introduction by Smith and Mosier.\n* 10th Anniversary Q&A session with Kevin Smith, David Klein, Scott Mosier, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran.\n* 13 [[deleted scene]]s and [[outtake]]s from ''Snowball Effect''\n* A still photo gallery of over 50 photographs and production images from ''Clerks'' as well as early photos of crew and cast members.\n* Two collections of journal entries written by Smith. The first entries were written before finishing ''Clerks'' and the second were written while Smith took the film to Sundance Film Festival.\n* Eight articles and reviews about the film.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Main|Clerks (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack was released on October 11, 1994. It was composed of various new and previously released songs by [[alternative rock]], [[grunge]] and [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Bad Religion]], [[Love Among Freaks]], [[Alice in Chains]], and [[Soul Asylum]]. The soundtrack also featured various sound clips from the film. It has been noted that ''Clerks'' is one of the very few films in which the cost of obtaining the rights to the music used was a great portion of the production costs for the entire film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/clerks-budget/|title=POTD: Kevin Smith Shows Original Clerks Budget Proposal|date=2016-01-01|website=/Film|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Soul Asylum song \"Can't Even Tell\", which was played over the film's end credits and featured on the soundtrack, peaked at number 16 on the [[Alternative Songs|Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in 1994.

The song was issued as a single in late 1994, due to renewed radio interest from the song's appearance in ''Clerks''. The song peaked at #7 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and #22 on the [[Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]] in early 1995.\n\n==Sequels==\nAlthough not direct sequels in terms of addressing the original film's storyline, characters from the original ''Clerks'' - primarily Jay and Silent Bob - appeared in the films ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999), and ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001), all of which take place in the same continuity as ''Clerks''. Dante and Randal also reprised their roles in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', which was originally promoted as the finale to the series, but an official sequel to ''Clerks'' was announced a few years later.\n\n=== ''Clerks II'' ===\n{{Main|Clerks II}}\nThe live-action, feature film [[sequel]] to ''Clerks'' was released on July 21, 2006. The working title was ''The Passion of the Clerks'', though the film was released under the title ''Clerks II''. The credits for ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' stated \"Jay and Silent Bob will return in ''Clerks 2: Hardly Clerkin{{'}} ''\"; however, that project \"evolved\" into ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. The sequel features Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprising their roles as Dante Hicks and Randal Graves. The two now work at a [[Mooby]]'s restaurant after Graves' incompetence resulted in the destruction of the Quick Stop and RST Video.\n\n=== ''Clerks III'' ===\nDuring press for ''Clerks II'', Smith briefly discussed the possibility of a ''Clerks III''. Stating that \"if there's ever gonna be a ''Clerks III'', it would be somewhere down the road in my 40s or 50s, when it might be interesting to check back in on Dante and Randal.

Smith stated that an ongoing audit over residuals from ''Clerks II'' with [[The Weinstein Company]] was causing a delay in several key ''Clerks III'' cast and crew members, including Anderson and [[Scott Mosier]], from coming on board until the audit was resolved.

And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was ''Tusk'', it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?'

The pilot only referenced the character names and starred none of the cast from the original film, contained no foul language (except words suitable enough for a [[TV-PG]] rating), and did not feature Silent Bob. The character of Jay was featured, prompting Smith to point out that he owned the character rights to both Jay and Silent Bob (for the purposes of featuring them in separate films). The producers' solution was to change the character's name to Ray. Kevin Smith was unaware of the production of the series until casting was underway. Smith had been in production with ''[[Mallrats]]'' at the time and attempted to become involved in the series but became disheartened quickly as an episode he had written for the series was shot down to be used as a potential B-plot.

Union Berlin manager [[Uwe Neuhaus]] subsequently labelled Quiring a \"great Unioner\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Unions Quiring schimpft \u00fcber \"Wessis\"|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/nach-der-niederlage-gegen-hertha-unions-quiring-schimpft-ueber-wessis/7091714.html|newspaper=Der Tagesspiegel|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=18 December 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, Union Berlin gained promotion to the [[Bundesliga]] for the first time in their history.

Liga]], gaining promotion to the [[2. Bundesliga]]. On 8 July 2009, Union and Hertha played in a friendly at the Stadion An der Alten F\u00f6rsterei to celebrate the re-opening of the stadium following a season-long renovation period that saw 2,000 volunteers contribute to the building of the stadium.

Bundesliga. On 17 September 2010, Union Berlin played Hertha BSC in the first ever competitive meeting between the pair. The tie at the Stadion An der Alten F\u00f6rsterei finished 1\u20131 in front of 18,432 spectators. The return game at the Olympiastadion, played in front of 74,244, finished 2\u20131 in favour of Union Berlin, with Union Berlin cult hero [[Torsten Mattuschka]] scoring the winning free-kick in the 71st minute.<ref name = \"BF\"/> By the third competitive meeting between the two, signs that the derby was beginning to turn exclusively into a rivalry more than a friendship were beginning to show. After Hertha BSC's 2\u20131 win at the Stadion An der Alten F\u00f6rsterei, Union Berlin goalscorer [[Christopher Quiring]] labelled Hertha's fans [[Wessi]]s, a semi-derogatory term for West Germans, telling [[Sport1 (Germany)|Sport1]] \"They cheer in our stadium. That makes me puke! You have to digest that first. I don't give a shit about my goal. When the Wessis cheer in our stadium, I get sick\". Union Berlin manager [[Uwe Neuhaus]] subsequently labelled Quiring a \"great Unioner\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Unions Quiring schimpft \u00fcber \"Wessis\"|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/nach-der-niederlage-gegen-hertha-unions-quiring-schimpft-ueber-wessis/7091714.html|newspaper=Der Tagesspiegel|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=18 December 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, Union Berlin gained promotion to the [[Bundesliga]] for the first time in their history. Ahead of the first top flight Berlin derby in over 40 years, Hertha BSC expressed a desire to play the game on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 2019.
