The film was marketed with the tagline \"Don't let the title fool you\", a reference to a scene in which Randy comments on Angel's name, to which Angel replies, \"Don't let the name fool you.\"\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] said of the film that it \"somehow does succeed in treating the awesome and scary subject of sexual initiation with some of the dignity it deserves.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800325/REVIEWS/3250301/1023 Little Darlings] By Roger Ebert, rogerebert.com, March 25, 1980</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of teenage girls from [[Atlanta]] go to summer camp, and, unbeknownst to the adults, two of them make a bet as to which one will lose her virginity first, with all the girls in camp betting money on the contest. The girls involved in the contest are opposites and rivals: cynical, suspicious and streetwise poor girl Angel Bright (played by Kristy McNichol) and naive, prissy and romantic rich girl Ferris Whitney (played by Tatum O\u2019Neal). The rest of the girls divide into two \"teams\", each rooting for and egging on either Ferris or Angel.  The two girls then choose  guys they want to lose their virginity with. Angel targets Randy, a boy from the camp across the lake, and Ferris attempts to seduce Gary Callahan, the (much older) camp counselor.\n\nThe girls also engage in typical teenage camp behavior, like food fights and singing around a campfire.\n\nBoth girls discover that sex is not what they thought it would be.\n\nFerris thinks of love as romance and wine and flowers.  She imagines herself swept off her feet by Gary.  When she lies about \"making love\" with him, the biological aspect manifests itself in Gary getting in trouble for having sex with a fifteen-year-old. She discovers that physical sex can have ugly consequences.  Her attitude is now more grounded in reality; she has become more like street-wise Angel.\n\nMeanwhile, street-wise Angel approaches the same issue from the other side and learns the opposite lesson. She views winning the contest as a purely biological act, \"no big deal\" and \"nothing,\" as her mother told her. But when she tries to do \"it\" with Randy in a boathouse, she becomes confused by scary feelings she did not know she had. She behaves defensively, like she doesn't want it. Randy, now also confused, is put off by her recalcitrance and leaves.\n\nAngel sees that sex is more than just a mechanical function she can cynically turn on and off. It involves feelings and caring and love. Sex is important, and something she deeply wants. As Randy leaves, she tearfully protests, \"But I ''like'' you!\"\n\nShe meets Randy a few days later with a much improved attitude\u2014one closer to Ferris's.  This time she pays attention, not to condoms and clothing, but to Randy and her feelings about him. As the novel describes it, \"All her fear and resistance melted as they kissed. Soon, she didn't know who was touching whom, only that it was wonderful and right and fine.\"\n\nAngel has sex in the boathouse, but doesn't tell the other girls. Ferris remains a virgin and lies about an evening of romantic passion (\"We had chilled Chablis; the darkness enveloped us.\")\n\nIn the end, Ferris discovers that love involves biological sex, which is not necessarily romantic, and Angel discovers that biological sex involves powerful emotions that touch her deeply and transform her soul. Finally, Angel becomes relaxed and happy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as Ferris Whitney\n* [[Kristy McNichol]] as Angel Bright\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Gary Callahan\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Randy Adams\n* [[Maggie Blye]] as Ms. Bright\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] as Mr. Whitney\n* [[Marianne Gordon]] as Mrs. Whitney\n* [[Krista Errickson]] as Cinder Carlson\n* [[Alexa Kenin]] as Dana\n* Mary Betten as Miss Nichols\n* Abby Bluestone as Chubby\n* Troas Hayes as Diane\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as Sunshine Walker\n* Simone Schachter as Carrots\n* Jenn Thompson as Penelope Schubert\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made by Stephen Friedman's King's Road Productions.

The signs and props built for the film remain for visitors to see. The gas station men's room (condom) scene was filmed in downtown [[Rutledge, Georgia|Rutledge]], the town nearest the park. The meeting place for the buses at the beginning and ending were filmed in a parking lot near the offices of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', and the old [[Omni Coliseum]] can be seen in the background including in the last scene of the movie. When Ferris is driven into town, they pass the [[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]], indicating that her family lives in [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]], a wealthy part of town to the north of the city.\n\n==Soundtrack and licensing issues==\nThe film was notable for having a contemporary pop soundtrack, with music by artists like [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Supertramp]], [[The Cars]], and [[Iain Matthews]].  The original video release\u2014on blue box VHS and laserdisc\u2014kept the soundtrack intact; however, many songs in the film such as Supertramp's \"School\", [[John Lennon]]'s \"Oh My Love\" and [[The Bellamy Brothers]]' \"Let Your Love Flow\" were removed from the second round of home releases\u2014VHS red box\u2014due to licensing issues, and were replaced with sound-alikes.\n\nOn January 7, 2012. [[Lionsgate]] announced the release of the film on [[DVD]], but it was later canceled.\n\nAs of 2019, the film has not been released on DVD or [[Blu-ray]], but was briefly available for digital video rental on iTunes and Amazon with the original soundtrack. Currently, it's been made available once again on [[Amazon Prime]], while [[Turner Classic Movies]] also aired the original theatrical version, letterboxed, and with all original music and credits intact.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film made $19.4 million domestically. It sold to network TV for $2.7 million and ancillary markets for $1.2 million meaning it made a profit.<ref name=\"loser\"/>\n\n''Little Darlings'' currently has a score of 57% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/little_darlings |title=Little Darlings |website=rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==TV version==\n''Little Darlings'' was shown on television in a heavily edited version which had all the sex-related scenes and dialogue removed, giving the impression that, instead of trying to lose their virginity, Angel and Ferris were engaged in competition simply to make a guy fall in love with them. The deleted scenes were replaced with alternate footage not seen in the theatrical version, including a scene in which Angel rescues Ferris from drowning in the lake during a  thunderstorm. Some additional music was also used in this version.

The film was marketed with the tagline \"Don't let the title fool you\", a reference to a scene in which Randy comments on Angel's name, to which Angel replies, \"Don't let the name fool you.\"\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] said of the film that it \"somehow does succeed in treating the awesome and scary subject of sexual initiation with some of the dignity it deserves.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800325/REVIEWS/3250301/1023 Little Darlings] By Roger Ebert, rogerebert.com, March 25, 1980</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of teenage girls from [[Atlanta]] go to summer camp, and, unbeknownst to the adults, two of them make a bet as to which one will lose her virginity first, with all the girls in camp betting money on the contest. The girls involved in the contest are opposites and rivals: cynical, suspicious and streetwise poor girl Angel Bright (played by Kristy McNichol) and naive, prissy and romantic rich girl Ferris Whitney (played by Tatum O\u2019Neal). The rest of the girls divide into two \"teams\", each rooting for and egging on either Ferris or Angel.  The two girls then choose  guys they want to lose their virginity with. Angel targets Randy, a boy from the camp across the lake, and Ferris attempts to seduce Gary Callahan, the (much older) camp counselor.\n\nThe girls also engage in typical teenage camp behavior, like food fights and singing around a campfire.\n\nBoth girls discover that sex is not what they thought it would be.\n\nFerris thinks of love as romance and wine and flowers.  She imagines herself swept off her feet by Gary.  When she lies about \"making love\" with him, the biological aspect manifests itself in Gary getting in trouble for having sex with a fifteen-year-old. She discovers that physical sex can have ugly consequences.  Her attitude is now more grounded in reality; she has become more like street-wise Angel.\n\nMeanwhile, street-wise Angel approaches the same issue from the other side and learns the opposite lesson. She views winning the contest as a purely biological act, \"no big deal\" and \"nothing,\" as her mother told her. But when she tries to do \"it\" with Randy in a boathouse, she becomes confused by scary feelings she did not know she had. She behaves defensively, like she doesn't want it. Randy, now also confused, is put off by her recalcitrance and leaves.\n\nAngel sees that sex is more than just a mechanical function she can cynically turn on and off. It involves feelings and caring and love. Sex is important, and something she deeply wants. As Randy leaves, she tearfully protests, \"But I ''like'' you!\"\n\nShe meets Randy a few days later with a much improved attitude\u2014one closer to Ferris's.  This time she pays attention, not to condoms and clothing, but to Randy and her feelings about him. As the novel describes it, \"All her fear and resistance melted as they kissed. Soon, she didn't know who was touching whom, only that it was wonderful and right and fine.\"\n\nAngel has sex in the boathouse, but doesn't tell the other girls. Ferris remains a virgin and lies about an evening of romantic passion (\"We had chilled Chablis; the darkness enveloped us.\")\n\nIn the end, Ferris discovers that love involves biological sex, which is not necessarily romantic, and Angel discovers that biological sex involves powerful emotions that touch her deeply and transform her soul. Finally, Angel becomes relaxed and happy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as Ferris Whitney\n* [[Kristy McNichol]] as Angel Bright\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Gary Callahan\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Randy Adams\n* [[Maggie Blye]] as Ms. Bright\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] as Mr. Whitney\n* [[Marianne Gordon]] as Mrs. Whitney\n* [[Krista Errickson]] as Cinder Carlson\n* [[Alexa Kenin]] as Dana\n* Mary Betten as Miss Nichols\n* Abby Bluestone as Chubby\n* Troas Hayes as Diane\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as Sunshine Walker\n* Simone Schachter as Carrots\n* Jenn Thompson as Penelope Schubert\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made by Stephen Friedman's King's Road Productions.

The signs and props built for the film remain for visitors to see. The gas station men's room (condom) scene was filmed in downtown [[Rutledge, Georgia|Rutledge]], the town nearest the park. The meeting place for the buses at the beginning and ending were filmed in a parking lot near the offices of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', and the old [[Omni Coliseum]] can be seen in the background including in the last scene of the movie. When Ferris is driven into town, they pass the [[Swan House (Atlanta)|Swan House]], indicating that her family lives in [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]], a wealthy part of town to the north of the city.\n\n==Soundtrack and licensing issues==\nThe film was notable for having a contemporary pop soundtrack, with music by artists like [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Supertramp]], [[The Cars]], and [[Iain Matthews]].  The original video release\u2014on blue box VHS and laserdisc\u2014kept the soundtrack intact, however, many songs in the film such as Supertramp's \"School\", [[John Lennon]]'s \"Oh My Love\" and [[The Bellamy Brothers]]' \"Let Your Love Flow\" were removed from the second round of home releases\u2014VHS red box\u2014due to licensing issues, and were replaced with sound-alikes.\n\nOn January 7, 2012. [[Lionsgate]] announced the release of the film on [[DVD]], but it was later canceled.\n\nAs of 2019, the film has not been released on DVD or [[Blu-ray]], but was briefly available for digital video rental on iTunes and Amazon with the original soundtrack. Currently, it's been made available once again on [[Amazon Prime]], while [[Turner Classic Movies]] also aired the original theatrical version, letterboxed, and with all original music and credits intact.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film made $19.4 million domestically. It sold to network TV for $2.7 million and ancillary markets for $1.2 million meaning it made a profit.<ref name=\"loser\"/>\n\n''Little Darlings'' currently has a score of 57% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/little_darlings |title=Little Darlings |website=rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==TV version==\n''Little Darlings'' was shown on television in a heavily edited version which had all the sex-related scenes and dialogue removed, giving the impression that, instead of trying to lose their virginity, Angel and Ferris were engaged in competition simply to make a guy fall in love with them. The deleted scenes were replaced with alternate footage not seen in the theatrical version, including a scene in which Angel rescues Ferris from drowning in the lake during a  thunderstorm. Some additional music was also used in this version. Director Ron Maxwell has stated that he had no participation in this TV version and does not approve of it.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*'''[[Young Artist Award]]s'''\n:'''Nominee:''' Second Best Young Actress in a Major Motion Picture - Kristy McNichol\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0081060|title=Little Darlings}}\n* {{tcmdb title|4679|Little Darlings}}\n* {{AllRovi title|id=77581|title=Little Darlings}}\n* {{Mojo title|littledarlings|Little Darlings}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|little_darlings|Little Darlings}}\n\n{{Ronald F.

The participants included a regular \"panel\" that appeared regularly on the show, and an additional guest participants related to the specific debate of each show. The show was canceled, but was inscribed in the Israeli public memory, following a unique Israeli outright-blatant style of debate that has evolved among the regular participants. The show is a milestone program, having formulated a new political-[[Talk show]] format.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Popolitica.JPG|thumb|250px|right|'Popolitica' 1993 show]]\n\nThe show was first aired in 1992, on the Israeli public [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]], formulated by producer Aaron Goldfinger, who envisioned a show in which political debates are taking place, and in the midst of these debates, small breaks that will include pop music, in an in-studio playing, that will be conducted by various singers and bands \u2013 and so the show was granted its name ''Popolitica'' (''Pop+Politics''). Within a short period of time, the show developed its characteristic format, and was regularly hosted by two veteran news and political show hosts, [[Nissim Mishal]] and later, [[Dan Margalit]], and included the regular following \"panel\": journalist [[Tommy Lapid]] (later made a political career out of his \"stardom\" as \"panelist\" of the show), journalist [[Amnon Dankner]], and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] journalist [[Yisrael Eichler]] (also later made a political career out of his \"panelist\" role). The pop songs were gradually thinned out until they were completely removed, in a way that only the political-debates format remained, the debates that had granted the show its fame.\n\nThe show was aired on Israeli channel 1 until 1998, when the \"panelists\" and the host left channel 1, and the show and its format were moved to the commercial [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]].\n\n=='Popolitica' style==\nThe panel team, who are known for their argumentative abilities and sharp tongues, have made waves among the Israeli public. The Israeli secular-right and conservative voice was represented by then Journalist Tommy Lapid, Journalist Amnon Dankner expressed the secular-liberal left, and Haredi Journalist Yisrael Eichler raised the voice of the Haredi sector. The characters of the panel team, as was reflected on the show, and other additional special guests with an argumentative style, that were brought for the purpose of each show's specific debate, have all together created a fermenting atmosphere, full of inflammation, while the host was not always able to control either the debate or sometimes even the panel or its special guests. Occasionally, at the hype of the argument, one participant would even leave the studio angrily, a \"live\" departure on television. In other occasions, the arguments came close to a skirmish event.\n\n=='Popolitica' legacy==\nThe show's style has gained high ratings but also conflicting reactions. Many reported loving to watch and listen to the arguments of the show, but others saw in it mainly an extreme expression of poor and cheap [[Populism]], aimed at glorifying the regular participants' abilities, while humiliating people with different political opinions or some who are not accustomed to such loud debates. The show's style was inscribed in the Israeli public memory, and its format-style was later reflected on many other political-debate shows, which have practically continued the original 'Popolitica' show, with its noisy debates, that makes an impression on the audience and gains high ratings. The word 'Popolitica' was coined in Israel as a synonym for [[Populism]] and [[Demagogy]]; It is being used when one wants to describe an inflammated argument with a fluent spokes people who use an outright-blatant style.\n\nThe show also coined some famous quotes: \"I didn't interrupt you - you don't interrupt me!\" ({{lang-he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05da, \u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d9}}), or, \"Let me finish a sentence\" ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d2\u05de\u05d5\u05e8 \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8}})\n\n==The program, its \"panel\" and 'Moetzet HaHakhamim' show==\n'Popolitica' was canceled and other Israeli channels attempted to revive its format-style under new program names.

''Council of [Toarh] Scholars''). Haredi Journalist Yisrael Eichler has retired from the old-new show, and his place was filled, for a short period of time, by the Haredi well-known politician [[Aryeh Deri]].

By 1875, there were four different railroad stations, making passenger transfers between different railroad lines inconvenient. To remedy this issue, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] proposed creating one central \"Union Station\" to combine the various operations. In February 1880, the owners of the four lines (the Union Pacific, the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Western]], the [[Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad|Denver, South Park & Pacific]] and the [[Colorado Central Railroad|Colorado Central]]) agreed to build a station at 17th and Wynkoop Streets. Architect A. Taylor of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] was hired to develop the plans and the station opened in May 1881.<ref>Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974; p. 2.</ref>\n\nA fire that started in the women's restroom in 1894 destroyed the central portion of the 1881 depot. The Kansas City architectural firm of [[Van Brunt & Howe]] was hired to design a larger replacement depot in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival style]]. Both the 1881 and 1894 depots included a tall central [[clock towers|clock tower]] with four clock faces.<ref>Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974, p. 3.</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nOn July 4, 1906, a large arch was dedicated in front of the station in order to provide a symbolic threshold for travelers entering and leaving the city.<ref name=\"StationTimeline\"/> Constructed at a cost of $22,500 with 70 tons of steel and over 2,000 light bulbs, the arch originally featured the word \"Welcome\" on both sides. The elevation facing 17th Street was changed to \"[[Mizpah (emotional bond)|Mizpah]]\", a Hebrew word expressing an emotional bond between separated people, and used as a farewell to people leaving Denver.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_14021344| title=Mizpah Arch: A gateway to Denver's past and future| last=Rinaldi| first=Ray Mark| date=December 20, 2009| newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]| accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the original Union Depot partnership was dissolved and replaced by the Denver Terminal Railway Company, representing the then-major operators of the station (the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe]], the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]], the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific]], the [[Colorado and Southern Railway|Colorado & Southern]], the Union Pacific and the Denver & Rio Grande Western railways). The new partnership decided to demolish and rebuild the central portion of the station to handle the increasing passenger traffic.

The train hall stands immediately behind the historic building and houses tracks for Amtrak and the commuter rail lines. An entrance between the train hall and the historic building lead directly to the underground bus terminal, which stretches west for two city blocks along 17th Street until it terminates at an above-ground light rail station. Street-level pavilions at the light rail stop/Chestnut Place, Wewatta Street and at each platform in the train hall provide additional vertical circulation to the bus terminal.\n\nEach of these transportation elements are tied together above ground by major public spaces and landscape elements such as the 17 St. Promenade/Gardens, Wynkoop Plaza and several other public plazas.\n\nHistorically, a subterranean passage accessed through the northern wing building connected the station to the old rail platforms above. However, the passage and its entrance was demolished with the construction of the bus terminal.\n\n===Historic building===\n[[File:Denver Union Station Great Hall Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of the renovated Great Hall]]\nThe present-day Union Station building consists mainly of two lower wing buildings flanking a larger central mass built during different parts of the station's history. The wing buildings were built with the first 1881 structure in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, featuring tall, narrow windows, [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] stonework and motifs of Colorado's state flower, the [[Aquilegia coerulea|columbine]]. When the station was gutted by the 1894 fire, the facades of the wing buildings were incorporated into the 1894 depot and the 1914 renovation. They originally functioned as offices and other facilities for the station through its history, although today the structures house guestrooms for the Crawford Hotel and several restaurants.\n\nWhen originally constructed, the Great Hall also included three large chandeliers and ten long wooden benches that incorporated heating and lighting into their framework. While the renovation saw the return of similar chandeliers as the originals, it also saw the removal of the benches due to [[asbestos]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther modifications made during 2012 included changing the brown and tan color scheme of the interior to a more neutral white. The old ticket counters and offices were also converted into the Terminal Bar along with several retail and restaurant spaces being created on the periphery of and opening on to the Great Hall. In general, the 2012 renovation sought to create \"Denver's Living Room\" in the Great Hall by diversifying its functions.<ref>{{cite magazine|

By 1875, there were four different railroad stations, making passenger transfers between different railroad lines inconvenient. To remedy this issue, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] proposed creating one central \"Union Station\" to combine the various operations. In February 1880, the owners of the four lines (the Union Pacific, the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Western]], the [[Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad|Denver, South Park & Pacific]] and the [[Colorado Central Railroad|Colorado Central]]) agreed to build a station at 17th and Wynkoop Streets. Architect A. Taylor of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] was hired to develop the plans and the station opened in May 1881.<ref>Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974; p. 2.</ref>\n\nA fire that started in the women's restroom in 1894 destroyed the central portion of the 1881 depot. The Kansas City architectural firm of [[Van Brunt & Howe]] was hired to design a larger replacement depot in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival style]]. Both the 1881 and 1894 depots included a tall central [[clock towers|clock tower]] with four clock faces.<ref>Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974, p. 3.</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nOn July 4, 1906, a large arch was dedicated in front of the station in order to provide a symbolic threshold for travelers entering and leaving the city.<ref name=\"StationTimeline\"/> Constructed at a cost of $22,500 with 70 tons of steel and over 2,000 light bulbs, the arch originally featured the word \"Welcome\" on both sides. The elevation facing 17th Street was changed to \"[[Mizpah (emotional bond)|Mizpah]]\", a Hebrew word expressing an emotional bond between separated people, and used as a farewell to people leaving Denver.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_14021344| title=Mizpah Arch: A gateway to Denver's past and future| last=Rinaldi| first=Ray Mark| date=December 20, 2009| newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]| accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the original Union Depot partnership was dissolved and replaced by the Denver Terminal Railway Company, representing the then-major operators of the station (the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe]], the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]], the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific]], the [[Colorado and Southern Railway|Colorado & Southern]], the Union Pacific and the Denver & Rio Grande Western railways). The new partnership decided to demolish and rebuild the central portion of the station to handle the increasing passenger traffic. The new central portion, designed by Denver architects Gove & Walsh, was built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style and opened in 1914.<ref>Fraser, Clayton, and Jennifer Strand.

As a result of growing passenger service, the Mizpah Arch in front of the station was deemed a traffic hazard and was torn down in 1931.<ref name=\"StationTimeline\"/>\n\n===Late 20th century: Decline===\n[[File:6 More of Roger Puta's Rio Grande Zephyr Photos (27115366481).jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Rio Grande Zephyr]]'' at Union Station, 1980]]\n[[File:Denver Ski Train 2003.jpg|thumb|left|Denver Ski Train, 2003]]\nAlthough World War II saw a surge in [[Rail transportation in the United States|rail traffic]], the latter half of the 20th century saw a sharp decline in service for Union Station and countless other train stations in the United States as competition began to grow from automobiles and airlines.\n\nFor the first time in 1958, passenger traffic at [[Stapleton International Airport]] exceeded that of Union Station. It was during this period that the orange \"Union Station: Travel by Train\" signs were placed on both sides of the building to advertise intercity rail travel.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rtd-fastracks.com/dus_14| title=Denver Union Station Facts: Current, Historical and Fun| accessdate=December 19, 2014| website=RTD Fastracks| publisher=Regional Transportation District}}</ref>\n\n[[Amtrak]] eventually became the sole provider of rail service through the station, operating only two trains daily between [[Chicago]] and the [[Bay Area]] with the ''[[California Zephyr]]''.

The train hall stands immediately behind the historic building and houses tracks for Amtrak and the commuter rail lines. An entrance between the train hall and the historic building lead directly to the underground bus terminal, which stretches west for two city blocks along 17th Street until it terminates at an above-ground light rail station. Street-level pavilions at the light rail stop/Chestnut Place, Wewatta Street and at each platform in the train hall provide additional vertical circulation to the bus terminal.\n\nEach of these transportation elements are tied together above ground by major public spaces and landscape elements such as the 17 St. Promenade/Gardens, Wynkoop Plaza and several other public plazas.\n\nHistorically, a subterranean passage accessed through the northern wing building connected the station to the old rail platforms above. However, the passage and its entrance was demolished with the construction of the bus terminal.\n\n===Historic building===\n[[File:Denver Union Station Great Hall Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of the renovated Great Hall]]\nThe present-day Union Station building consists mainly of two lower wing buildings flanking a larger central mass built during different parts of the station's history. The wing buildings were built with the first 1881 structure in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, featuring tall, narrow windows, [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] stonework and motifs of Colorado's state flower, the [[Aquilegia coerulea|columbine]]. When the station was gutted by the 1894 fire, the facades of the wing buildings were incorporated into the 1894 depot and the 1914 renovation. They originally functioned as offices and other facilities for the station through its history, although today the structures house guestrooms for the Crawford Hotel and several restaurants.\n\nWhen originally constructed, the Great Hall also included three large chandeliers and ten long wooden benches that incorporated heating and lighting into their framework.
