[[Dorset]], England. It was created on 1 April 2019 by the merger of the areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth]] and [[Poole]], and the [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|author=Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=2018-05-28|website=legislation.gov.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525193043/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made#|archive-date=2018-05-25|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> The authority covers much of the area of the [[South East Dorset conurbation|South Dorset conurbation]].\n\n==Background==\nBournemouth and Christchurch were [[Historic counties of England|historically]] part of the County of [[Hampshire]], whilst Poole was a part of Dorset. However, by the mid 20th century the area had begun to coalesce as a [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|conurbation]], and in the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 Local Government Act]], the three areas were brought together under the [[Ceremonial counties of England|Ceremonial County]] of Dorset, whilst still forming separate districts. In 1997 Poole and Bournemouth became unitary authorities, whilst Christchurch remained within Dorset County Council.\n\nThe new authority was formed as a result of [[2019\u201321 structural changes to local government in England|local government reorganisation]] in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Under the plans, dubbed \"Future Dorset\", all councils within the county were abolished and replaced with two new unitary authorities. One was formed from the existing unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth Borough Council|Bournemouth]] and [[Poole Borough Council|Poole]], which merged with the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to create the unitary authority to be known as Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The other was created from the merger of the existing non-metropolitan districts of [[Weymouth and Portland]], [[West Dorset]], [[North Dorset]], [[Purbeck District|Purbeck]] and [[East Dorset]] to form a new [[Dorset (unitary authority)|Dorset]] authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531065217/https://futuredorset.co.uk/#|archive-date=2018-05-31|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nChristchurch Borough Council formally opposed the plans, whilst every other existing authority in Dorset supported the plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584|title=Council submits alternative to merger|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Christchurch Borough Council unsuccessfully challenged the proposals in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810|title=Council's merger appeal bid refused|date=2018-08-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024818/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Several [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Councillors in Christchurch were suspended from the party for their opposition to the plan, with several of them subsequently standing as independents in the 2019 election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-47536891|title=Tories suspended over merger row|date=2019-03-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>.\n\n==Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council==\n{{main|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council}}\nStatutory instruments for the creation of the new authority were made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 25 May 2018, and a shadow authority was formed the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-44250570|title=Parliament passes councils merger plan|date=25 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/historic-day-as-parliamentary-process-to-create-new-councils-concludes/|title=Historic day, as Parliamentary process to create new councils concludes - Future Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk}}</ref> The Shadow Authority was composed of the existing borough councillors from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, as well as the County Councillors representing Christchurch.

The first elections took place in 2019 alongside other local elections, and led to the Conservatives holding the most seats, but lacking a majority, meaning that the council remained under [[No overall control]]. Subsequent to the election, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the second largest party in the council, led the creation of the Unity Alliance Administration, made up of the Liberal Democrats (15), [[Independent politician|Independents]] (11), [[Poole People Party|Poole People]] (7), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (3), [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] (2) and Alliance for Local Living (1). The Unity Alliance therefore had 39 members, the number required for a majority. The remaining councillors, belonging to the Conservative Party (36) and [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] (1) remained in opposition.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main articles|History of Bournemouth|History of Christchurch, Dorset|History of Poole}}\nThe area around Poole Harbour has been inhabited for at least around 2,500 years<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Cochrane|first=C|title=Poole Bay and Purbeck, 300BC to AD1660|publisher=Longman|year=|isbn=0-905868-14-5|location=|pages=}}</ref>, with the Durotriges, a Celtic groups, settling the Dorset area in the Iron Age. The area continued to be important during Roman Rule, with Poole being one of the areas Roman troops landed<ref name=\":0\" />, and with the Second Augustan Legion under Emperor Vespasian founding Hamworthy in 43AD<ref>{{Cite book|last=Legg, Rodney.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61177082|title=The book of Poole : harbour and town|date=2005|publisher=Halsgrove|isbn=1-84114-411-8|location=Tiverton, Devon|oclc=61177082}}</ref>, which today lies in the Southeast of the authority. Following the initial Saxon invasions in the 7th century, the area came under the Kingdom of Wessex. As shires developed, the area now covering Christchurch and Bournemouth became part of Hampshire (the Shire of Southampton) whilst Poole became part of Dorset.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe authority lies in the South East of the ceremonial county of Dorset around 150 km from London. Dorset as a whole is part of the [[South West England|South West]] [[Regions of England|region of England]], which is used for [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|statistical purposes]]. The three former boroughs are all historically seaside towns with tourism playing an important part in the local economy. Bournemouth and Poole lie north of [[Poole Harbour]], whilst Christchurch contains [[Christchurch Harbour]], with the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Solent]] to the East and [[English Channel]] to the South and West.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole has an Oceanic Temperate Climate. The presence of the [[Gulf Stream]] ensures that the [[British Isles]] maintain an all-year-round ambient temperature, and, because of its position on the south coast of England, the area has slightly warmer winters and cooler summers than settlements further inland.{{Weather box\n| location = [[Bournemouth Airport|Bournemouth Hurn]] {{convert|10|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} [[Above sea level|asl]], 1981\u20132010,{{refn|In accordance with World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations, the Met Office maintains long-term averages of the UK climate, based on standard 30-year periods.

[[Dorset]], England. It was created on 1 April 2019 by the merger of the areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth]] and [[Poole]], and the [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|author=Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=2018-05-28|website=legislation.gov.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525193043/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/648/contents/made#|archive-date=2018-05-25|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> The authority covers much of the area of the [[South East Dorset conurbation|South Dorset conurbation]].\n\n==Background==\nBournemouth and Christchurch were [[Historic counties of England|historically]] part of the County of [[Hampshire]], whilst Poole was a part of Dorset. However, by the mid 20th century the area had begun to coalesce as a [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|conurbation]], and in the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 Local Government Act]], the three areas were brought together under the [[Ceremonial counties of England|Ceremonial County]] of Dorset, whilst still forming separate districts. In 1997 Poole and Bournemouth became unitary authorities, whilst Christchurch remained within Dorset County Council.\n\nThe new authority was formed as a result of [[2019\u201321 structural changes to local government in England|local government reorganisation]] in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Under the plans, dubbed \"Future Dorset\", all councils within the county were abolished and replaced with two new unitary authorities. One was formed from the existing unitary authorities of [[Bournemouth Borough Council|Bournemouth]] and [[Poole Borough Council|Poole]], which merged with the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to create the unitary authority to be known as Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The other was created from the merger of the existing non-metropolitan districts of [[Weymouth and Portland]], [[West Dorset]], [[North Dorset]], [[Purbeck District|Purbeck]] and [[East Dorset]] to form a new [[Dorset (unitary authority)|Dorset]] authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531065217/https://futuredorset.co.uk/#|archive-date=2018-05-31|url-status=live|df=}}</ref>\n\nChristchurch Borough Council formally opposed the plans, whilst every other existing authority in Dorset supported the plans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584|title=Council submits alternative to merger|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-42583584#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Christchurch Borough Council unsuccessfully challenged the proposals in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810|title=Council's merger appeal bid refused|date=2018-08-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109024818/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-45141810#|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Several [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Councillors in Christchurch were suspended from the party for their opposition to the plan, with several of them subsequently standing as independents in the 2019 election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-47536891|title=Tories suspended over merger row|date=2019-03-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-19|language=en-GB}}</ref>.\n\n==Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council==\n{{main|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council}}\nStatutory instruments for the creation of the new authority were made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 25 May 2018, and a shadow authority was formed the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-44250570|title=Parliament passes councils merger plan|date=25 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/historic-day-as-parliamentary-process-to-create-new-councils-concludes/|title=Historic day, as Parliamentary process to create new councils concludes - Future Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk}}</ref> The Shadow Authority was composed of the existing borough councillors from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, as well as the County Councillors representing Christchurch.

The first elections took place in 2019 alongside other local elections, and led to the Conservatives holding the most seats, but lacking a majority, meaning that the council remained under [[No overall control]]. Subsequent to the election, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the second largest party in the council, led the creation of the Unity Alliance Administration, made up of the Liberal Democrats (15), [[Independent politician|Independents]] (11), [[Poole People Party|Poole People]] (7), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] (3), [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] (2) and Alliance for Local Living (1). The Unity Alliance therefore had 39 members, the number required for a majority. The remaining councillors, belonging to the Conservative Party (36) and [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] (1) remained in opposition.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main articles|History of Bournemouth|History of Christchurch, Dorset|History of Poole}}\nThe area around Poole Harbour has been inhabited for at least around 2,500 years<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Cochrane|first=C|title=Poole Bay and Purbeck, 300BC to AD1660|publisher=Longman|year=|isbn=0-905868-14-5|location=|pages=}}</ref>, with the Durotriges, a Celtic groups, settling the Dorset area in the Iron Age. The area continued to be important during Roman Rule, with Poole being one of the areas Roman troops landed<ref name=\":0\" />, and with the Second Augustan Legion under Emperor Vespasian founding Hamworthy in 43AD<ref>{{Cite book|last=Legg, Rodney.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61177082|title=The book of Poole : harbour and town|date=2005|publisher=Halsgrove|isbn=1-84114-411-8|location=Tiverton, Devon|oclc=61177082}}</ref>, which today lies in the Southeast of the authority. Following the initial Saxon invasions in the 7th century, the area came under the Kingdom of Wessex. As shires developed, the area now covering Christchurch and Bournemouth became part of Hampshire (the Shire of Southampton) whilst Poole became part of Dorset.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe authority lies in the South East of the ceremonial county of Dorset around 150 km from London. Dorset as a whole is part of the [[South West England|South West]] [[Regions of England|region of England]], which is used for [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|statistical purposes]]. The three former boroughs are all historically seaside towns with tourism playing an important part in the local economy. Bournemouth and Poole lie north of [[Poole Harbour]], whilst Christchurch contains [[Christchurch Harbour]], with the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Solent]] to the East and [[English Channel]] to the South and West.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole has an Oceanic Temperate Climate. The presence of the [[Gulf Stream]] ensures that the [[British Isles]] maintain an all-year-round ambient temperature, and, because of its position on the south coast of England, the area has slightly warmer winters and cooler summers than settlements further inland.{{Weather box\n| location = [[Bournemouth Airport|Bournemouth Hurn]] {{convert|10|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} [[Above sea level|asl]], 1981\u20132010,{{refn|In accordance with World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations, the Met Office maintains long-term averages of the UK climate, based on standard 30-year periods.

The other comment also commented that she is kept on sticking with Song Ga-in even after 'Miss Trot' had ended. In addition, the person who wrote the comment also asked why she would do that when she was not at the same level as Song Ga-in. Hong Ja did not acknowledge all the above hate comments.\n|-\n|Park Sung-yeon\n|A comment asked if Sung-yeon has any connection since she did not reach Top 5 on the survival show, but she still appears on TV. Hence, for this statement, she refuted by saying that her company is too small for any connection. Another comment said that she got a full makeover which she agreed and admitted that she indeed went for plastic surgery before her debut. Sung-yeon disagreed the next statement which commented on her teeth being yellow, and said that she should just get them whitened. Lastly, she disagreed another comment pointing on her dancing while singing trot song on an event which ruined the whole trot music.\n|-\n|3\n|July 5\n|[[Jun Jin]] ([[Shinhwa]])<br />{{illm|Kim Seung-hyun (actor)|lt=Kim Seung-hyun|ko|\uae40\uc2b9\ud604 (\ubc30\uc6b0)}}\n|\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sisamagazine.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=210207|title='\uc545\ud50c\uc758 \ubc24' 5\uc77c \ubc29\uc1a1\uc5d0\ub294 90\ub144\ub300 \uc808\uce5c \ub77c\uc778... - \uc2dc\uc0ac\ub9e4\uac70\uc9c4|last=\uae30\uc790|first=\uc8fc\uc9c4\ud604|date=1970-01-01|website=www.sisamagazine.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvreport.co.kr/1137954|title='\uc545\ud50c\uc758 \ubc24' \uc804\uc9c4\u00b7\uae40\uc2b9\ud604\uc774 \ubc1d\ud78c #\uacb0\ud63c #\uc5f4\uc560 \uace0\ubc31 #\uc124\ub9ac \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 [\uc885\ud569]|website=TV\ub9ac\ud3ec\ud2b8|language=ko|access-date=2019-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903024456/https://www.tvreport.co.kr/1137954|archive-date=September 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n|4\n|July 12\n|[[Kim Ji-min (comedian)|Kim Ji-min]]<br />[[Sandeul]] ([[B1A4]])\n|\n|\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mosen.mt.co.kr/article/G1111184806|title='\uc545\ud50c\uc758 \ubc24' \uc124\ub9ac \"\uacf5\uac1c\uc5f0\uc560 \ud6c4\ud68c \uc548\ud574..\ub9cc\ub098\uba74 \ubc25 \uc0ac\uc8fc\uace0 \uc2f6\ub2e4\"[\ud56bTV]|last=OSEN|date=2019-07-13|website=mosen.mt.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2019-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713004724/http://mosen.mt.co.kr/article/G1111184806|archive-date=July 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xportsnews.com/?ac=article_view&entry_id=1140268|title=&quot;'\uc545\ud50c\uc758 \ubc24' \uae40\uc9c0\ubbfcX\uc0b0\ub4e4, \uc678\ubaa8\u2192\uc2e4\ub825 \uc545\ud50c\uae4c\uc9c0\u2026\uc720\ucf8c\ud55c \ub300\ucc98 [\uc885\ud569]|date=2019-07-12|website=www.xportsnews.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2|5\n|rowspan=2|July 19\n|rowspan=2|[[Shin Ji]] ([[Koyote]])<br />{{illm|Seunghee|ko|\uc2b9\ud76c (1996\ub144)}} ([[Oh My Girl]])\n|Shin Ji\n|She disagrees a comment which asked what had she done to make her face so messed up, one side is collapsing, and the other is too firm.
