The episcopal see is the [[Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Portsmouth|Portsmouth Cathedral]] and is headed by the [[Bishop of Portsmouth (Catholic)|Bishop of Portsmouth]]. The diocese is part of the metropolitan [[Province of Southwark]], which covers all of the far [[South of England]] as well as the Channel Islands.\n\n==Location==\nThe Diocese of Portsmouth, situated centrally within the [[Archdiocese of Southwark|Metropolitan Province of Southwark]], extending as far as [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] in the North; and down to and including the [[Channel Islands]] in the South, and roughly from Liphook in the East to [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]] in the West. The diocese adjoins the dioceses of [[Archdiocese of Birmingham|Birmingham]] and [[Diocese of Northampton|Northampton]] to the North, the [[Diocese of Arundel and Brighton|diocese of Arundel & Brighton]] to the East and the dioceses of [[Diocese of Plymouth|Plymouth]] and [[Diocese of Clifton|Clifton]] to the West. It officially comprises the counties of [[Hampshire]], Berkshire (south of the Thames), [[Oxfordshire]] (south of the Thames), [[Dorset]] (the Bournemouth area), the [[Isle of Wight]] and the Channel Islands.\n\nThe area of the Diocese of Portsmouth is 6,339&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2,447sq Miles) with a total population (2001 census) of 2,960,077. Its estimated Catholic population (2004) is 167,000. There are 112 parishes (2005) and 128 incardinated priests, with a further 86 from religious orders, congregations & societies. There are also 31 permanent deacons serving in the parishes plus 101 professed, non-priest religious and 255 professed women religious. Education comprises 48 primary/middle/ecumenical schools (aided and grant maintained), 8 secondary and 24 independent schools.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Portsmouthcatholiccathedral.jpg|thumb|St John's Cathedral, Portsmouth|alt=]]\nBy a Papal Brief dated 19 May 1882, [[Pope Leo XIII]] created the Diocese of Portsmouth. It was formed out of the western portion of the Diocese of Southwark, as constituted at the re-establishment of the hierarchy in 1850.<ref name=king>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12296a.htm King, John Henry. \"Diocese of Portsmouth.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12.

It was thus almost co-terminous with the limits of the (Anglican) [[Diocese of Winchester]]. The obvious place for the cathedral and curia of the new diocese was Winchester. The [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] see. It would appear that the original intention was to fix the see at [[Southampton]], with [[St Joseph Church, Southampton|St Joseph Church]] in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral. The construction of a large parish church in the centre of [[Portsmouth]] had begun, and it was decided to make it the future cathedral of the diocese.<ref name=hist>{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholicassociation.co.uk/groups/porthist.shtml|title = History of Portsmouth Diocese|accessdate = 13 December 2014|website = [[Catholic Association Pilgrimage]]|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210531/http://www.catholicassociation.co.uk/groups/porthist.shtml|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBishop Vertue was succeeded by his vicar-general [[John Cahill (bishop)|John Cahill]].

The episcopal see is the [[Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Portsmouth|Portsmouth Cathedral]] and is headed by the [[Bishop of Portsmouth (Catholic)|Bishop of Portsmouth]]. The diocese is part of the metropolitan [[Province of Southwark]], which covers all of the far [[South of England]] as well as the Channel Islands.\n\n==Location==\nThe Diocese of Portsmouth, situated centrally within the [[Archdiocese of Southwark|Metropolitan Province of Southwark]], extending as far as [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] in the North; and down to and including the [[Channel Islands]] in the South, and roughly from Liphook in the East to [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]] in the West. The diocese adjoins the dioceses of [[Archdiocese of Birmingham|Birmingham]] and [[Diocese of Northampton|Northampton]] to the North, the [[Diocese of Arundel and Brighton|diocese of Arundel & Brighton]] to the East and the dioceses of [[Diocese of Plymouth|Plymouth]] and [[Diocese of Clifton|Clifton]] to the West. It officially comprises the counties of [[Hampshire]], Berkshire (south of the Thames), [[Oxfordshire]] (south of the Thames), [[Dorset]] (the Bournemouth area), the [[Isle of Wight]] and the Channel Islands.\n\nThe area of the Diocese of Portsmouth is 6,339&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2,447sq Miles) with a total population (2001 census) of 2,960,077. Its estimated Catholic population (2004) is 167,000. There are 112 parishes (2005) and 128 incardinated priests, with a further 86 from religious orders, congregations & societies. There are also 31 permanent deacons serving in the parishes plus 101 professed, non-priest religious and 255 professed women religious. Education comprises 48 primary/middle/ecumenical schools (aided and grant maintained), 8 secondary and 24 independent schools.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Portsmouthcatholiccathedral.jpg|thumb|St John's Cathedral, Portsmouth|alt=]]\nBy a Papal Brief dated 19 May 1882, [[Pope Leo XIII]] created the Diocese of Portsmouth. It was formed out of the western portion of the Diocese of Southwark, as constituted at the re-establishment of the hierarchy in 1850.<ref name=king>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12296a.htm King, John Henry. \"Diocese of Portsmouth.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 January 2020{{PD-notice}}</ref> The Southwark diocese had become too large for one bishop, extending as it did from London to [[Bournemouth]] and from the outskirts of [[Oxford]] to [[Dover]] and including the Channel Islands.\n\nThe new diocese comprised the counties of [[Hampshire]], the [[Isle of Wight]], Berkshire, and the [[Channel Islands]]. It was thus almost co-terminous with the limits of the (Anglican) [[Diocese of Winchester]]. The obvious place for the cathedral and curia of the new diocese was Winchester. The [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] see. It would appear that the original intention was to fix the see at [[Southampton]], with [[St Joseph Church, Southampton|St Joseph Church]] in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral. The construction of a large parish church in the centre of [[Portsmouth]] had begun, and it was decided to make it the future cathedral of the diocese.<ref name=hist>{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholicassociation.co.uk/groups/porthist.shtml|title = History of Portsmouth Diocese|accessdate = 13 December 2014|website = [[Catholic Association Pilgrimage]]|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210531/http://www.catholicassociation.co.uk/groups/porthist.shtml|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBishop Vertue was succeeded by his vicar-general [[John Cahill (bishop)|John Cahill]].

Several [[eurozone]] member states ([[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]] and [[Cyprus]]) were unable to repay or refinance their [[government debt]] or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other [[eurozone countries]], the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), or the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).\n\nThe eurozone crisis was caused by a [[Currency crisis|balance-of-payments crisis]] (a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that had substantial deficits and were dependent on foreign lending). The crisis was worsened by the inability of states to resort to [[devaluation]] (reductions in the value of the national currency).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Debt accumulation in some eurozone members was in part due to macroeconomic differences among eurozone member states prior to the adoption of the euro. The European Central Bank adopted an interest rate that incentivized investors in Northern eurozone members to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow (because interest rates were very low). Over time, this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South, primarily by private economic actors.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A lack of fiscal policy coordination among eurozone member states contributed to imbalanced capital flows in the eurozone.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A lack of financial regulatory centralization or harmonization among eurozone states, coupled with a lack of credible commitments to bailout banks, incentivized risky financial transactions by banks.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The detailed causes of the crisis varied from country to country. In several countries, private debts arising from a property [[Economic bubble|bubble]] were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system [[bailout]]s and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.<ref name=\"Seth W.

The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering [[interest rates]] and providing cheap loans of more than one trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering [[Outright Monetary Transactions]] (OMT).<ref name=\"ecb\">[http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html \"Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions\"], [[European Central Bank|ECB]] Press Release, 6 September 2012</ref> Ireland and Portugal received EU-IMF bailouts In November 2010 and May 2011, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> In March 2012, Greece received its second bailout.

Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014. Spain never officially received a bailout programme.

There is a consensus that the root of the eurozone crisis lay in a [[Currency crisis|balance-of-payments crisis]] (a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that were dependent on foreign lending), and that this crisis was worsened by the fact that states could not resort to [[devaluation]] (reductions in the value of the national currency to make exports more competitive in foreign markets).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Copelovitch|first=Mark|last2=Frieden|first2=Jeffry|last3=Walter|first3=Stefanie|date=2016-03-14|title=The Political Economy of the Euro Crisis|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414016633227|journal=Comparative Political Studies|language=en-US|volume=49|issue=7|pages=811\u2013840|doi=10.1177/0010414016633227|issn=0010-4140}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry|last2=Walter|first2=Stefanie|date=2017-05-11|title=Understanding the Political Economy of the Eurozone Crisis|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023101|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=20|issue=1|pages=371\u2013390|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023101|issn=1094-2939}}</ref> Other important factors include the [[Financialization|globalisation of finance]]; easy credit conditions during the 2002\u20132008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]; international trade imbalances; [[real estate bubble]]s that have since burst; the [[Great Recession]] of 2008\u20132012; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.\n\nMacroeconomic divergence among eurozone member states led to imbalanced capital flows between the member states. Prior to the adoption of the euro, Southern eurozone member states grew rapidly (with rising wages and prices) whereas Northern eurozone members grew slowly. Despite these different macroeconomic conditions, the European Central Bank could only adopt one interest rate, choosing one that meant that real interest rates in Germany were high (relative to inflation) and low in Southern eurozone member states. This incentivized investors in Germany to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow (because interest rates were very low).

In the eurozone, each country had its own financial regulations, which allowed financial institutions to exploit gaps in monitoring and regulatory responsibility to resort to loans that were high-yield but very risky. Harmonization or centralization in financial regulations could have alleviated the problem of risky loans. Another factor that incentivized risky financial transaction was that national governments could not credibly commit not to bailout financial institutions who had undertaken risky loans, thus causing

When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a [[bailout]].<ref name=raiff>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9830fa0c-e809-11dd-b2a5-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz2u0Q66WnT |title=FT: \"Banks ask for crisis funds for eastern Europe\" 22 Jan 2009 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> At the time, the [[European Commission]] released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse.<ref name=raiff/><ref name=\"The Euro's Three Crises\">{{cite journal |title=The Euro's Three Crises |journal=Jay C.

The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and [[potential output|potential growth]]; [[Competition (companies)|competitive weakness]]; [[liquidation]] of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).<ref>P.E.

This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or [[refinance]] existing [[government debt]], particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, as in the case of Greece and Portugal.\n\nThe states that were adversely affected by the crisis faced a strong rise in interest rate spreads for government bonds as a result of investor concerns about their future debt sustainability. Four eurozone states had to be rescued by sovereign bailout programs, which were provided jointly by the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[European Commission]], with additional support at the technical level from the [[European Central Bank]]. Together these three international organisations representing the bailout creditors became nicknamed \"the [[European Troika|Troika]]\".\n\nTo fight the crisis some governments have focused on raising taxes and lowering expenditures, which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists, many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling. Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply, a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond [[yield spread]]s and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other [[EU member states]], most importantly Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d25573c-1ccc-11df-8d8e-00144feab49a.html |title=Gilt yields rise amid UK debt concerns |last1=Oakley |first1=David |last2=Hope |first2=Kevin |work=Financial Times |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> By the end of 2011, Germany was estimated to have made more than {{Nowrap|\u20ac9 billion}} out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate German federal government bonds (''bunds'').<ref name=\"euo_09112011\">{{cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/19/114231 |title=Germany estimated to have made \u20ac9 billion profit out of crisis |author=Valentina Pop |date=9 November 2011 |newspaper=[[EUobserver]] |accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> By July 2012 also the Netherlands, Austria, and Finland benefited from zero or negative interest rates.

The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.\n\nThe turmoil of the [[Great Recession]] lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> What was exceptional for Greece, was that the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was simultaneously coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP - as calculated after all corrections).<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name=\"Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat\">{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=teina225&language=en|title= Eurostat (Government debt data)|work= Eurostat |date= |accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref> In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]]. Finally, a role was played by controversies about Greek statistics (due to the aforementioned revisions), and, possibly, by an effect of [[Greek government-debt crisis#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was \"punished\" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making impossible for the country to finance its debt.\n\nDespite the drastic upwards revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit in October 2009, Greek borrowing rates initially rose rather slowly. By April 2010 it was apparent that the country was becoming unable to borrow from the markets; on 23 April 2010, the Greek government requested an initial loan of {{Nowrap|\u20ac45 billion}} from the

A country that runs a large current account or trade deficit (i.e., importing more than it exports) must ultimately be a net importer of capital; this is a mathematical [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] called the [[balance of payments]].\nIn other words, a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. Conversely, Germany's large trade surplus (net export position) means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries to allow them to buy German goods.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/20/AR2010052005278.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Steven |last=Pearlstein |title=Forget Greece: Europe's real problem is Germany |date=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 trade deficits for Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal were estimated to be $42.96bn, $75.31bn and $35.97bn, and $25.6bn respectively, while Germany's trade surplus was $188.6bn.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html |title=CIA Factbook-Data |publisher=CIA |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> A similar imbalance exists in the US, which runs a large trade deficit (net import position) and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad.

This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.<ref name=CNN01/>\n\nEither way, many of the countries involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit.<ref name=CNN01>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/09/07/247884/index.htm |publisher=CNN |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Saving Asia: It's Time To Get Radical |date=7 September 1998}}</ref> It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.\nOn the other hand, export driven countries with a large trade surplus, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption.<ref name=\"MWBOP\">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/396ff020-1ffd-11e1-8662-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1fwLi3F1I |title=Merkozy failed to save the eurozone |work=Financial Times |author=Martin Wolf |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2011|author-link=Martin Wolf }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/eu-gipfel-und-der-kampf-um-den-euro-starker-mann-was-nun-1.1229181 |newspaper=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung|Sueddeutsche]] |first=Alexander |last=Hagel\u00fcken |title=Starker Mann, was nun? |date=8 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nEconomic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels.

The creation of further leverage in EFSF with access to ECB lending would also appear to violate the terms of this article.\n\nArticles 125 and 123 were meant to create disincentives for EU member states to run excessive deficits and state debt, and prevent the [[moral hazard]] of over-spending and lending in good times.

In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require \"access to money and for banks to have a \"safe\" euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country\" which could be obtained by \"narrower [[Eurobond (eurozone)|Eurobond]] that mutualises a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time\".<ref name=\"The Economist\"/> The proposition made by [[German Council of Economic Experts]] provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, \"everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some \u20ac2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash.\" So far, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] has opposed all forms of mutualisation.<ref name=\"The Economist\"/>\n\nThe Hungarian-American business magnate [[George Soros]] warns in \"Does the Euro have a Future?\" that there is no escape from the \"gloomy scenario\" of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone's political cohesion so long as \"the authorities persist in their current course\". He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/oct/13/does-euro-have-future/?pagination=false |title=Does the Euro Have a Future? by George Soros &#124; The New York Review of Books |magazine=[[The New York Review of Books|NY Books]] |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, the European Council could then authorise the ECB to \"step into the breach\", with risks to the ECB's solvency being indemnified.\nSoros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate \"a radical change of heart\". In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes that a collapse of the European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus \"the only way\" to avert \"another Great Depression\" is the formation of a European Treasury.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\"/>\n\n===Odious debt===\n{{main|Odious debt}}\nSome protesters, commentators such as ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]'' correspondent [[Jean Quatremer]] and the [[Li\u00e8ge]]-based NGO [[Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt]] (CADTM) allege that the debt should be characterised as odious debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cadtm.org/Greece-must-deny-to-pay-an-odious |title=Greece must deny to pay an odious debt |publisher=[[Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt|CADTM]] |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref> The Greek documentary ''[[Debtocracy]]'',<ref>{{cite video |year=2011 |title=Debtocracy (international version) |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xik4kh_debtocracy-international-version_shortfilms |publisher=[[ThePressProject]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913105343/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xik4kh_debtocracy-international-version_shortfilms |archivedate=13 September 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a book of the same title and content examine whether the recent [[2008 Siemens scandal|Siemens scandal]] and uncommercial ECB loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of a large amount of the debt.<ref>{{cite book |title=Debtocracy |last1=Kitid\u0113 |first1=Katerina |last2=Vatiki\u014dt\u0113s |first2=L\u0113\u014dnidas |first3=Ar\u0113s |last3=Chatz\u0113stephanou |year=2011 |publisher=Ekdotikos organism\u014ds livan\u0113 |isbn=978-960-14-2409-5 |page=239}}</ref>\n\n===Manipulated debt and deficit statistics===\nIn 1992, members of the European Union signed an agreement known as the [[Maastricht Treaty]], under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels.

referred to as the '''eurozone crisis''' or the '''European sovereign debt crisis''') is a multi-year [[debt crisis]] that has been taking place in the [[European Union]] since the end of 2009. Several [[eurozone]] member states ([[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]] and [[Cyprus]]) were unable to repay or refinance their [[government debt]] or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other [[eurozone countries]], the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), or the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).\n\nThe eurozone crisis was caused by a [[Currency crisis|balance-of-payments crisis]] (a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that had substantial deficits and were dependent on foreign lending). The crisis was worsened by the inability of states to resort to [[devaluation]] (reductions in the value of the national currency).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Debt accumulation in some eurozone members was in part due to macroeconomic differences among eurozone member states prior to the adoption of the euro. The European Central Bank adopted an interest rate that incentivized investors in Northern eurozone members to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow (because interest rates were very low). Over time, this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South, primarily by private economic actors.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A lack of fiscal policy coordination among eurozone member states contributed to imbalanced capital flows in the eurozone.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A lack of financial regulatory centralization or harmonization among eurozone states, coupled with a lack of credible commitments to bailout banks, incentivized risky financial transactions by banks.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The detailed causes of the crisis varied from country to country. In several countries, private debts arising from a property [[Economic bubble|bubble]] were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system [[bailout]]s and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.<ref name=\"Seth W.

The ECB also contributed to solve the crisis by lowering [[interest rates]] and providing cheap loans of more than one trillion euro in order to maintain money flows between European banks. On 6 September 2012, the ECB calmed financial markets by announcing free unlimited support for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout/precautionary programme from EFSF/ESM, through some yield lowering [[Outright Monetary Transactions]] (OMT).<ref name=\"ecb\">[http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html \"Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions\"], [[European Central Bank|ECB]] Press Release, 6 September 2012</ref> Ireland and Portugal received EU-IMF bailouts In November 2010 and May 2011, respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> In March 2012, Greece received its second bailout.

Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014. Spain never officially received a bailout programme. Its rescue package from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalisation fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.\n\nThe crisis has had significant adverse economic effects and labour market effects, with unemployment rates in Greece and Spain reaching 27%,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57591731/eurozone-unemployment-at-record-high-in-may/ |title=Eurozone unemployment at record high in May |work=CBS News |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref> and was blamed for subdued economic growth, not only for the entire eurozone, but for the entire European Union. As such, it can be argued to have had a major political impact on the ruling governments in 10 out of 19 eurozone countries, contributing to power shifts in Greece, Ireland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as outside of the eurozone, in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chiara Casi |title=Bail in -la gestione delle crisi bancarie |url=https://www.academia.edu/40537955 |journal=Bail in e la Nuova Gestione delle Crisi Bancarie |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n{{Main|Causes of the European debt crisis}}\n[[File:Government debt gdp.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Total (gross) government debt around the world as a percent of [[GDP]] by IMF (2012)]]\nThe eurozone crisis resulted from the structural problem of the eurozone and a combination of complex factors. There is a consensus that the root of the eurozone crisis lay in a [[Currency crisis|balance-of-payments crisis]] (a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that were dependent on foreign lending), and that this crisis was worsened by the fact that states could not resort to [[devaluation]] (reductions in the value of the national currency to make exports more competitive in foreign markets).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Copelovitch|first=Mark|last2=Frieden|first2=Jeffry|last3=Walter|first3=Stefanie|date=2016-03-14|title=The Political Economy of the Euro Crisis|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414016633227|journal=Comparative Political Studies|language=en-US|volume=49|issue=7|pages=811\u2013840|doi=10.1177/0010414016633227|issn=0010-4140}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry|last2=Walter|first2=Stefanie|date=2017-05-11|title=Understanding the Political Economy of the Eurozone Crisis|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023101|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=20|issue=1|pages=371\u2013390|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023101|issn=1094-2939}}</ref> Other important factors include the [[Financialization|globalisation of finance]]; easy credit conditions during the 2002\u20132008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]; international trade imbalances; [[real estate bubble]]s that have since burst; the [[Great Recession]] of 2008\u20132012; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.\n\nMacroeconomic divergence among eurozone member states led to imbalanced capital flows between the member states. Prior to the adoption of the euro, Southern eurozone member states grew rapidly (with rising wages and prices) whereas Northern eurozone members grew slowly. Despite these different macroeconomic conditions, the European Central Bank could only adopt one interest rate, choosing one that meant that real interest rates in Germany were high (relative to inflation) and low in Southern eurozone member states. This incentivized investors in Germany to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow (because interest rates were very low). Over time, this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South, primarily by private economic actors.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nEurozone member states could have alleviated the imbalances in capital flows and debt accumulation in the South by coordinating national fiscal policies. Germany could have adopted more expansionary fiscal policies (to boost domestic demand and reduce the outflow of capital) and Southern eurozone member states could have adopted more restrictive fiscal policies (to curtail domestic demand and reduce borrowing from the North).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  Per the requirements of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]], governments pledged to limit their [[deficit spending]] and debt levels. However, some of the signatories, including Germany and France, failed to stay within the confines of the [[Maastricht criteria]] and turned to [[Securitization|securitising]] future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards.<ref name=\"euromoney.com\">\"[http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1000384/How-Europes-governments-have-enronized-their-debts.html How Europe's Governments have Enronized their debts],\" Mark Brown and Alex Chambers, Euromoney, September 2005</ref> This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures.<ref name=\"euromoney.com\" /> From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, [[PASOK]] government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of [[sovereign default]]s in certain [[European State|European states]] developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.<ref>Paul Belkin, Martin A. Weiss, Rebecca M. Nelson and Darek E. Mix \"The Eurozone Crisis: Overview and Issues For Congress\", Congressional Research Service Report R42377, 29 February 2012.</ref> The under-reporting was exposed through a revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit from \"6\u20138%\" of [[GDP]] (no greater than 3% of GDP was a rule of the [[Maastricht Treaty]]) to 12.7%, almost immediately after PASOK won the October 2009 Greek national elections. Large upwards revision of budget deficit forecasts due to the international financial crisis were not limited to Greece: for example, in the United States forecast for the 2009 budget deficit was raised [[2009 United States federal budget#Deficit|from $407 billion projected in the 2009 fiscal year budget, to $1.4 trillion]], while in the United Kingdom there was a final forecast more than 4 times higher than the original.<ref>{{cite news |title=Budget 2009 in figures |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8002618.stm |work=BBC News |date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Media Coverage\">{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/6655991|title= Media Coverage of the 2010 Greek Debt Crisis: Inaccuracies and Evidence of Manipulation |work= Academia.edu|date=January 2014 |accessdate= }}</ref> In Greece, the low (\"6\u20138%\") forecast was reported until very late in the year (September 2009), clearly not corresponding to the actual situation.\n\nFragmented [[financial regulation]] contributed to irresponsible lending in the years prior to the crisis. In the eurozone, each country had its own financial regulations, which allowed financial institutions to exploit gaps in monitoring and regulatory responsibility to resort to loans that were high-yield but very risky. Harmonization or centralization in financial regulations could have alleviated the problem of risky loans. Another factor that incentivized risky financial transaction was that national governments could not credibly commit not to bailout financial institutions who had undertaken risky loans, thus causing a [[moral hazard]] problem.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n==Evolution of the crisis==\n{{See also|2000s European sovereign debt crisis timeline|European debt crisis

When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a [[bailout]].<ref name=raiff>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9830fa0c-e809-11dd-b2a5-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz2u0Q66WnT |title=FT: \"Banks ask for crisis funds for eastern Europe\" 22 Jan 2009 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> At the time, the [[European Commission]] released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse.<ref name=raiff/><ref name=\"The Euro's Three Crises\">{{cite journal |title=The Euro's Three Crises |journal=Jay C.

The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and [[potential output|potential growth]]; [[Competition (companies)|competitive weakness]]; [[liquidation]] of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).<ref>P.E.

This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or [[refinance]] existing [[government debt]], particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, as in the case of Greece and Portugal.\n\nThe states that were adversely affected by the crisis faced a strong rise in interest rate spreads for government bonds as a result of investor concerns about their future debt sustainability. Four eurozone states had to be rescued by sovereign bailout programs, which were provided jointly by the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[European Commission]], with additional support at the technical level from the [[European Central Bank]]. Together these three international organisations representing the bailout creditors became nicknamed \"the [[European Troika|Troika]]\".\n\nTo fight the crisis some governments have focused on raising taxes and lowering expenditures, which contributed to social unrest and significant debate among economists, many of whom advocate greater deficits when economies are struggling. Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply, a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond [[yield spread]]s and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other [[EU member states]], most importantly Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d25573c-1ccc-11df-8d8e-00144feab49a.html |title=Gilt yields rise amid UK debt concerns |last1=Oakley |first1=David |last2=Hope |first2=Kevin |work=Financial Times |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> By the end of 2011, Germany was estimated to have made more than {{Nowrap|\u20ac9 billion}} out of the crisis as investors flocked to safer but near zero interest rate German federal government bonds (''bunds'').<ref name=\"euo_09112011\">{{cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/19/114231 |title=Germany estimated to have made \u20ac9 billion profit out of crisis |author=Valentina Pop |date=9 November 2011 |newspaper=[[EUobserver]] |accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> By July 2012 also the Netherlands, Austria, and Finland benefited from zero or negative interest rates.

The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.\n\nThe turmoil of the [[Great Recession]] lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> What was exceptional for Greece, was that the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was simultaneously coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP - as calculated after all corrections).<ref name=\"Debt Past\"/> Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name=\"Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat\">{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=teina225&language=en|title= Eurostat (Government debt data)|work= Eurostat |date= |accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref> In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]]. Finally, a role was played by controversies about Greek statistics (due to the aforementioned revisions), and, possibly, by an effect of [[Greek government-debt crisis#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was \"punished\" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making impossible for the country to finance its debt.\n\nDespite the drastic upwards revision of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit in October 2009, Greek borrowing rates initially rose rather slowly. By April 2010 it was apparent that the country was becoming unable to borrow from the markets; on 23 April 2010, the Greek government requested an initial loan of {{Nowrap|\u20ac45 billion}} from the

The negotiations were this time about how to comply with the programme requirements, to ensure activation of the payment of its last scheduled eurozone bailout tranche in December 2014, and about a potential update of its remaining bailout programme for 2015\u201316. When calculating the impact of the 2015 fiscal budget presented by the Greek government, there was a disagreement, with the calculations of the Greek government showing it fully complied with the goals of its agreed ''\"Midterm fiscal plan 2013\u201316\"'', while the Troika calculations were less optimistic and returned a not covered financing gap at \u20ac2.5bn (being required to be covered by additional austerity measures). As the Greek government insisted their calculations were more accurate than those presented by the Troika, they submitted an unchanged fiscal budget bill on 21 November, to be voted for by the parliament on 7 December. The [[Eurogroup]] was scheduled to meet and discuss the updated review of the Greek bailout programme on 8 December (to be published on the same day), and the potential adjustments to the remaining programme for 2015\u201316. There were rumours in the press that the Greek government has proposed immediately to end the previously agreed and continuing IMF bailout programme for 2015\u201316, replacing it with the transfer of \u20ac11bn unused bank recapitalization funds currently held as reserve by the [[Hellenic Financial Stability Fund]] (HFSF), along with establishment of a new precautionary Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) issued by the [[European Stability Mechanism]]. The ECCL instrument is often used as a follow-up precautionary measure, when a state has exited its sovereign bailout programme, with transfers only taking place if adverse financial/economic circumstances materialize, but with the positive effect that it help calm down financial markets as the presence of this extra backup guarantee mechanism makes the environment safer for investors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_16/11/2014_544644 |title=Analysis: Markets keep government in check |newspaper=Kathimerini |date=16 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe positive economic outlook for Greece\u2014based on the return of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across the first three quarters of 2014\u2014was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014.<ref name=\"Greece hit by a new 4th recession\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/A0704/PressReleases/A0704_SEL84_DT_QQ_01_2015_01_E_EN.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084533/http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/BUCKET/A0704/PressReleases/A0704_SEL84_DT_QQ_01_2015_01_E_EN.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 May 2015 |title=Quarterly National Accounts \u2013 1st Quarter 2015 (Flash Estimates) |publisher=ELSTAT |date=13 May 2015}}</ref> This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|snap parliamentary election]] called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a [[Coalition of the Radical Left|Syriza]]-led government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement.

A country that runs a large current account or trade deficit (i.e., importing more than it exports) must ultimately be a net importer of capital; this is a mathematical [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] called the [[balance of payments]].\nIn other words, a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. Conversely, Germany's large trade surplus (net export position) means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries to allow them to buy German goods.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/20/AR2010052005278.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Steven |last=Pearlstein |title=Forget Greece: Europe's real problem is Germany |date=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 trade deficits for Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal were estimated to be $42.96bn, $75.31bn and $35.97bn, and $25.6bn respectively, while Germany's trade surplus was $188.6bn.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html |title=CIA Factbook-Data |publisher=CIA |accessdate=23 September 2011}}</ref> A similar imbalance exists in the US, which runs a large trade deficit (net import position) and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad. [[Ben Bernanke]] warned of the risks of such imbalances in 2005, arguing that a \"savings glut\" in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits, artificially lowering interest rates and creating asset bubbles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=Ben Bernanke-U.S. Federal Reserve-The Global Savings Glut and U.S. Current Account Balance-March 2005 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html |work=The New York Times |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Revenge of the Glut |date=2 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/defending-greece-against-failed-neoliberal-policies-through-the-creation-of-sovereign-debt-for-the-productive-economy/2010/02/06 |title=P2P Foundation \" Blog Archive \" Defending Greece against failed neoliberal policies through the creation of sovereign debt for the productive economy |publisher=Blog.p2pfoundation.net |date=6 February 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nA country with a large trade surplus would generally see the value of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.<ref name=CNN01/>\n\nEither way, many of the countries involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit.<ref name=CNN01>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/09/07/247884/index.htm |publisher=CNN |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Saving Asia: It's Time To Get Radical |date=7 September 1998}}</ref> It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.\nOn the other hand, export driven countries with a large trade surplus, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption.<ref name=\"MWBOP\">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/396ff020-1ffd-11e1-8662-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1fwLi3F1I |title=Merkozy failed to save the eurozone |work=Financial Times |author=Martin Wolf |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2011|author-link=Martin Wolf }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/eu-gipfel-und-der-kampf-um-den-euro-starker-mann-was-nun-1.1229181 |newspaper=[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung|Sueddeutsche]] |first=Alexander |last=Hagel\u00fcken |title=Starker Mann, was nun? |date=8 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nEconomic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels.

The creation of further leverage in EFSF with access to ECB lending would also appear to violate the terms of this article.\n\nArticles 125 and 123 were meant to create disincentives for EU member states to run excessive deficits and state debt, and prevent the [[moral hazard]] of over-spending and lending in good times.

the limited federalisation, greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the [[fiscal integration]]. In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require \"access to money and for banks to have a \"safe\" euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country\" which could be obtained by \"narrower [[Eurobond (eurozone)|Eurobond]] that mutualises a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time\".<ref name=\"The Economist\"/> The proposition made by [[German Council of Economic Experts]] provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, \"everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some \u20ac2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years.

The majority of crimes were related to property, with a total figure of 62,072 which is approximately 2.1% of the population. The next biggest category was larceny-theft with 43,657 cases. Crimes classified as murder were relatively low with 61 cases.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== 1970 ===\nIn 1970, crimes from the previous year in each category increased drastically. The increase in population was by 555,955 people. Violent crime increased nearly 470%, rising to 7,546 cases. The biggest per case rise in crime was in property, with an increase of 96,786 cases.<ref name=\":0\" /> During this decade, although murder cases were the lowest of crimes reported under violent crimes, they had the highest percentage of arrests.

Intended for any audience, the show is inspired by the American adult animated sitcom ''[[South Park]]'' and centers around a fictional character \u2013 Noko Mashaba \u2013 an ordinary guy hailing from the calm streets of Limpopo, who occasionally ventures on extraordinary adventures to unravel mysteries and relive urban legends. On the show Mashaba always finds himself in informative, controversial and attention-grabbing situations.\n\nThe series was created in early 2013 and premiered on [[YouTube]] with one episode called \"Noko & the Famous Venda Tree\" \u2013 an episode about a mythological tree from the deep ends of [[Venda]], South Africa, which supposedly extends men's penises if planted in the right manner. The series first went viral over the internet after the release of the episode called \"Noko in High School\". The show focuses on current affairs, corruption, celebrity scandals, urban legends, history and random humor.\n\nLekganyane developed the series in 2013 after being obliged to drop out of varsity due to financial difficulties. After a few months he started his own animation company called [[Rams Comics]]. The production company that produces the adventures of Noko Mashaba and other cartoon shows such as [[The Dons show]].\n\nAn episode of the show called \"Noko vs. [[Izikhothane]]\" was rated as the most watched YouTube video of the year by [[Google]] when it revealed the most watched videos of the year in South Africa 2014. In 2015 two of the episodes of the show made their way to Google's Top 10 most viewed YouTube videos in South Africa. The show has made a number of features on a number of South African television shows. In early 2014 the show made its debut TV feature on an [[E.tv|ETV]] show called ''Against All Odds'' with Mpho Lakage, which was a profiling interview about the creator [[Jonas Lekganyane]], followed by ''[[Mzansi insider]]'', ''[[100% Youth]]'' and ''[[Sunday Live]]'' on [[SABC]]. In 2015 Noko Mashaba won the South African Film, Art, Music & Entertainment award (FAME) for best comedian. In 2016 Rams Comics along with ''[[Supa Strikas]]'' shared the comic category award of the [[YouTube]] Sub-Saharan Africa Creator YouTube awards.\n\n==Premise==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n\nThe series features characters inspired by people that exist in real life and famous [[South Africa]]n personalities. It starts with a disclaimer similar to ''[[South Park]]''{{'}}s [[tongue-in-cheek]] disclaimer: \"All characters and events in the following clip\u2014even those based on real people\u2014are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated... Poorly.\"\n\nThe show follows the intriguing life of a fictional character, '''Noko Mashaba'''. Mashaba is an audacious chap, well known for his humorous personality, created and voiced by [[Jonas Lekganyane]]. Noko was raised by his grandmother; his parents were political activist in the [[South African apartheid]] era. They disappeared with other activists into exile before their son could speak. Noko is in between jobs, in some episodes he is a Barbershop owner, some he is the president's right-hand man, but most of the time he appears as a cop.\n\nMashaba always has a sidekick with him, one of his sidekicks is '''Phusu''' \u2013 an intellectual Sangoma/wizard, who graduated at a fictional university called \"Loying University\" and obtained a degree in \"Loying Engineering\". Phusu combines the art of sorcery and science to solve the unsolvable, which makes him a remarkably exceptional [[Traditional healers of South Africa|Sangoma]].\n\nMashaba's second sidekick is '''Mthembu''' - a short and chubby man with big eyes and also Noko's mute cop partner. One of the career paths that Mashaba chooses is becoming a police detective. Mthembu has been featured on several episodes and all those episodes he has never said a single word. He only cares arresting the bad guys and going home. He doesn't speak too much, but when he does he makes sense. He has bad luck for being in the wrong place at the wrong time but luckily he has a friend \u2013 Noko Mashaba \u2013 who always comes to his rescue.\n\nMashaba was raised by his witch grandmother, who is not hard to miss because of her odd skin color and her impaired eye form. She graduated at Loying school before Phusu and obtained the same degree as him. She wears a pierced gold ring across her nose interior that illustrates her fearlessness. She also wears a black witch hat and a long maroon coat. '''Gogo Mashaba's''' age is not known but it is estimated to be in eons. She spent all her life \"eating and sleeping witchcraft\" that, over the eons she became the most feared and powerful sorcerer ever known. However, she became obsessed with testing her sorcery abilities that she ended up going to the mysterious mountain of Modimolle. She disappeared and is still missing.\n \n'''Donald Mashaba''' also known as Malome Dons (Pedi term for '''Uncle Dons''') is Noko's greedy and stubborn uncle who is also an example of many South African men that live life by the motto \u2013 mottoes such as \"you only live once\" or \"life is too short to use rubber\" etc. which is the reason why he is in a maintenance mess. Dons spends most of his time unemployed, but he does get employed, all his money goes to child support because he has 14 kids with 5 different mothers. Dons is also voiced by Lekganyane.\n\nBefore Mashaba could apply for any job he is obliged to first obtain his Matric certificate. '''Tjortan \"Slyfish\" Motaung''' is Noko Mashaba's  short tempered school teacher and the HOD of Maths & Science at the school. He holds a degree in applied mathematics and science. Mashaba and Motaung don't see eye to eye and since Motaung has a short temper & anger management issues, he sometimes gets carried away to a point of misconduct. He's made it his personal mission to get Noko suspended out of the school because he simply does not cooperate in class. Motaung is inspired by Lekganyane's late primary teacher.\n\nLastly, '''Mahlodi''' is Mashaba's high school sweetheart. She is a strong and independent woman who believes in equality between men and women in both the workplace and relationships. Mahlodi comes from a fairly wealthy family; she bails Noko out of bad situations almost every time. She uses that power to win gender equality arguments against Noko.\n\nThe series uses a few South African languages compromising Sepedi, iSiZulu, Setswana and English. It also uses small amounts of [[Fanagalo]] and an abundant mixture of street slang. Mashaba has popularized a few street slang words such as \"Abashwe\" or \"Habashwe\", which is originally known to the [[Tswana people]] and [[Pedi people]] as a sentence that means '''let them die'''. However, as a slang word, the term means '''Let's do this'''. The videos are intentionally in Jonas' home language, Sepedi.  The animated characters he grew up watching were always Western and English speaking and he feels it is important for young people to preserve their languages.\n\n==Origins and creation==\nRight after dropping out of [[University of Pretoria]] in 2013, Lekganyane began educating himself about two-dimensional animation using Google, Animation forums and YouTube tutorials. He then practiced drawing on a computer while developing his first animated visuals using [[Paint (software)|Windows Paint]] & [[Windows Movie Maker]]. A month later he had released his first animated video titled ''Night shift with Khaphela'' featuring a local soapie Generations' former actor Khaphela and a gigantic bee called Nthato. Soon after that Lekganyane created the first image of Noko Mashaba inspired by his close friend Soul Mashaba. At the time Noko Mashaba wore a green cap, with his Afro hidden inside and long brown shoes. The first episode that aired on [[YouTube]] was \"Noko & the famous Venda tree\", which was released on March 2013 then a few more episodes were released until the release of an episode called \"Noko & The spear\" - which followed the controversial issue about the [[South Africa]]n painting of the South African president [[Jacob Zuma]] called [[The Spear (painting)|''The Spear'']]. This is the episode where Noko's uncle was introduced as a crossover character. Uncle Dons later appeared in his own show called ''[[The Dons Show]]'' which premiered with a [[webisode]] called ''Jesus is back & black'' - an episode that was inspired by a true story that made the headlines about a man from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Kwa-Zulu-Natal]] who claimed to be the reincarnation of [[Jesus Christ]].\n\nIn 2014, Lekganyane released a high school themed series of episodes where Mashaba appeared as a misbehaving & reluctant high school student.\nThe first episode called ''Noko in high school'', followed by ''Noko vs Izikhothane'' reaching millions of YouTube users and mobile users across [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and other African countries. A sequel to the episode was released under the title ''Noko vs Izkikhothane Part 2'' which also went viral.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nInitial stages of the development of the each episode are conceptualizing, screenwriting, traditional hand-drawing & digital character rigging. All the scripts are written by Jonas Lekganyane with ideas inspired by his daily experiences and current affairs. He then sketches the characters on a piece of paper and scans them using a digital printer into a computer. When all the characters have been digitally rigged Lekganyane uses his cousins and friends for voice overs because when he started he could not afford to hire professional voice-over artists. Lekganyane's method of animation neglects other animation steps such as story-boarding and animatics. On completion of voice-over recording, Jonas animates the final product and lip syncs it with the voice-overs. The last stages of development include sound production, editing and subtitling. To avoid paying for copyrighted music and getting slammed with lawsuits, Lekganyane also produces the music and sound effects for the series.\n\n==Awards==\n{| class= \"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

Intended for any audience, the show is inspired by the American adult animated sitcom ''[[South Park]]'' and centers around a fictional character \u2013 Noko Mashaba \u2013 an ordinary guy hailing from the calm streets of Limpopo, who occasionally ventures on extraordinary adventures to unravel mysteries and relive urban legends. On the show Mashaba always finds himself in informative, controversial and attention-grabbing situations.\n\nThe series was created in early 2013 and premiered on [[YouTube]] with one episode called \"Noko & the Famous Venda Tree\" \u2013 an episode about a mythological tree from the deep ends of [[Venda]], South Africa, which supposedly extends men's penises if planted in the right manner. The series first went viral over the internet after the release of the episode called \"Noko in High School\". The show focuses on current affairs, corruption, celebrity scandals, urban legends, history and random humor.\n\nLekganyane developed the series in 2013 after being obliged to drop out of varsity due to financial difficulties. After a few months he started his own animation company called [[Rams Comics]]. The production company that produces the adventures of Noko Mashaba and other cartoon shows such as [[The Dons show]].\n\nAn episode of the show called \"Noko vs. Izikhothane\" was rated as the most watched YouTube video of the year by [[Google]] when it revealed the most watched videos of the year in South Africa 2014. In 2015 two of the episodes of the show made their way to Google's Top 10 most viewed YouTube videos in South Africa. The show has made a number of features on a number of South African television shows. In early 2014 the show made its debut TV feature on an [[E.tv|ETV]] show called ''Against All Odds'' with Mpho Lakage, which was a profiling interview about the creator [[Jonas Lekganyane]], followed by ''[[Mzansi insider]]'', ''[[100% Youth]]'' and ''[[Sunday Live]]'' on [[SABC]]. In 2015 Noko Mashaba won the South African Film, Art, Music & Entertainment award (FAME) for best comedian. In 2016 Rams Comics along with ''[[Supa Strikas]]'' shared the comic category award of the [[YouTube]] Sub-Saharan Africa Creator YouTube awards.\n\n==Premise==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n\nThe series features characters inspired by people that exist in real life and famous [[South Africa]]n personalities. It starts with a disclaimer similar to ''[[South Park]]''{{'}}s [[tongue-in-cheek]] disclaimer: \"All characters and events in the following clip\u2014even those based on real people\u2014are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated... Poorly.\"\n\nThe show follows the intriguing life of a fictional character, '''Noko Mashaba'''. Mashaba is an audacious chap, well known for his humorous personality, created and voiced by [[Jonas Lekganyane]]. Noko was raised by his grandmother; his parents were political activist in the [[South African apartheid]] era. They disappeared with other activists into exile before their son could speak. Noko is in between jobs, in some episodes he is a Barbershop owner, some he is the president's right-hand man, but most of the time he appears as a cop.\n\nMashaba always has a sidekick with him, one of his sidekicks is '''Phusu''' \u2013 an intellectual Sangoma/wizard, who graduated at a fictional university called \"Loying University\" and obtained a degree in \"Loying Engineering\". Phusu combines the art of sorcery and science to solve the unsolvable, which makes him a remarkably exceptional [[Traditional healers of South Africa|Sangoma]].\n\nMashaba's second sidekick is '''Mthembu''' - a short and chubby man with big eyes and also Noko's mute cop partner. One of the career paths that Mashaba chooses is becoming a police detective. Mthembu has been featured on several episodes and all those episodes he has never said a single word. He only cares arresting the bad guys and going home. He doesn't speak too much, but when he does he makes sense. He has bad luck for being in the wrong place at the wrong time but luckily he has a friend \u2013 Noko Mashaba \u2013 who always comes to his rescue.\n\nMashaba was raised by his witch grandmother, who is not hard to miss because of her odd skin color and her impaired eye form. She graduated at Loying school before Phusu and obtained the same degree as him. She wears a pierced gold ring across her nose interior that illustrates her fearlessness. She also wears a black witch hat and a long maroon coat. '''Gogo Mashaba's''' age is not known but it is estimated to be in eons. She spent all her life \"eating and sleeping witchcraft\" that, over the eons she became the most feared and powerful sorcerer ever known. However, she became obsessed with testing her sorcery abilities that she ended up going to the mysterious mountain of Modimolle. She disappeared and is still missing.\n \n'''Donald Mashaba''' also known as Malome Dons (Pedi term for '''Uncle Dons''') is Noko's greedy and stubborn uncle who is also an example of many South African men that live life by the motto \u2013 mottoes such as \"you only live once\" or \"life is too short to use rubber\" etc. which is the reason why he is in a maintenance mess. Dons spends most of his time unemployed, but he does get employed, all his money goes to child support because he has 14 kids with 5 different mothers. Dons is also voiced by Lekganyane.\n\nBefore Mashaba could apply for any job he is obliged to first obtain his Matric certificate. '''Tjortan \"Slyfish\" Motaung''' is Noko Mashaba's  short tempered school teacher and the HOD of Maths & Science at the school. He holds a degree in applied mathematics and science. Mashaba and Motaung don't see eye to eye and since Motaung has a short temper & anger management issues, he sometimes gets carried away to a point of misconduct. He's made it his personal mission to get Noko suspended out of the school because he simply does not cooperate in class. Motaung is inspired by Lekganyane's late primary teacher.\n\nLastly, '''Mahlodi''' is Mashaba's high school sweetheart. She is a strong and independent woman who believes in equality between men and women in both the workplace and relationships. Mahlodi comes from a fairly wealthy family; she bails Noko out of bad situations almost every time. She uses that power to win gender equality arguments against Noko.\n\nThe series uses a few South African languages compromising Sepedi, iSiZulu, Setswana and English. It also uses small amounts of [[Fanagalo]] and an abundant mixture of street slang. Mashaba has popularized a few street slang words such as \"Abashwe\" or \"Habashwe\", which is originally known to the [[Tswana people]] and [[Pedi people]] as a sentence that means '''let them die'''. However, as a slang word, the term means '''Let's do this'''. The videos are intentionally in Jonas' home language, Sepedi.  The animated characters he grew up watching were always Western and English speaking and he feels it is important for young people to preserve their languages.\n\n==Origins and creation==\nRight after dropping out of [[University of Pretoria]] in 2013, Lekganyane began educating himself about two-dimensional animation using Google, Animation forums and YouTube tutorials. He then practiced drawing on a computer while developing his first animated visuals using [[Paint (software)|Windows Paint]] & [[Windows Movie Maker]]. A month later he had released his first animated video titled ''Night shift with Khaphela'' featuring a local soapie Generations' former actor Khaphela and a gigantic bee called Nthato. Soon after that Lekganyane created the first image of Noko Mashaba inspired by his close friend Soul Mashaba. At the time Noko Mashaba wore a green cap, with his Afro hidden inside and long brown shoes. The first episode that aired on [[YouTube]] was \"Noko & the famous Venda tree\", which was released on March 2013 then a few more episodes were released until the release of an episode called \"Noko & The spear\" - which followed the controversial issue about the [[South Africa]]n painting of the South African president [[Jacob Zuma]] called [[The Spear (painting)|''The Spear'']]. This is the episode where Noko's uncle was introduced as a crossover character. Uncle Dons later appeared in his own show called ''[[The Dons Show]]'' which premiered with a [[webisode]] called ''Jesus is back & black'' - an episode that was inspired by a true story that made the headlines about a man from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Kwa-Zulu-Natal]] who claimed to be the reincarnation of [[Jesus Christ]].\n\nIn 2014, Lekganyane released a high school themed series of episodes where Mashaba appeared as a misbehaving & reluctant high school student.\nThe first episode called ''Noko in high school'', followed by ''Noko vs Izikhothane'' reaching millions of YouTube users and mobile users across [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and other African countries. A sequel to the episode was released under the title ''Noko vs Izkikhothane Part 2'' which also went viral.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nInitial stages of the development of the each episode are conceptualizing, screenwriting, traditional hand-drawing & digital character rigging. All the scripts are written by Jonas Lekganyane with ideas inspired by his daily experiences and current affairs. He then sketches the characters on a piece of paper and scans them using a digital printer into a computer. When all the characters have been digitally rigged Lekganyane uses his cousins and friends for voice overs because when he started he could not afford to hire professional voice-over artists. Lekganyane's method of animation neglects other animation steps such as story-boarding and animatics. On completion of voice-over recording, Jonas animates the final product and lip syncs it with the voice-overs. The last stages of development include sound production, editing and subtitling. To avoid paying for copyrighted music and getting slammed with lawsuits, Lekganyane also produces the music and sound effects for the series.\n\n==Awards==\n{| class= \"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

As such, she brought together leaders from all different fields who are either working in or committed to building that relationship.

Since the opening of its historic site in 1992, the museum has continued to fulfill its mission through historical exhibitions, and through partnerships with other communities and museums.  It has been at the forefront of preserving, researching and educating about the internment experience during [[World War II]], as well as related issues such as Japanese American military service in World War II, redress, and broader civil rights.

She saw the importance of connecting Japanese American communities and younger Nikkei generations to the land of their ancestry as an important way to strengthen U.S.-Japan relations.  Having led U.S. delegations to Japan under the Japanese Government's Japanese American Leadership Delegation for several years, she recognized the untapped potential within the Japanese American community to actively support people-to-people connections that were the foundation of the bilateral relationship.  She saw that although many Japanese Americans had been addressing U.S.-Japan relations in their various professions, the time had come to create an organization of leaders who are dedicated to working on U.S.-Japan relations.  As such, she brought together leaders from all different fields who are either working in or committed to building that relationship. There are many Japanese Americans in very high positions in various sectors.  The Council's role is to connect them with each other, with their counterparts in Japan, and with other diverse leaders with the same mission and vision.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/people/e00027/|title=The Potential of \"Tomodachi\" to Connect People|last=Joji|first=Harano|date=October 12, 2012|website=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon.com|access-date=December 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Council has grown in size and expanded its activities to include diverse participants, and signature programs such as the Japanese American Leadership Delegation, the Asian American Leadership Delegation, the Emerging Leaders Program, and well-attended Annual Conferences that gather government, business, and civil society leaders from both countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/usjc/pages/616/attachments/original/1461096204/USJC_2015_Annual_Report_-_English_-_FINAL_(small).pdf?1461096204|title=USJC 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=January 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince 2011, the U.S.-Japan Council has administered the TOMODACHI Initiative in partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.

GMA Network is the flagship property of publicly traded [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Its first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961. GMA Network (formerly known as '''RBS TV Channel 7''', '''GMA Radio-Television Arts''' and '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network''') is commonly referred to as the \"Kapuso Network\" in reference to the outline of the company's logo. It has also been called the \"Christian Network\", which refers to the apparent programming during the tenure of the new management, which took over in 1974. It is headquartered in the [[GMA Network Center]] in [[Quezon City]] and its transmitter, [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]], is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com|title=GMANetwork.com - Online home of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com}}</ref>\n\nThe original meaning of the GMA acronym was '''[[Greater Manila Area]]''', referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into '''Global Media Arts'''. GMA's flagship [[television station]] is [[DZBB-TV]] which carries VHF Channel 7 (Analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 15 (Digital broadcast). The network has 4 originating stations and 48 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[GMA Pinoy TV]], [[GMA Life TV]] and [[GMA News TV|GMA News TV International]].\n\n==History==\n===1950s and 1960s===\nThe origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]],<ref name=Origins>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/about GMA Network Corporate Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816053420/http://www.gmanetwork.com/about |date=August 16, 2008 }}, GMANetwork.com</ref> which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in [[Manila]] on June 14, 1950 and owned by [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]], an American war correspondent.<ref name=\"ABC\">''GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History'', Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network.</ref> Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started RBS TV Channel 7 (under the call letters [[DZBB-TV]]) on October 29, 1961, becoming the Philippines' fifth terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the [[United States]] and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like ''Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club'', a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; ''Dance Time with Chito''; and various news programs like ''[[News at Seven]]''. In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, [[DYSS-TV|DYSS Channel 7]] (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS).<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nOn September 21, 1972, then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[Martial Law|martial law]] by the virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081|Proclamation 1081]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906446,00.html|title=THE PHILIPPINES: Marcos' Martial Law|date=October 2, 1972|work=TIME.com}}</ref> Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down [[7th Congress of the Philippines|the Congress]] and media establishments including RBS. In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca\u00f1ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974; and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for [[Greater Manila Area]], the station's initial coverage area); though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover ensued.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about/overview|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|date=|website=|publisher=GMA Network, Inc.|access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"PinoyTV\">''What's the story, Pinoy TV?'', Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network.</ref><ref name=\"Gozon\">{{cite news|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/12/05/henry-gozon-s-near-death-experience|title=Henry Gozon\u2019s near-death experience|author=''Tony Lopez''|newspaper=The Standard|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref> The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a [[circle 7 logo]] in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.\n\nAfter that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.<ref name=\"Gozon\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nWhen [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.<ref name=\"ABC\"/><ref name=\"PinoyTV\"/> However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] via ''[[Viewpoint (Philippine TV series)|Viewpoint]]'' in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nWhen democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as ''GMA StereoVision''), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''[[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]]'' located along Tandang Sora, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m6EVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6031%2C1257960 Pres.

A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,\" granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, \"to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services\" for a period of 25 years.\n\nUnder Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]]. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of [[South America]] through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' and ''[[Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!]]'' began broadcasting on GMA after [[TAPE Inc.]] refused [[ABS-CBN]]'s proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel subsidiary, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them was [[Bubble Gang]] one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Karen Davila]].

In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan ''Where You Belong'', and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the '''Rainbow Network,''' succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the '''Kapuso Network'''.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/> After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as '''''Kapuso''''') is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.\n\n===Slogans===\n'''''Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino''''' ('''''One in Heart with Every Filipino''''')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network.

GMA Network is the flagship property of publicly traded [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Its first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961. GMA Network (formerly known as '''RBS TV Channel 7''', '''GMA Radio-Television Arts''' and '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network''') is commonly referred to as the \"Kapuso Network\" in reference to the outline of the company's logo. It has also been called the \"Christian Network\", which refers to the apparent programming during the tenure of the new management, which took over in 1974. It is headquartered in the [[GMA Network Center]] in [[Quezon City]] and its transmitter, [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]], is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com|title=GMANetwork.com - Online home of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com}}</ref>\n\nThe original meaning of the GMA acronym was '''[[Greater Manila Area]]''', referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into '''Global Media Arts'''. GMA's flagship [[television station]] is [[DZBB-TV]] which carries VHF Channel 7 (Analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 15 (Digital broadcast). The network has 4 originating stations and 48 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[GMA Pinoy TV]], [[GMA Life TV]] and [[GMA News TV|GMA News TV International]].\n\n==History==\n===1950s and 1960s===\nThe origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]],<ref name=Origins>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/about GMA Network Corporate Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816053420/http://www.gmanetwork.com/about |date=August 16, 2008 }}, GMANetwork.com</ref> which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in [[Manila]] on June 14, 1950 and owned by [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]], an American war correspondent.<ref name=\"ABC\">''GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History'', Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network.</ref> Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started RBS TV Channel 7 (under the call letters [[DZBB-TV]]) on October 29, 1961, becoming the Philippines' fifth terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the [[United States]] and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like ''Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club'', a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; ''Dance Time with Chito''; and various news programs like ''[[News at Seven]]''. In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, [[DYSS-TV|DYSS Channel 7]] (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS).<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nOn September 21, 1972, then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[Martial Law|martial law]] by the virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081|Proclamation 1081]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906446,00.html|title=THE PHILIPPINES: Marcos' Martial Law|date=October 2, 1972|work=TIME.com}}</ref> Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down [[7th Congress of the Philippines|the Congress]] and media establishments including RBS. In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca\u00f1ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974; and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for [[Greater Manila Area]], the station's initial coverage area); though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover ensued.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about/overview|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|date=|website=|publisher=GMA Network, Inc.|access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"PinoyTV\">''What's the story, Pinoy TV?'', Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network.</ref><ref name=\"Gozon\">{{cite news|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/12/05/henry-gozon-s-near-death-experience|title=Henry Gozon\u2019s near-death experience|author=''Tony Lopez''|newspaper=The Standard|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref> The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a [[circle 7 logo]] in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.\n\nAfter that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.<ref name=\"Gozon\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nWhen [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.<ref name=\"ABC\"/><ref name=\"PinoyTV\"/> However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] via ''[[Viewpoint (Philippine TV series)|Viewpoint]]'' in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nWhen democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as ''GMA StereoVision''), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''[[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]]'' located along Tandang Sora, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m6EVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6031%2C1257960 Pres.

A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,\" granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, \"to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services\" for a period of 25 years.\n\nUnder Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]]. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of [[South America]] through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' and ''[[Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!]]'' began broadcasting on GMA after [[TAPE Inc.]] refused [[ABS-CBN]]'s proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel subsidiary, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them was [[Bubble Gang]] one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Karen Davila]]. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia.\n\nIn 1995, GMA founded its film production company, ''Cinemax Studios'' (later renamed to [[GMA Films]] in 1998) with the film ''[[Run Barbi Run]]''. Its film ''[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal (film)|Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'' released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations.\n\nOn May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''. [[GoBingo]], initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by [[Arnell Ignacio]], with Maricar de Mesa as the first ''GobiGirl''. In 1998, GMA pioneered on [[Filipino language]] late night news broadcast with the news program ''[[GMA Network News]]'' as the first Filipino-language late-night television newscast after it was debuted six years ago as an [[English-language]] late-night newscast, as English newscasts were started since the introduction of television in the country in 1953. As the newscast fasten to higher than its English newscasts, all networks start to follow including [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] in 1998, [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] in 1999, [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]] in 2000, NBN (now [[People's Television Network|PTV]]) in 2001 and ABC (now [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]]) in 2004.\n\nGMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a [[Peabody Award]] for Investigative Reporting in 1999.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/investigative-reporting 59th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2000.</ref> Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the [[Channel V]] franchise called [[Channel V Philippines]]. Channel V the Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and [[PLDT]] (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate [[MTV Philippines]] through their subsidiary, the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for ''[[2000 Today]]'', the most-successful international television special that commemorated the dawn of the new [[millennium]]. At the turn of the millennium, GMA was the only local network to go on 24-hour, non-stop broadcasting (However, in 2001, the network reduced back to regular broadcast hours for its regular transmitter maintenance due to NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations). At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO (he would later be assumed office as a member of the board of directors of [[San Miguel Corporation]] in 2002) and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Duavit's son Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of the chief operating officer.\n\n===2000s===\nOn October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's noontime show ''[[SOP (TV program)|SOP]]'', GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow-colored heart-shaped logo, the Kapuso, represented by a new slogan \"Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay\" (\"One in Heart With the [[Filipinos|Filipino]] family, In Whatever Colors of Life\"), and a [[Century Gothic]] Bold font for the letters. The \"Kapuso\" theme song is sung by [[Regine Velasquez]].\n[[File:Gmajfaa.JPG|thumb|left|200px|View of GMA Network Center from [[Kamuning MRT Station]]]]\nIn 2003, ''Saksi'' won the New York Television Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so.

Gozon, Gilberto Duavit, Jr., and Joel Marcelo Jimenez.\n\n==Branding==\n\n===Network identity===\nOn October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as [[DZBB-TV|RBS TV Channel 7]]. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification.\n\n:*'''RBS TV Channel 7 (1961\u20131974)''' \u2013 From the success of its amplitude modulation band radio [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]], [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]] launches its first television and the Philippines third terrestrial channel, RBS TV Channel 7.\n:* '''GMA Radio-Television Arts (1974\u20131992)''' \u2013 To ascertain its presence in its coverage area, the Greater Manila Area, RBS changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts after the takeover by the new management.\n:* '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network (Rainbow Network, 1992\u20131995)''' \u2013 When the network launched its satellite to widen its coverage area, GMA again rebranded its network identity on April 26, 1992.\n:* '''GMA Network (Rainbow Network, 1995\u20132002)''' \u2013 In preparation for the 45th year of responsible broadcasting, GMA Rainbow Satellite changed to GMA Network.\n:* '''GMA Network (Kapuso Network, 2002\u2013present)''' \u2013 On October 27, 2002, GMA Network unveiled its new identity and catchphrase. In an effort to localize and transform its image into a more intrinsic Filipino network, GMA Network engaged in a rebranding course.\n\n===Logos===\nGMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the [[Circle 7 logo]] for its Metro Manila and Cebu stations, which is also expended by several networks around the world (predominately the O&O stations of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States). In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan ''Where You Belong'', and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the '''Rainbow Network,''' succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the '''Kapuso Network'''.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/> After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as '''''Kapuso''''') is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.\n\n===Slogans===\n'''''Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino''''' ('''''One in Heart with Every Filipino''''')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network.
