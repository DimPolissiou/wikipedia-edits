With eminent examples of realism, orientalism, impressionism, and post-impressionism, the collection offers a unique overview of French and American art in the 19th century. Highlights of the collection include: ''Juno'' (ca. 1665-1668) by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Education of the Virgin'' (1748-1752) by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], ''El Pelele'' (ca. 1791) by [[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Salome Dancing before Herod]]'' (1876) by [[Gustave Moreau]], ''Dr. Pozzi at Home'' (1881) by [[John Singer Sargent]], ''Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin'' (1889) by [[Paul Gauguin]], and ''Hospital at Saint-Remy'' (1889) by [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\n===Daumier and Contemporaries Collection===\n[[File:Hospital at Saint Remy.jpg|thumb|Vincent van Gogh.

Highlights of the collection include: ''Juno'' (ca. 1665-1668) by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Education of the Virgin'' (1748-1752) by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], ''El Pelele'' (ca. 1791) by [[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Salome Dancing before Herod]]'' (1876) by [[Gustave Moreau]], ''Dr. Pozzi at Home'' (1881) by [[John Singer Sargent]], ''Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin'' (1889) by [[Paul Gauguin]], and ''Hospital at Saint-Remy'' (1889) by [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\n===Daumier and Contemporaries Collection===\n[[File:Hospital at Saint Remy.jpg|thumb|Vincent van Gogh.

She was the U.S. Navy's [[USS Thresher (SS-200)|second submarine]] to be named after the [[thresher shark]].\n\nOn 10 April 1963, ''Thresher'' sank during deep-diving tests about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} east of Boston, Massachusetts, killing all 129 crew and shipyard personnel aboard.

The first [[List of sunken nuclear submarines|nuclear submarine lost at sea]], ''Thresher'' was also the third of four submarine losses that killed over 100 aboard; the others being the [[USS Argonaut (SM-1)|Argonaut]], lost with 102 aboard in World War II, the Surcouf, and the ''[[Kursk submarine disaster|Kursk]]'', which sank with 118 aboard in 2000.\n\n==Significance of design and loss==\nCreated to find and destroy [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines, ''Thresher'' was the fastest and quietest submarine of the day, matching the smaller, contemporary {{sclass-|Skipjack|submarine|4}}. She also had the most advanced weapons system, including launchers for the U.S. Navy's newest [[anti-submarine missile]], the [[UUM-44 SUBROC|SUBROC]], as well as passive and active sonar that could detect vessels at unprecedented range. Shortly after her loss, the [[COMSUBLANT#Officers serving as COMSUBLANT|Commander of Submarine Force Atlantic]] wrote in the March 1964 issue of the [[U.S. Naval Institute]]'s monthly journal ''Proceedings'' that \"the Navy had depended upon this performance to the extent that it had asked for and received authority to build 14 of these ships, as well as an additional 11 submarines with very much the same characteristics. This was the first time since World War II that we had considered our design sufficiently advanced to embark upon construction of a large class of general-purpose attack submarines.\"{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFollowing Navy tradition, this class of subs was originally named ''Thresher'' after the lead boat.  When ''Thresher'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 16 April 1963, the class name was changed to that of the second boat, {{USS|Permit|SSN-594|2}}, and ''Thresher'' is now officially referred to as a [[Permit-class submarine|''Permit''-class submarine]]. Having been \"lost at sea\", ''Thresher'' was not decommissioned by the U.S. Navy and remains on \"Eternal Patrol\".{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:USS Thresher (SSN-593) bow.jpg|thumb|left|''Thresher'' at sea on 24 July 1961]]\nThe contract to build ''Thresher'' was awarded to [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] on 15 January 1958, and her [[keel]] was laid on 28 May 1958. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 July 1960, was sponsored by Mrs. Mary B.

Axene commanding.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n''Thresher'' conducted lengthy sea trials in the western Atlantic and [[Caribbean Sea]] areas in 1961\u20131962. These tests allowed a thorough evaluation of her many new and complex technological features and weapons. She took part in Nuclear Submarine Exercise (NUSUBEX) 3\u201361 off the northeastern coast of the United States from 18\u201324 September 1961.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 18 October 1961, ''Thresher,'' in company with the diesel-electric submarine {{USS|Cavalla|SS-244|2}}, headed south on a 3-week test and training cruise to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], arriving 2 November. Following customary procedure while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no shore power connection was available in San Juan, the ship's backup [[diesel generator]] was used to carry the [[Hotel electric power|\"hotel\" electrical loads]]. Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load was transferred to the ship's battery.  As most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, lighting and air conditioning were shut down. Without air conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching {{convert|60|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} after about 10 hours. The crew attempted to repair the diesel generator (four men would receive [[Commendation Medal|Navy commendation medals]] for their work that night). After it became apparent that the generator could not be fixed before the battery was depleted, the crew tried to restart the reactor, but the remaining battery charge was insufficient. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. The crew eventually borrowed cables from another ship in the harbor and connected them to the adjacent ''Cavalla'', which started her diesels and provided enough power to allow ''Thresher'' to restart her reactor.<ref>Polmar, pp. 13\u201317</ref>\n\n''Thresher'' conducted further trials and fired test [[torpedo]]es before returning to Portsmouth on 29 November 1961. The boat remained in port through the end of the year, and spent the first two months of 1962 evaluating her [[sonar]] and SUBROC systems. In March, she participated in NUSUBEX 2\u201362 (an exercise designed to improve the tactical capabilities of nuclear submarines) and in [[anti-submarine warfare]] training with Task Group ALPHA.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOff [[Charleston, South Carolina]], ''Thresher'' undertook operations supporting development of the [[UUM-44 SUBROC|SUBROC anti-submarine missile]].  She returned briefly to [[New England]] waters, after which she proceeded to Florida for more SUBROC tests. While moored at [[Port Canaveral, Florida]], the submarine was accidentally struck by a tug, which damaged one of her [[ballast tanks]]. After repairs at [[Groton, Connecticut]], by the [[Electric Boat]] Company, ''Thresher'' went south for more tests and trials off [[Key West, Florida]], then returned northward. The submarine entered Portsmouth Shipyard on 16 July 1962 to begin a scheduled 6-month post-shakedown availability to examine systems and make repairs and corrections as necessary. As is typical with a first-of-class boat, the work took longer than expected, lasting nearly 9 months. The ship was finally recertified and undocked on 8 April 1963.<ref>[http://www.navalhistory.org/2013/04/01/uss-thresher-ssn-593-3-august-1961-10-april-1963 \"USS ''Thresher''\"], article by Vice Admiral E.W.

One aspect of the search conducted that summer by ''Mizar'' involved the use of highly sensitive [[proton magnetometer]]s furnished by the Instrument Division of [[Varian Associates]] in Palo Alto, and shipped aboard ''Mizar'' before her departure from NRL in Washington. The magnetometers were used in conjunction with underwater video cameras and suspended on the same electrical line used to tow the video cameras themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/numerical-list-of-images/nhhc-series/nh-series/NH-97000/NH-97555.html|title=Loss of USS Thresher|website=History.navy.mil}}</ref>\n\n''Trieste II'' was commanded by Lieutenant John B.

Earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints,<ref>[http://www.navsea.navy.mil/NewsView.aspx?nw=NewsWires&id=224 50 Years of Steely Purpose-USS Thresher Remembered] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130626170831/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/NewsView.aspx?nw=NewsWires&id=224 |date=26 June 2013 }}.

High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have shorted out one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown (\"[[scram]]\") of the reactor, which in turn caused loss of propulsion. The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine's high-pressure air flasks, moisture which froze and plugged the flasks' flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dock-side tests on ''Thresher''{{'}}s sister sub, {{USS|Tinosa|SSN-606|2}}. During a test to simulate blowing ballast at or near [[test depth]], ice formed on strainers installed in valves; the flow of air lasted only a few seconds.<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08593b.htm Thresher (SSN-593)  Loss & Inquiry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031061419/http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/08593b.htm |date=31 October 2013 }}.

Such flooding would have been a significant sonic event, and no evidence of that can be found in the recorded data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iusscaa.org/articles/brucerule/letter_to_the_deputy_cno.htm|title=Information and Security Issues Associated with the Loss of the USS Thresher|website=Iusscaa.org}}</ref>\n\nSubmarines typically rely on speed and deck angle ([[angle of attack]]) rather than deballasting to surface; they are propelled at an angle towards the surface. Ballast tanks were almost never blown at depth, and doing so could cause the submarine to rocket to the surface out of control. Normal procedure was to drive the submarine to [[periscope]] depth, raise the periscope to verify the area was clear, then blow the tanks and surface the submarine.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAt the time, reactor-plant operating procedures did not allow for a rapid reactor restart following a scram, or even the ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to propel the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main steam system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. ''Thresher''{{'}}s reactor control officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accident&nbsp;\u2013 he had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from [[Naval Nuclear Power School|nuclear power school]], probably followed standard operating procedures and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though ''Thresher'' was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to \"answer bells\" and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. [[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Rickover]] later changed the procedure, creating the \"Fast Recovery Startup\" procedure. The Fast Recovery Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn a dockside simulation of flooding in the engine room, held before ''Thresher'' sailed, it took the watch in charge 20 minutes to isolate a simulated leak in the auxiliary seawater system. At test depth with the reactor shut down, ''Thresher'' would not have had 20 minutes to recover. Even after isolating a short-circuit in the reactor controls, it would have taken nearly 10 minutes to restart the plant.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n''Thresher'' likely [[implosion (mechanical process)|imploded]] at a depth of {{convert|1300|-|2000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy has periodically monitored the environmental conditions of the site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. Naval nuclear-powered craft. These reports provide specifics on the environmental sampling of [[sediment]], water, and marine life which was done to ascertain whether ''Thresher''{{'}}s nuclear reactor has had a significant effect on the deep ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting deep-sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm that there has been no significant effect on the environment. Nuclear fuel in the submarine remains intact.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDeclassified information in December 2018 showed that [[United_States_Navy_Reserve|USNR]] Commander (Dr.) [[Robert Ballard]], the oceanographer credited with locating the wreck of {{RMS|Titanic}}, was sent by the Navy on a mission under cover of the search for ''Titanic'' to map and collect visual data on ''Thresher'' and {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|2}} wrecks.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/25/60minutes/main5773673.shtml The Great Explorer] ''[[60 Minutes]]''; aired 29 November 2009</ref>  Ballard had approached the Navy in 1982 for funding to find ''Titanic'' with his new deep-diving robot submersible.

The boat is descending in slow circles, and announces to ''Skylark'' she is turning to \"Corpen [course] 090.\" At this point, transmission quality from ''Thresher'' begins to noticeably degrade, possibly as a result of [[thermocline]]s.\n|-\n| 09:09 || As an unproven hypothesis that is disputed by acoustic data, the Navy's official investigation stated the likelihood of a brazed pipe-joint rupturing in the engine room. The crew would have attempted to stop the leak; at the same time, the engine room would be filling with a cloud of mist. Under the circumstances, Commander Harvey's likely decision would have been to order full speed, full rise on the fairwater planes, and blowing main ballast in order to surface. The pressurized air rapidly expanding in the pipes [[Joule-Thomson effect|cools down]], condensing moisture and depositing it on intended-as temporary strainers installed in the system to protect the moving parts of the valves during new-construction (should have been removed prior to sea trials)<ref>https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2018/july/declassify-thresher-data</ref>; in only a few seconds the moisture freezes, clogging the strainers and blocking the air flow, halting the effort to blow ballast. Water leaking from the broken pipe most likely causes short circuits leading to an automatic [[scram|shutdown]] of the ship's reactor, causing a loss of propulsion. The logical action at this point would have been for Harvey to order propulsion shifted to a battery-powered backup system. As soon as the flooding was contained, the engine room crew would have begun to restart the reactor, an operation that would be expected to take at least 7&nbsp;minutes.\n|-\n| 09:12 || ''Skylark'' pages ''Thresher'' on the underwater telephone: \"Gertrude [[underwater telephone]] check, K [over].\" With no immediate response (although ''Skylark'' is still unaware of the conditions aboard ''Thresher''), the signal \"K\" is repeated twice.\n|-\n| 09:13 || Harvey reports status via underwater telephone. The transmission is garbled, though some words are recognizable: \"[We are] experiencing minor difficulty, have positive up-angle, attempting to blow.\" The submarine, as a hypothesis, growing heavier from water flooding the engine room, continues its descent, probably tail-first. Another attempt to empty the ballast tanks is performed, again failing due to the formation of ice. Officers on ''Skylark'' could hear the hiss of compressed air over the loudspeaker at this point.\n|-\n| 09:14 || ''Skylark'' acknowledges with a brisk, \"Roger, out,\" awaiting further updates from the SSN. A follow-up message, \"No contacts in area,\" is sent to reassure ''Thresher'' she can surface quickly, without fear of collision, if required.\n|-\n| 09:15 || ''Skylark'' queries ''Thresher'' about her intentions: \"My course 270 degrees.

Hecker initiated \"Event SUBMISS [loss of a submarine]\" procedures at 11:21, and continued to repeatedly hail ''Thresher'' until after 17:00.\n|}\n\nDuring the 1963 inquiry, Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]] stated:\n\n<blockquote>I believe the loss of the Thresher should not be viewed solely as the result of failure of a specific braze, weld, system or component, but rather should be considered a consequence of the philosophy of design, construction and inspection that has been permitted in our naval shipbuilding programs. I think it is important that we re-evaluate our present practices where, in the desire to make advancements, we may have forsaken the fundamentals of good engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2013/vanderbilt-ties-to-%E2%80%98worst-submarine-tragedy%E2%80%99-50-years-ago/ |title=Vanderbilt ties to 'worst submarine tragedy' 50 years ago |publisher=School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University |date=2013 |accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Alternative theory of the sinking: electrical failure==\nOn 8 April 2013, Bruce Rule, an acoustic data expert, published his own analysis of the data collected by USS ''Skylark'' and Atlantic [[SOSUS]] arrays in a paper<ref>[http://www.designed4submariners.com/uploads/Docs_Thresher_and_Scorpion_Loss.pdf \"What Sank The Thresher\"], Bruce Rule, 10 April 2013</ref> in the ''Navy Times''.<ref>[http://www.navytimes.com/article/20130404/NEWS/304040021/50-years-later-look-what-really-sank-Thresher \"50 years later, a look at what really sank the ''Thresher''\"], Bruce Rule and [[Norman Polmar]], 4 April 2013 (''Navy Times'' link)</ref><ref name=\"navtimespdf\">[http://www.designed4submariners.com/uploads/Thresher_Report.pdf \"What Sank The Thresher\"], Bruce Rule and [[Norman Polmar]], 8 April 2013</ref> Rule based his analysis on SOSUS data that was highly classified in 1963 and was not discussed in open session of the Court of Inquiry and was not revealed at the congressional hearings.<ref name=\"navtimespdf\"/>  A retired Navy captain and former commanding officer of the same class of submarine as ''Thresher'', citing Rule's findings, has called for the U.S. government to declassify the data associated with the boat's sinking, and presented an alternative disaster sequence based upon the acoustic data.<ref>https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2018/july/declassify-thresher-data</ref><ref>https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2019/07/16/retired-navy-captain-believes-time-now-release-thresher-records/1738878001/</ref>\n\nRule concluded that the primary cause of the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11&nbsp;a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. ''Thresher'' could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so she sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that ''Thresher'' was intact until she imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of ''Skylark'' did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and ''Skylark'' was able to communicate with ''Thresher'', despite the fact that, at test depth, even a small leak would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of ''Thresher'' testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a \"minor problem\".<ref name=\"navtimespdf\"/>\n\nRule interprets the communication \"900\" from ''Thresher'' at 9:17&nbsp;a.m. as a reference to test depth, signifying that ''Thresher'' was {{convert|900|ft|order=flip}} below her test depth of {{convert|1,300|ft|order=flip}}, or {{convert|2,200|ft|order=flip}} below sea level. According to Rule the SOSUS data indicates an implosion of ''Thresher'' at 09:18:24, at a depth of {{convert|2,400|ft|order=flip}}, {{convert|400|ft|order=flip}} below her predicted collapse depth. The implosion took 0.1 seconds, too fast for the human nervous system to perceive.<ref name=\"navtimespdf\"/>\n\n==SUBSAFE legacy==\nWhen the Court of Inquiry delivered its final report, it recommended that the Navy implement a more rigorous program of design review and safety inspections during construction. That program, launched in December 1963, was known as [[SUBSAFE]]. From 1915 to 1963, the U.S. Navy lost a total of 16 submarines to non-combat accidents. Since the inception of SUBSAFE only one submarine has suffered a similar fate, and that was {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}}, which sank in 1968 for reasons still undetermined. ''Scorpion'' was not SUBSAFE certified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20130324-NEWS-303240357 |title=USS Thresher Left Legacy of Safety for Submarines|publisher=SeaCoast online |date=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:6707-ArlingtonCemetary-USS ThresherMemorialStone.png|thumb|right|upright|Memorial stone for a lost USS ''Thresher'' sailor, [[Arlington National Cemetery]], July 1967]]\n[[File:USS_Thresher_memorial_dedication_at_Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Thresher'' memorial dedication at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], September 26, 2019]]\n\n=== Permanent ===\n* The chapel at [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]], where the submarine was built, was renamed ''Thresher'' Memorial Chapel.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard E. |last=Winslow III|title=Portsmouth-Built: Submarines of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard |page=161|publisher=Portsmouth Marine Society|year=1985|isbn=091581904X}}</ref>\n* In [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], there is a stone memorial with a plaque honoring all who were lost on ''Thresher''.

She was the U.S. Navy's [[USS Thresher (SS-200)|second submarine]] to be named after the [[thresher shark]].\n\nOn 10 April 1963, ''Thresher'' sank during deep-diving tests about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} east of Boston, Massachusetts, killing all 129 crew and shipyard personnel aboard. It is the second-deadliest submarine incident on record, after the loss of the French submarine [[French submarine Surcouf|''Surcouf'']], in which 130 crew died.<ref name=\"deadliest1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.naval-technology.com/features/featureperil-in-the-depths-the-worlds-worst-submarine-disasters-4191027/ |last=Duddu|first=Praveen|title=Peril in the depths \u2013 the world's worst submarine disasters |website=Navaltechnology.com |date= 6 March 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2018 }}</ref><ref name=Polmar /> Her loss was a watershed for the U.S. Navy, leading to the implementation of a rigorous submarine safety program known as [[SUBSAFE]]. The first [[List of sunken nuclear submarines|nuclear submarine lost at sea]], ''Thresher'' was also the third of four submarine losses that killed over 100 aboard; the others being the [[USS Argonaut (SM-1)|Argonaut]], lost with 102 aboard in World War II, the Surcouf, and the ''[[Kursk submarine disaster|Kursk]]'', which sank with 118 aboard in 2000.\n\n==Significance of design and loss==\nCreated to find and destroy [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines, ''Thresher'' was the fastest and quietest submarine of the day, matching the smaller, contemporary {{sclass-|Skipjack|submarine|4}}. She also had the most advanced weapons system, including launchers for the U.S. Navy's newest [[anti-submarine missile]], the [[UUM-44 SUBROC|SUBROC]], as well as passive and active sonar that could detect vessels at unprecedented range. Shortly after her loss, the [[COMSUBLANT#Officers serving as COMSUBLANT|Commander of Submarine Force Atlantic]] wrote in the March 1964 issue of the [[U.S. Naval Institute]]'s monthly journal ''Proceedings'' that \"the Navy had depended upon this performance to the extent that it had asked for and received authority to build 14 of these ships, as well as an additional 11 submarines with very much the same characteristics. This was the first time since World War II that we had considered our design sufficiently advanced to embark upon construction of a large class of general-purpose attack submarines.\"{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFollowing Navy tradition, this class of subs was originally named ''Thresher'' after the lead boat.  When ''Thresher'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 16 April 1963, the class name was changed to that of the second boat, {{USS|Permit|SSN-594|2}}, and ''Thresher'' is now officially referred to as a [[Permit-class submarine|''Permit''-class submarine]]. Having been \"lost at sea\", ''Thresher'' was not decommissioned by the U.S. Navy and remains on \"Eternal Patrol\".{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:USS Thresher (SSN-593) bow.jpg|thumb|left|''Thresher'' at sea on 24 July 1961]]\nThe contract to build ''Thresher'' was awarded to [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] on 15 January 1958, and her [[keel]] was laid on 28 May 1958. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 July 1960, was sponsored by Mrs. Mary B. Warder<ref name=Polmar>{{cite book |title=The Death of the USS Thresher: The Story Behind History's Deadliest Submarine Disaster |author=Polmar, Norman |authorlink=Norman Polmar |isbn=978-1592283927}}</ref> (wife of [[World War II]] skipper Frederick B. Warder), and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 August 1961, [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Dean L. Axene commanding.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n''Thresher'' conducted lengthy sea trials in the western Atlantic and [[Caribbean Sea]] areas in 1961\u20131962. These tests allowed a thorough evaluation of her many new and complex technological features and weapons. She took part in Nuclear Submarine Exercise (NUSUBEX) 3\u201361 off the northeastern coast of the United States from 18\u201324 September 1961.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 18 October 1961, ''Thresher,'' in company with the diesel-electric submarine {{USS|Cavalla|SS-244|2}}, headed south on a 3-week test and training cruise to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], arriving 2 November. Following customary procedure while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no shore power connection was available in San Juan, the ship's backup [[diesel generator]] was used to carry the [[Hotel electric power|\"hotel\" electrical loads]]. Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load was transferred to the ship's battery.  As most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, lighting and air conditioning were shut down. Without air conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching {{convert|60|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} after about 10 hours. The crew attempted to repair the diesel generator (four men would receive [[Commendation Medal|Navy commendation medals]] for their work that night). After it became apparent that the generator could not be fixed before the battery was depleted, the crew tried to restart the reactor, but the remaining battery charge was insufficient. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. The crew eventually borrowed cables from another ship in the harbor and connected them to the adjacent ''Cavalla'', which started her diesels and provided enough power to allow ''Thresher'' to restart her reactor.<ref>Polmar, pp. 13\u201317</ref>\n\n''Thresher'' conducted further trials and fired test [[torpedo]]es before returning to Portsmouth on 29 November 1961. The boat remained in port through the end of the year, and spent the first two months of 1962 evaluating her [[sonar]] and SUBROC systems. In March, she participated in NUSUBEX 2\u201362 (an exercise designed to improve the tactical capabilities of nuclear submarines) and in [[anti-submarine warfare]] training with Task Group ALPHA.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOff [[Charleston, South Carolina]], ''Thresher'' undertook operations supporting development of the [[UUM-44 SUBROC|SUBROC anti-submarine missile]].  She returned briefly to [[New England]] waters, after which she proceeded to Florida for more SUBROC tests. While moored at [[Port Canaveral, Florida]], the submarine was accidentally struck by a tug, which damaged one of her [[ballast tanks]]. After repairs at [[Groton, Connecticut]], by the [[Electric Boat]] Company, ''Thresher'' went south for more tests and trials off [[Key West, Florida]], then returned northward. The submarine entered Portsmouth Shipyard on 16 July 1962 to begin a scheduled 6-month post-shakedown availability to examine systems and make repairs and corrections as necessary. As is typical with a first-of-class boat, the work took longer than expected, lasting nearly 9 months. The ship was finally recertified and undocked on 8 April 1963.<ref>[http://www.navalhistory.org/2013/04/01/uss-thresher-ssn-593-3-august-1961-10-april-1963 \"USS ''Thresher''\"], article by Vice Admiral E.W.

Earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints,<ref>[http://www.navsea.navy.mil/NewsView.aspx?nw=NewsWires&id=224 50 Years of Steely Purpose-USS Thresher Remembered] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130626170831/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/NewsView.aspx?nw=NewsWires&id=224 |date=26 June 2013 }}.

High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have shorted out one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown (\"[[scram]]\") of the reactor, which in turn caused loss of propulsion. The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine's high-pressure air flasks, moisture which froze and plugged the flasks' flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dock-side tests on ''Thresher''{{'}}s sister sub, {{USS|Tinosa|SSN-606|2}}.

Such flooding would have been a significant sonic event, and no evidence of that can be found in the recorded data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iusscaa.org/articles/brucerule/letter_to_the_deputy_cno.htm|title=Information and Security Issues Associated with the Loss of the USS Thresher|website=Iusscaa.org}}</ref>\n\nSubmarines typically rely on speed and deck angle ([[angle of attack]]) rather than deballasting to surface; they are propelled at an angle towards the surface. Ballast tanks were almost never blown at depth, and doing so could cause the submarine to rocket to the surface out of control. Normal procedure was to drive the submarine to [[periscope]] depth, raise the periscope to verify the area was clear, then blow the tanks and surface the submarine.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAt the time, reactor-plant operating procedures did not allow for a rapid reactor restart following a scram, or even the ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to propel the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main steam system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. ''Thresher''{{'}}s reactor control officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accident&nbsp;\u2013 he had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from [[Naval Nuclear Power School|nuclear power school]], probably followed standard operating procedures and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though ''Thresher'' was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to \"answer bells\" and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. [[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Rickover]] later changed the procedure, creating the \"Fast Recovery Startup\" procedure. The Fast Recovery Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn a dockside simulation of flooding in the engine room, held before ''Thresher'' sailed, it took the watch in charge 20 minutes to isolate a simulated leak in the auxiliary seawater system. At test depth with the reactor shut down, ''Thresher'' would not have had 20 minutes to recover. Even after isolating a short-circuit in the reactor controls, it would have taken nearly 10 minutes to restart the plant.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n''Thresher'' likely [[implosion (mechanical process)|imploded]] at a depth of {{convert|1300|-|2000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy has periodically monitored the environmental conditions of the site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. Naval nuclear-powered craft. These reports provide specifics on the environmental sampling of [[sediment]], water, and marine life which was done to ascertain whether ''Thresher''{{'}}s nuclear reactor has had a significant effect on the deep ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting deep-sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm that there has been no significant effect on the environment. Nuclear fuel in the submarine remains intact.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDeclassified information in December 2018 showed that [[United_States_Navy_Reserve|USNR]] Commander (Dr.) [[Robert Ballard]], the oceanographer credited with locating the wreck of {{RMS|Titanic}}, was sent by the Navy on a mission under cover of the search for ''Titanic'' to map and collect visual data on ''Thresher'' and {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|2}} wrecks.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/25/60minutes/main5773673.shtml The Great Explorer] ''[[60 Minutes]]''; aired 29 November 2009</ref>  Ballard had approached the Navy in 1982 for funding to find ''Titanic'' with his new deep-diving robot submersible.

The boat is descending in slow circles, and announces to ''Skylark'' she is turning to \"Corpen [course] 090.\" At this point, transmission quality from ''Thresher'' begins to noticeably degrade, possibly as a result of [[thermocline]]s.\n|-\n| 09:09 || As an unproven hypothesis that is disputed by acoustic data, the Navy's official investigation stated the likelihood of a brazed pipe-joint rupturing in the engine room. The crew would have attempted to stop the leak; at the same time, the engine room would be filling with a cloud of mist. Under the circumstances, Commander Harvey's likely decision would have been to order full speed, full rise on the fairwater planes, and blowing main ballast in order to surface. The pressurized air rapidly expanding in the pipes [[Joule-Thomson effect|cools down]], condensing moisture and depositing it on intended-as temporary strainers installed in the system to protect the moving parts of the valves during new-construction (should have been removed prior to sea trials)<ref>https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2018/july/declassify-thresher-data</ref>; in only a few seconds the moisture freezes, clogging the strainers and blocking the air flow, halting the effort to blow ballast. Water leaking from the broken pipe most likely causes short circuits leading to an automatic [[scram|shutdown]] of the ship's reactor, causing a loss of propulsion. The logical action at this point would have been for Harvey to order propulsion shifted to a battery-powered backup system. As soon as the flooding was contained, the engine room crew would have begun to restart the reactor, an operation that would be expected to take at least 7&nbsp;minutes.\n|-\n| 09:12 || ''Skylark'' pages ''Thresher'' on the underwater telephone: \"Gertrude [[underwater telephone]] check, K [over].\" With no immediate response (although ''Skylark'' is still unaware of the conditions aboard ''Thresher''), the signal \"K\" is repeated twice.\n|-\n| 09:13 || Harvey reports status via underwater telephone. The transmission is garbled, though some words are recognizable: \"[We are] experiencing minor difficulty, have positive up-angle, attempting to blow.\" The submarine, as a hypothesis, growing heavier from water flooding the engine room, continues its descent, probably tail-first. Another attempt to empty the ballast tanks is performed, again failing due to the formation of ice. Officers on ''Skylark'' could hear the hiss of compressed air over the loudspeaker at this point.\n|-\n| 09:14 || ''Skylark'' acknowledges with a brisk, \"Roger, out,\" awaiting further updates from the SSN.

According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11&nbsp;a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. ''Thresher'' could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so she sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that ''Thresher'' was intact until she imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of ''Skylark'' did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and ''Skylark'' was able to communicate with ''Thresher'', despite the fact that, at test depth, even a small leak would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of ''Thresher'' testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a \"minor problem\".<ref name=\"navtimespdf\"/>\n\nRule interprets the communication \"900\" from ''Thresher'' at 9:17&nbsp;a.m. as a reference to test depth, signifying that ''Thresher'' was {{convert|900|ft|order=flip}} below her test depth of {{convert|1,300|ft|order=flip}}, or {{convert|2,200|ft|order=flip}} below sea level. According to Rule the SOSUS data indicates an implosion of ''Thresher'' at 09:18:24, at a depth of {{convert|2,400|ft|order=flip}}, {{convert|400|ft|order=flip}} below her predicted collapse depth. The implosion took 0.1 seconds, too fast for the human nervous system to perceive.<ref name=\"navtimespdf\"/>\n\n==SUBSAFE legacy==\nWhen the Court of Inquiry delivered its final report, it recommended that the Navy implement a more rigorous program of design review and safety inspections during construction. That program, launched in December 1963, was known as [[SUBSAFE]]. From 1915 to 1963, the U.S. Navy lost a total of 16 submarines to non-combat accidents. Since the inception of SUBSAFE only one submarine has suffered a similar fate, and that was {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}}, which sank in 1968 for reasons still undetermined. ''Scorpion'' was not SUBSAFE certified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20130324-NEWS-303240357 |title=USS Thresher Left Legacy of Safety for Submarines|publisher=SeaCoast online |date=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:6707-ArlingtonCemetary-USS ThresherMemorialStone.png|thumb|right|upright|Memorial stone for a lost USS ''Thresher'' sailor, [[Arlington National Cemetery]], July 1967]]\n[[File:USS_Thresher_memorial_dedication_at_Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Thresher'' memorial dedication at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], September 26, 2019]]\n\n=== Permanent ===\n* The chapel at [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]], where the submarine was built, was renamed ''Thresher'' Memorial Chapel.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard E. |last=Winslow III|title=Portsmouth-Built: Submarines of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard |page=161|publisher=Portsmouth Marine Society|year=1985|isbn=091581904X}}</ref>\n* In [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], there is a stone memorial with a plaque honoring all who were lost on ''Thresher''.

Hotline Communications' main activity was the publishing and distribution of a multi-purpose client/server [[communication software]] product named ''Hotline Connect'', informally called, simply, ''Hotline''. Initially, Hotline Communications sought a wide audience for its products, and organizations as diverse as [[Avid Technology]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer Australia]], and public high schools used Hotline.

The [[source code]] for the Hotline applications was based on a class library, \"AppWarrior\" (AW), which Hinkley wrote. AppWarrior would later become litigious, as Hinkley wrote parts of it while he was employed by an Australian company, Redrock Holdings. Six other fans of Hotline, David Murphy, Alex King, Phil Hilton, Jason Roks, David Bordin, and Terrance Gregory, joined Adam Hinkley's efforts to promote and market the Hotline programs, working day and night and using the company's own products to stay in touch from across the US, Canada, and Australia. Eventually, Canadian Jason Roks approached Adam Hinkley and encouraged him to move to Toronto, where Hotline Communications, Ltd. was incorporated.

The Hotline protocol was a [[binary protocol]] which accounted for its high speed efficient transfers in the days when most internet users still used [[modem]]s and [[dialup]]. The protocol was [[reverse engineered]] by the [[internet community]], leading to a wide variety of third-party clients being written in [[RealBasic]], one of the few easy-to-use development environments available on the Macintosh at the time.\n\n''Hotline Connect'' consisted of three applications, distributed separately (via Internet download or on promotional CDs):\n* '''Hotline Client''': an application used to access ''Hotline'' [[server (computing)|servers]] set up by users running the ''Hotline Server'' software. Hotline Connect users with a client installed could connect to servers they knew using the [[server (computing)|host]]'s IP address.\n* '''Hotline Server''': an easy-to-configure server application.\n* '''Hotline Tracker''': a name server, used to keep track of the IP addresses of several ''Hotline'' servers.\n\n==Hotline successors==\nA company named Haxial Software (rumored to be Adam Hinkley){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} released a Hotline-like product named KDX.\n\nJ\u00f6rn and Mirko Hartmann released similar software deliberately kept Mac-only called [[Carracho]] in 1998 Carracho GbR - Welcome, still used today by a small, tight-knit group of users. There have also been several third-party applications that implement the Hotline protocol.\n\nThere have been several open-source versions of the Hotline Client and Server suite, which were not based on the official source code, and provide several protocol enhancements (also known as HOPE - HOtline Protocol Extension).\nSome versions also support an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] bridge or KDX bridge.

Hotline Connect users with a client installed could connect to servers they knew using the [[server (computing)|host]]'s IP address.\n* '''Hotline Server''': an easy-to-configure server application.\n* '''Hotline Tracker''': a name server, used to keep track of the IP addresses of several ''Hotline'' servers.\n\n==Hotline successors==\nA company named Haxial Software (rumored to be Adam Hinkley){{cn|date=July 2018}} released a Hotline-like product named KDX.\n\nJ\u00f6rn and Mirko Hartmann released similar software deliberately kept Mac-only called [[Carracho]] in 1998 Carracho GbR - Welcome, still used today by a small, tight-knit group of users. There have also been several third-party applications that implement the Hotline protocol.\n\nThere have been several open-source versions of the Hotline Client and Server suite, which were not based on the official source code, and provide several protocol enhancements (also known as HOPE - HOtline Protocol Extension).\nSome versions also support an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] bridge or KDX bridge. Most of the work on the Hotline enhancements have been done by r0r (HOPE, KDX), kang (IRC) and Devin Teske. See <!--[[KDX (software)|KDX]], and -->[[Darknet]] for details.\n\nHotline's largest community Mixed Blood, started by Prime Chuck and SAINT in 1998, is still active to this day on Wired. Wired is similar to Hotline and developed by [[Zanka software]].\n\nAnother very large hotline server of the same time, Not All Mine, or notallmine.net, converted to HTML format and went private around 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915000000*/http://notallmine.net|title=Wayback Machine|date=September 15, 2005|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern clients (constantly being updated)==\n* Pitbull Pro, a remake of the original OS9/X client (Windows)\n\n==Open source clients==\n* Fidelio - open-source Hotline client, no longer updated since 2002 (Linux/Unix)\n* mhxd - open-source Hotline server and client\n* synhxd - open-source Hotline server and client\n* gtkhx - open-source Hotline client, no longer updated since 2001 (Linux/Unix)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=January 2009}}\n'''Company and product history'''\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://bigredh.com Wayback Machine search results for 'bigredh.com']\", ''[[Internet Archive]] Wayback Machine''.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin B{{sub|12}} there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.

The central metal ion is [[cobalt]]. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a [[dimethylbenzimidazole]] group. The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>). Historically, the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur.

Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible.

In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin B{{sub|12}} there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.

The central metal ion is [[cobalt]]. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a [[dimethylbenzimidazole]] group. The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>). Historically, the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter.

Shorb knew that the same liver extract was used to treat pernicious anemia (her father-in-law had died from the disease), and concluded that LLD could be developed as an assay method to identify the active compound. While at the University of Maryland she received a small grant from [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and in collaboration with [[Karl Folkers]] from that company, developed the LLD assay.
