The borough was {{convert|32|sqmi|km2}}, with a population of just over 39,000.\n\nTogether with the neighbouring district of [[Larne Borough Council|Larne]] and small parts of [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] and [[Moyle District Council|Moyle]], it formed the [[East Antrim (disambiguation)|East Antrim constituency]] for elections to the [[Westminster Parliament]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].\n\n==Mayors of Carrickfergus==\n\n===List of Mayors and Sheriffs of Carrickfergus Corporation from 1523 to the passing of The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840===\n\n'''Henry VIII'''\n*1523 William Fythe Thomas Unchile, Henry Fythe} These are called Bayliffs\n'''Edward VI'''\n*1568\u20131569 Thomas Stephenson John Teade, Nicholas Wilis\n*1569\u20131570 John Teade Nicholas Rogers, John Flude\n*1570\u20131571 Rychard Sendall Wolston Elderton, Cornell O'Kane\n*1571\u20131572 Edward Brown William Dobbin, Patrick Savadge, Junior\n*1572\u20131573 Captain William Piers Wolston Elderton, John Dyer\n*1573\u20131574 Thomas Stephenson Gregory Grafton, William Field, Senior\n*1574\u20131575 William Piers, Junior Humphrey Potts, John Cockrill\n*1575\u20131576 William Piers, Junior John Cockrill, John Dishford\n*1576\u20131577 William Dobbin John Dyer, John Dishford\n*1577\u20131578 William Piers, Junior Robert Magye, Robert Warcope\n*1578\u20131579 Nicholas Wills Humphrey Johnston, Mychaell Savadge\n*1579\u20131580 Captain Thomas Sackforde Barnabic Ward, Thomas Stephenson\n*1580\u20131581 William Dobbin Humphrey Johnston, John Dyer\n*1581\u20131582 Captain Thomas Sackforde and Nicholas Wills John Savadge, Phellimy Magye\n*1582\u20131583 Captain William Piers John Dishford, James Dobbin\n*1583\u20131584 William Dobbin John Dyer, Rychard Thomas\n*1584\u20131585 Captain Nicholas Dawtrey Mathew Jones, John Scully\n*1585\u20131586 William Dobbin John Dishford, Mychael Savadge\n*1586\u20131587 Thomas Stephenson Humphrey Johnston, John Scully\n*1587\u20131588 John Savadge John Dyer, James Dobbin\n*1588\u20131589 William Dobbin Thomas Vaughan, John Lugg\n*1589\u20131590 Charles Eggerton James Dobbin, Roger Cooper\n*1590\u20131591 Matthew Jones William Savadge, Henrie Ockforde} John Dyer, dep\n*1591\u20131592 Humphrey Johnston Moyses Hill, Roger Cooper\n*1592\u20131593 John Dallwaye Alexander Haynes, James Dobbin\n*1593\u20131594 Nicholas Wills and M.

Both of these technologies are described as follows: \n \n===Prognostics===\n\nPrognostics aims to make accurate predictions of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery before a failure occurs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heng|first1=Aiwina|last2=Zhang|first2=Sheng|last3=Tan|first3=Andy C.C.|last4=Mathew|first4=Joseph|date=April 2009|title=Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=724\u2013739|bibcode=2009MSSP...23..724H|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.06.009}}</ref> Current prognostic approaches can be categorized into three classes, namely model-based, data-driven and hybrid prognostics approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Si|first1=Xiao-Sheng|last2=Wang|first2=Wenbin|last3=Hu|first3=Chang-Hua|last4=Zhou|first4=Dong-Hua|date=August 2011|title=Remaining useful life estimation \u2013 A review on the statistical data driven approaches|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2010.11.018}}</ref> Rotating machinery is of critical concern in the manufacturing industry.

However, very few studies have been carried out on stator current monitoring or acoustic signals. A preliminary study by Tandon et al. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tandon|first1=N.|last2=Yadava|first2=G.S.|last3=Ramakrishna|first3=K.M.|date=January 2007|title=A comparison of some condition monitoring techniques for the detection of defect in induction motor ball bearings|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=21|issue=1|pages=244\u2013256|bibcode=2007MSSP...21..244T|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2005.08.005}}</ref>\u00a0suggested that current signatures are inexpensive and easy to measure, but acoustic signals reveal fault characteristics early.\n\n===Diagnostics===\n\nThe rationale for fault diagnosis is to inspect the machine health status i.e. whether it is healthy or has a fault. In industrial applications, diagnostic is typically implemented to detect and identify the failure modes within a system or sub-system. In this process, sensors data from multiple resources are analyzed by extraction of time and frequency domain features and a model is designed to correspond these information to the failure modes of the system. Using diverse analytic models and a systematic diagnosis approach provide a rich environment for components accurate diagnosis and real-time monitoring.  In manufacturing systems, bearing, shaft, electric motors, and gearbox are the most frequently studied components for accurate and reliable diagnostics.\n\n==Enabling Technologies==\n\nRecent emerging technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, and industrial AI technologies will enable operation of industries in a flexible, efficient, and with near-zero downtime. The aim of these enabling technologies is to aid the realization of intelligent manufacturing systems based on integration with process monitoring hardware and software, signal processing techniques, sensor fusions tools, diagnosis and prognosis approaches.\n\n=== Internet of things (IoT)===\nThe basic concept is the pervasive presence of things\u2013 such as sensors, actuators, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, etc. \u2013 around us which are able to interact and cooperate with each other to achieve common goals.

Dr. Jay Lee {{fact|date=April 2020}} first introduced the nZDM concept in 2000 while working for NSF I/UCRC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/home.jsp|title=NSF IUCRC {{!}} Home|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> in the area of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). The key focus was to measure the degradation of machines and processes to predict and prevent potential issues. Analytical techniques based on Big Data, along with a systematic toolbox approach, were first proposed by the IMS Center in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|date=December 2003|title=E-manufacturing\u2014fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|volume=19|issue=6|pages=501\u2013507|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imscenter.net/|title=Intelligent maintenance system|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n==Main Elements==\n\nNear-zero downtime manufacturing is based on two main technologies, namely, Accurate Diagnostics and Real-time Prognostics. Both of these technologies are described as follows: \n \n===Prognostics===\n\nPrognostics aims to make accurate predictions of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery before a failure occurs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heng|first1=Aiwina|last2=Zhang|first2=Sheng|last3=Tan|first3=Andy C.C.|last4=Mathew|first4=Joseph|date=April 2009|title=Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=724\u2013739|bibcode=2009MSSP...23..724H|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.06.009}}</ref> Current prognostic approaches can be categorized into three classes, namely model-based, data-driven and hybrid prognostics approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Si|first1=Xiao-Sheng|last2=Wang|first2=Wenbin|last3=Hu|first3=Chang-Hua|last4=Zhou|first4=Dong-Hua|date=August 2011|title=Remaining useful life estimation \u2013 A review on the statistical data driven approaches|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2010.11.018}}</ref> Rotating machinery is of critical concern in the manufacturing industry. Hence, the majority of the studies in literature concentrated on prognostics and health management (PHM) applications, including but not limited to, standard rotary machinery components, such as bearings, gears, shafts, and motors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Wu|first2=Fangji|last3=Zhao|first3=Wenyu|last4=Ghaffari|first4=Masoud|last5=Liao|first5=Linxia|last6=Siegel|first6=David|date=January 2014|title=Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systems\u2014Reviews, methodology and applications|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=42|issue=1\u20132|pages=314\u2013334|bibcode=2014MSSP...42..314L|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.06.004}}</ref> A significant contribution has been made in are using vibration signals for prognostics. However, very few studies have been carried out on stator current monitoring or acoustic signals. A preliminary study by Tandon et al. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tandon|first1=N.|last2=Yadava|first2=G.S.|last3=Ramakrishna|first3=K.M.|date=January 2007|title=A comparison of some condition monitoring techniques for the detection of defect in induction motor ball bearings|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=21|issue=1|pages=244\u2013256|bibcode=2007MSSP...21..244T|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2005.08.005}}</ref>\u00a0suggested that current signatures are inexpensive and easy to measure, but acoustic signals reveal early fault characteristics.\n\n===Diagnostics===\n\nThe rationale for fault diagnosis is to inspect the machine health status i.e. whether it is healthy or has a fault. In industrial applications, diagnostic is typically implemented to detect and identify the failure modes within a system or sub-system. In this process, sensors data from multiple resources are analyzed by extraction of time and frequency domain features and a model is designed to correspond these information to the failure modes of the system. Using diverse analytic models and a systematic diagnosis approach provide a rich environment for components accurate diagnosis and real-time monitoring.  In manufacturing systems, bearing, shaft, electric motors, and gearbox are the most frequently studied components for accurate and reliable diagnostics.\n\n==Enabling Technologies==\n\nRecent emerging technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, and industrial AI technologies will enable operation of industries in a flexible, efficient, and with near-zero downtime. The aim of these enabling technologies is to aid the realization of intelligent manufacturing systems based on integration with process monitoring hardware and software, signal processing techniques, sensor fusions tools, diagnosis and prognosis approaches.\n\n=== Internet of things (IoT)===\nThe basic concept is the pervasive presence of things\u2013 such as sensors, actuators, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, etc. \u2013 around us which are able to interact and cooperate with each other to achieve common goals.

Where maintenance activities such as prognosis and diagnostic are offered as on-demand services to different clients in manufacturing industry.\n\n===Cyber-Physical Systems===\nInformed decisions for maintenance activities require advanced connectivity and integration of physical systems and cyber computational resources. This interconnectivity is realized through 5-level Cyber Physical System known as 5C architecture.\n\n===Industrial AI===\n(Industrial AI) is a systematic discipline to enable engineers to systematically develop and deploy AI algorithms with repeating and consistent successes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jay |title=Industrial AI: Applications with Sustainable Performance |date=2020 |publisher=Springer Singapore |isbn=978-981-15-2143-0 |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811521430?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmpb0BRCBARIsAG7y4za5XZCtTMODWR1WDccxy8OTy0p37ecVM_DnooyKkSxAcQEEiy0IOMYaAnokEALw_wcB |language=en}}</ref> The traditional definition of industrial AI usually refers to the application of [[artificial intelligence]] to industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last1=Yao|first1=Mariya|title=4 Unique Challenges Of Industrial Artificial Intelligence|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2017/04/14/unique-challenges-of-industrial-artificial-intelligence-general-electric/#59e377551305|website=Forbes|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> and in a more elaborate fashion,  Successful implementation of Industrial AI will improve decision making and provide enhanced insight to business users - whether that\u2019s reducing asset downtime, improving manufacturing efficiency, automating production, predicting demand, optimizing inventory levels or enhancing risk management.

Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.<ref>van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation, and population size. Biol. Conserv. 101:217-28\n</ref>\n\nIn scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term \"habitat fragmentation\" applies in cases of [[habitat loss]], or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of \"habitat fragmentation\" per se<ref name=\":1\" /> would refer to the loss of habitat area as \"habitat loss\" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.\n\nFurthermore, habitat fragmentation is considered as an invasive threat to [[biodiversity]], due to its implications of affecting large number of [[species]] than [[Invasive species|biological invasions]], [[overexploitation]], or [[pollution]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/habitat-fragmentation|title=Habitat Fragmentation - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> (Haddad et al. 2015). \n\nAdditionally, the effects of habitat fragmentation damage the ability for species, such as [[Native plant|native plants]], to be able to effectively adapt to their changing environments. Ultimately, this prevents [[gene flow]] from one generation of [[Population genetics|population]] to the next, especially for species living in smaller population sizes. Whereas, for species of larger populations have more [[Mutation|genetic mutations]] which can arise and [[genetic recombination]] impacts which can increase species survival in those environments. Overall, habitat fragmentation results in habitat disintegration and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] which both tie into destructing [[biodiversity]] as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/habitat-fragmentation|title=Habitat Fragmentation - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> \n\n== Causes ==\n\n===Natural causes===\nEvidence of [[habitat destruction]] through natural processes such as [[volcanism]], fire, and [[climate change]] is found in the fossil record.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\"/>{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} For example, [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica]] 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\"/>\n\n===Human causes===\nHabitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when [[native plant]]s is cleared for human activities such as [[agriculture]], [[Subdivision (land)|rural development]], [[urbanization]] and the creation of [[hydroelectric]] reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of [[slash and burn]] farming in [[tropical forest]]s. In the wheat belt of central-western [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the [[tall grass prairie]] of [[North America]] has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.\n\n=== Endogenous vs. exogenous  ===\nThere are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous is a process that develops as a part of species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior, and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to a decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|date=February 7, 2007|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265\u2013280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|ref=1}}</ref>\n\n==Implications ==\n\n=== Habitat Loss and Biodiversity ===\nOne of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects [[biodiversity]] is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms.

In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be \"rescued\" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of [[Colonisation (biology)|immigrants]] by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the [[Columbia spotted frog]] are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.<ref name = Funk>{{cite journal |author1=Funk W.C. |author2=Greene A.E. |author3=Corn P.S. |author4=Allendorf F.W. | year = 2005 | title = High dispersal in a frog species suggests that it is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation | url = | journal = [[Biology Letters|Biol.

Microclimatic changes in light, temperature, and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. [[wildfire|Fires]] become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species that require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation. Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% [[biodiversity loss]].<ref>Quammen, David (1997), \"The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction\" (Scribner)</ref>\n\nMuch of the remaining terrestrial [[wildlife]] habitat in many third world countries has experienced fragmentation through the development of [[Urban sprawl|urban expansion]] such as roads interfering with [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. Aquatic species\u2019 habitats have been fragmented by [[Dam|dams]] and [[Interbasin transfer|water diversions]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwf.org/Home/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Threats-to-Wildlife/Habitat-Loss|title=Habitat Loss|website=National Wildlife Federation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> These fragments of habitat may not be large or connected enough to support species that need a large territory where they can find mates and food. The loss and fragmentation of habitats makes it difficult for migratory species to find places to rest and feed along their migration routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwf.org/Home/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Threats-to-Wildlife/Habitat-Loss|title=Habitat Loss|website=National Wildlife Federation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Informed Conservation===\nHabitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming [[threatened]] or [[endangered]]. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases, the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible contiguous piece of land. In rare cases, a [[conservation reliant species]] may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats. This ongoing debate is often referred to as [[SLOSS debate|SLOSS]] (Single Large or Several Small).\n\nOne solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting [[Habitat corridor|corridors]] of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Crossings: Animals survive with bridges and tunnels|url=http://www.wilderutopia.com/environment/wildlife/wildlife-crossings-animals-survive-bridges-tunnels/|publisher=Wilder Eutopia|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=2013-05-19}}</ref> This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat.\n\nAnother mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.\n\nThe best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of [[metapopulation]]s [[island biogeography]].\n\n=== Genetic Risks ===\nAs the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|date=1 January 1998|title=Small and Declining Populations|journal=Conservation Science and Action|language=en|pages=116\u2013134|doi=10.1002/9781444313499.ch6|isbn=9781444313499}}</ref> Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last1=Frankham|first1=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Briscoe|first3=David A.|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge}}</ref> Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the [[genetic diversity]] found in the previously continuous habitat. In these cases, processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity, such as [[adaptation]], have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change. However in some scenarios, where subsets of genetic diversity are partitioned among multiple habitat fragments, almost all original genetic diversity can be maintained despite each individual fragment displaying a reduced subset of diversity.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |last1=Borrell |first1=James S. |last2=Wang |first2=Nian |last3=Nichols |first3=Richard A. |last4=Buggs |first4=Richard J.

Populations can maintain genetic diversity through [[Animal migration|migration]]. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration are typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Andrea T. |last2=Ison |first2=Jennifer L. |last3=Ashley |first3=Mary V. |last4=Howe |first4=Henry F. |title=The Paradox of Forest Fragmentation Genetics |journal=Conservation Biology |date=August 2008 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=878\u2013885 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x |pmid=18544089 }}</ref> most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nReduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in [[inbreeding]] between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called [[inbreeding depression]]. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of [[homozygosity]] increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last1=Pavlova |first1=Alexandra |last2=Beheregaray |first2=Luciano B. |last3=Coleman |first3=Rhys |last4=Gilligan |first4=Dean |last5=Harrisson |first5=Katherine A. |last6=Ingram |first6=Brett A. |last7=Kearns |first7=Joanne |last8=Lamb |first8=Annika M. |last9=Lintermans |first9=Mark |last10=Lyon |first10=Jarod |last11=Nguyen |first11=Thuy T.

Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic makeup of populations and always leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, research suggests that some tree species may be resilient to the negative consequences of genetic drift until population size is as small as ten individuals or less.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Adaptation ====\nIn order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift.

This is important because social interactions can determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result, alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator-prey relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology  |date=2007 |volume=85 |issue=10 |pages=1065\u20131079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094 }}</ref>\n\n==== Predation Behaviours ====\nHabitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the number of species and the members of those species.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so-called \"behavioral space race\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=720\u2013735|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00642.x }}</ref> The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are a refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to species extinction.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===== Boreal Woodland Caribous =====\nIn the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia, the effects of fragmentation are demonstrated.

Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas. For example, if a cleared area is [[reforestation|reforested]] or allowed to [[natural regeneration|regenerate]], the increasing [[structural diversity]] of the [[vegetation]] will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments.  However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.\n\nForest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated. A large number of small forest \"islands\" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.<ref>, Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands.

More specifically, [[habitat]] fragmentation is a process by which large and contiguous habitats get divided into smaller, isolated patches of habitats (Fahrig, 2003).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fahrig|first=Lenore|date=2019|title=Habitat fragmentation: A long and tangled tale|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12839|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33\u201341|doi=10.1111/geb.12839|issn=1466-8238}}</ref> \n\n[[Image:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Deforestation]] and increased [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|road-building in the Amazon Rainforest]] are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource-extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]\n\n==Definition==\nThe term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena:\n* Reduction in the total area of the habitat\n* Decrease of the interior: [[edge effect|edge]] ratio\n* Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat\n* Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches\n* Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat\n\n\"fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat\" (van den Berg et al. 2001){{Failed verification|date=April 2018}}. Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.<ref>van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation, and population size. Biol. Conserv. 101:217-28\n</ref>\n\nIn scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term \"habitat fragmentation\" applies in cases of [[habitat loss]], or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of \"habitat fragmentation\" per se<ref name=\":1\" /> would refer to the loss of habitat area as \"habitat loss\" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.\n\nFurthermore, habitat fragmentation is considered as an invasive threat to [[biodiversity]], due to its implications of affecting large number of [[species]] than [[Invasive species|biological invasions]], [[overexploitation]], or [[pollution]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/habitat-fragmentation|title=Habitat Fragmentation - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> (Haddad et al. 2015). \n\nAdditionally, the effects of habitat fragmentation damage the ability for species, such as [[Native plant|native plants]], to be able to effectively adapt to their changing environments. Ultimately, this prevents [[gene flow]] from one generation of [[Population genetics|population]] to the next, especially for species living in smaller population sizes. Whereas, for species of larger populations have more [[Mutation|genetic mutations]] which can arise and [[genetic recombination]] impacts which can increase species survival in those environments. Overall, habitat fragmentation results in habitat disintegration and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] which both tie into destructing [[biodiversity]] as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/habitat-fragmentation|title=Habitat Fragmentation - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> \n\n== Causes ==\n\n===Natural causes===\nEvidence of [[habitat destruction]] through natural processes such as [[volcanism]], fire, and [[climate change]] is found in the fossil record.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\"/>{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} For example, [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica]] 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\"/>\n\n===Human causes===\nHabitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when [[native plant]]s is cleared for human activities such as [[agriculture]], [[Subdivision (land)|rural development]], [[urbanization]] and the creation of [[hydroelectric]] reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of [[slash and burn]] farming in [[tropical forest]]s. In the wheat belt of central-western [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the [[tall grass prairie]] of [[North America]] has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.\n\n=== Endogenous vs. exogenous  ===\nThere are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous is a process that develops as a part of species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior, and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to a decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|date=February 7, 2007|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265\u2013280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|ref=1}}</ref>\n\n==Implications ==\n\n=== Habitat Loss and Biodiversity ===\nOne of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects [[biodiversity]] is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms.

In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be \"rescued\" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of [[Colonisation (biology)|immigrants]] by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the [[Columbia spotted frog]] are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.<ref name = Funk>{{cite journal |author1=Funk W.C. |author2=Greene A.E. |author3=Corn P.S. |author4=Allendorf F.W. | year = 2005 | title = High dispersal in a frog species suggests that it is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation | url = | journal = [[Biology Letters|Biol.

Microclimatic changes in light, temperature, and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. [[wildfire|Fires]] become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species that require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation. Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% [[biodiversity loss]].<ref>Quammen, David (1997), \"The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction\" (Scribner)</ref>\n\nMuch of the remaining terrestrial [[wildlife]] habitat in many third world countries has experienced fragmentation through the development of [[Urban sprawl|urban expansion]] such as roads interfering with [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. Aquatic species\u2019 habitats have been fragmented by [[Dam|dams]] and [[Interbasin transfer|water diversions]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwf.org/Home/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Threats-to-Wildlife/Habitat-Loss|title=Habitat Loss|website=National Wildlife Federation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> These fragments of habitat may not be large or connected enough to support species that need a large territory where they can find mates and food. The loss and fragmentation of habitats makes it difficult for migratory species to find places to rest and feed along their migration routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwf.org/Home/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Threats-to-Wildlife/Habitat-Loss|title=Habitat Loss|website=National Wildlife Federation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Informed Conservation===\nHabitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming [[threatened]] or [[endangered]]. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases, the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible contiguous piece of land. In rare cases, a [[conservation reliant species]] may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats. This ongoing debate is often referred to as [[SLOSS debate|SLOSS]] (Single Large or Several Small).\n\nOne solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting [[Habitat corridor|corridors]] of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Crossings: Animals survive with bridges and tunnels|url=http://www.wilderutopia.com/environment/wildlife/wildlife-crossings-animals-survive-bridges-tunnels/|publisher=Wilder Eutopia|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=2013-05-19}}</ref> This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat.\n\nAnother mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.\n\nThe best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of [[metapopulation]]s [[island biogeography]].\n\n=== Genetic Risks ===\nAs the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|date=1 January 1998|title=Small and Declining Populations|journal=Conservation Science and Action|language=en|pages=116\u2013134|doi=10.1002/9781444313499.ch6|isbn=9781444313499}}</ref> Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last1=Frankham|first1=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Briscoe|first3=David A.|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge}}</ref> Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the [[genetic diversity]] found in the previously continuous habitat. In these cases, processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity, such as [[adaptation]], have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change. However in some scenarios, where subsets of genetic diversity are partitioned among multiple habitat fragments, almost all original genetic diversity can be maintained despite each individual fragment displaying a reduced subset of diversity.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |last1=Borrell |first1=James S. |last2=Wang |first2=Nian |last3=Nichols |first3=Richard A. |last4=Buggs |first4=Richard J.

Populations can maintain genetic diversity through [[Animal migration|migration]]. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration are typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Andrea T. |last2=Ison |first2=Jennifer L. |last3=Ashley |first3=Mary V. |last4=Howe |first4=Henry F. |title=The Paradox of Forest Fragmentation Genetics |journal=Conservation Biology |date=August 2008 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=878\u2013885 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x |pmid=18544089 }}</ref> most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nReduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in [[inbreeding]] between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called [[inbreeding depression]]. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of [[homozygosity]] increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last1=Pavlova |first1=Alexandra |last2=Beheregaray |first2=Luciano B. |last3=Coleman |first3=Rhys |last4=Gilligan |first4=Dean |last5=Harrisson |first5=Katherine A. |last6=Ingram |first6=Brett A. |last7=Kearns |first7=Joanne |last8=Lamb |first8=Annika M. |last9=Lintermans |first9=Mark |last10=Lyon |first10=Jarod |last11=Nguyen |first11=Thuy T.

Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic makeup of populations and always leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, research suggests that some tree species may be resilient to the negative consequences of genetic drift until population size is as small as ten individuals or less.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Adaptation ====\nIn order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift.

This is important because social interactions can determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result, alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator-prey relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology  |date=2007 |volume=85 |issue=10 |pages=1065\u20131079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094 }}</ref>\n\n==== Predation Behaviours ====\nHabitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the number of species and the members of those species.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so-called \"behavioral space race\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=720\u2013735|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00642.x }}</ref> The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are a refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to species extinction.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===== Boreal Woodland Caribous =====\nIn the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia, the effects of fragmentation are demonstrated.

Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas. For example, if a cleared area is [[reforestation|reforested]] or allowed to [[natural regeneration|regenerate]], the increasing [[structural diversity]] of the [[vegetation]] will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments.  However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.\n\nForest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated. A large number of small forest \"islands\" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.<ref>, Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands.

In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat.

As a 4-year-old, he began building little jumps behind his house, and at 5 he joined the local skier club where he developed a passion for [[Mogul skiing]]. He was 14 when he won his first French National Junior Championships in the mogul division. Even from a young age, he was described by those close to him as \"skiing with flair and innovation\".\n\nHe is the brother of snowboarder [[Mirabelle Thovex]].\n\n===Professional skiing (1997\u20132007 the freestyle years)===\nIn 1997 Candide signed his first professional sponsorship contract with leading Australian action sports brand [[Quiksilver]].\n\nIn 2000 Candide returned to the United States to compete in the Gravity Games in Mammoth, California, where he won the Big Air contest.

Candide proceeded to impress his peers by sticking the 'jump heard around the world'; a 110-foot (33.5 meter) cork 540 tail grab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powder.com/stories/a-brief-history-of-superpark/ |title=Superpark Revisited: a history of the legendary proving ground |publisher=Powder.com |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> On the contest side of things, Candide won the Halfpipe and Big Air contests at that year's X Games in Australia. Candide's injury from the previous season had left him with plenty of down time. He took advantage of that to launch his career as a filmmaker and created 'WW Prod'. That same year his first production company went on to release the first of 8 films under the 'Rastafaride' title, selling more than 10 000 DVDs of the first video worldwide. He was also voted 'Skier of the Year' by the European specialized media.\n\n2002 was a very busy year. Candide was constantly filming with his own production company and with others. He continued competing and his contest results remained solid, dominating the Big Air events, winning two in New Zealand, one in Lebanon and another in Switzerland. He earned 2 podiums at the US Open; 2nd place in Superpipe, and 3rd place in Slopestyle.\n\nIn 2003 according to the Association of Freeskiing Professionals, \"Candide Thovex and CR Johnson change the face of halfpipe skiing at Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado by going bigger than any of the snowboarders.\"<ref>http://www.afpworldtour.com/rfs/clients/afp/resources/HistoryofFreeskiing_Timeline.pdf</ref> Candide won his second X-Games gold medal.<ref>[http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20090122/SPORTS/901229870/1059&title=Superpipe%20stunner%20in%20Aspen Superpipe stunner in Aspen]</ref> This time it was in Superpipe,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp__qrNtFX4 |title=X Games 2003: Candide Thovex |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-11-05 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> an incredible achievement, since he couldn't practice at home because at the time there weren't any superpipes in Europe.  Candide celebrated by hosting the first ever 'Candide Invitational' at his home resort, La Clusaz. The event gathered the world's best freestylers for a few days of fun and to explore the limits of what could be done on a pair of skis. He also signed a sponsorship deal to develop a pro model with Salomon. This was another season that ended with another injury to his cruciate ligaments, but this time in his right knee.\n\nIn 2004 Candide continued to push back the boundaries of his sport, performing the first ever '810\u00b0 to rail' and cementing his reputation as the master of all 'new school' tricks and techniques. He was part of Powder's Reader Poll in 2004 where he was placed 6th.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.powder.com/powder-awards-archive/2004-powder-awards-results/|title=2004 Powder Awards Results {{!}} POWDER Magazine|date=2009-11-07|work=POWDER Magazine|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the Candide Invitational event was voted best European freestyle event by the international specialised press. The same season Candide inked a multi-year deal with Rossignol to become the leading ambassador for their 'Scratch' program.\n\nIn 2006 Candide decided to see how high it was possible to fly on skis. To do so, he helped to design and build one of the largest quarter-pipes ever and proceeded to set a world record with a jump of 33 feet (about 10 meters) above the coping.<ref>{{youtube|x-hsYz58AAU|}}</ref>\n\n2007 was a year of highs and lows; Candide won his third gold medal at [[Winter X Games XI|2007 in Slopestyle]],<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/athlete/3013725/candide-thovex |title=Candide Thovex \u2013 X Games |publisher=Xgames.espn.go.com |accessdate=2015-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153041/http://xgames.espn.go.com/athlete/3013725/candide-thovex |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xh37rl_candide-thovex-x-games-gold-slopestyle-2007_sport|title=Candide Thovex X GAMES gold slopestyle 2007}}</ref> with a record score of 95/100. However, he ended his season coming up short on 'The Big Bertha',<ref>{{youtube|KDjIPJBq97s|}}</ref> another over-the-top jump he'd dreamed up, which resulted in a fracture to his L1 vertebrae. At first, doctors thought he might never be able to ski again or at least that he would never ski at the same level as before; no more tricks, no more big airs.\n\n===Professional skiing (2008\u20132018 big mountain freestyle and filmmaking)===\nReturning from injury in 2008, Candide signed on to ride for Coreupt skis. He also put all his energy into his event, designing features of all shapes and sizes to blend in perfectly with the terrain. At the same time, he started skiing again, but only in perfect powder and far from the crowds. He rode alone, with the exception of his sole companion, Simon Favier who was there to capture all of the action on film. He didn't compete in a single contest.  He was simultaneously putting together his first documentary feature 'The Candide Invitational Story',.<ref>{{youtube|fWrjugaKetE|}}</ref>\n\nThe final product of his adventures riding and filming with Simon Favier was entitled 'Candide Kamera'<ref>{{youtube|B95Eq-5xCC8|}}</ref> and was released in 2009. The images were focused exclusively on riding in the backcountry and big mountain freestyle. Wanting to continue in the same vein, Candide spent the entire season riding powder and filming.\n\nAfter winning a number of major freestyle contests, 2010 marked a sensational return to competition, but now Candide had turned his sights on unspoiled and unforgiving backcountry faces. However, he wanted to keep things discreet since he hadn't competed since his injury. His comeback started with an invitation to compete in the Red Bull Line Catcher in Vars, France, a prestigious hybrid event, which blends freestyle and freeriding. He was nervous and unsure of his ability to keep up with the other competitors. In spite of his uncertainties, he went on to win the contest.<ref>{{youtube|uNQrWhxiYms|}}</ref> A few weeks later, Candide Thovex was invited to and won the Chamonix stage of the Freeride World Tour (FWT).<ref>{{youtube|Ajes1eq2itA|}}</ref> The win in Chamonix was a deciding factor that convinced him to compete on the tour for the entire season.

Over the course of his professional career he has starred in, and produced numerous videos. Including numerous video segments, Candide starred in WW production's Rastafaride 7th Heaven.  In 2011, he set to work on a project to document his past with an eye on what the future held in store for him. He skied and filmed the best backcountry conditions available on the planet.\n\nThe film 'Few Words' was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL2sCAvM29A |title=Few Words Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> It was an immediate success.

Filmed entirely from his point of view, 'One of Those Days' (OOTD) was claimed by Powder magazine editor John Clary Davies \"The best skier on the planet at his home hill.

The French language Swiss news website La C\u00f4te also mentioned Candide, \"setting the bar in the stratosphere\" in the title of its article and noted the viral performance of the video reporting that \"at 8pm, barely two hours after it had been posted online, the video had already been viewed more than 2.2 million times on his Facebook page and more than 2 million times on the specialized platform Zapiks\". (26)\n\nThe international trend and pop culture website Konbini called Candide a \"legend of freeskiing\" and noted that having no background music \"just the sound of infernal and interminable sliding\" made the video \"a hypnotic visual trip\" (16). The review on Fstoppers, the website of the online community of photographers and videographers read, \"Candide Thovex: legend. The French skier\u2019s latest cinematic marvel was released today, and it\u2019s the most epic action sports video of all time. Of. All. Time\".(24)\n\nReviews in the American specialized ski media were also complimentary. The magazine Ski entitled their article \u2018\"Ski the World\" Redefines Where Skiing is Possible' and wrote, \"you can\u2019t deny that Candide is still at the forefront of the ski world\". (19) Powder magazine started their report by calling Candide \"The reigning king of viral ski videos\" and explained that, \"While having only been online for 72 hours, the video has already garnered nearly a million views on YouTube, which comes as no surprise, as nearly every edit Candide has put out since his first \"One of Those Days\" videos in 2014 has instantly gone viral, even outside the ski community. His second OOTD edit currently sits at 22 million views on YouTube\" before concluding, \"his newest work confirms yet again why Candide is one of the greatest skiers of our time\" and called the film \"five minutes of skiing magic\". (20) Freeskier magazine said, \"Candide Thovex is actually an alien\" (22), and ski and snowboard film production company and media platform Teton Gravity Research called Candide \"otherworldly\" and wrote \"he accomplishes things on two planks beyond the realm of what most would think is humanly possible\" describing his performance in the video as \"ski wizardry\". (23)\n\nIn March 2018 \"[https://www.facebook.com/CandideThovex/videos/10155038627933204/ Ski The World]\" was entered into competition at the fourth edition of the New York City Drone Film Festival where it won the Extreme Sports and Best in Show categories. (28) It was also entered in the UK's ShAFF (Sheffield Adventure Film Festival) where it won three awards: silver in Best Film, silver in Best Adrenaline Film, and bronze in the Best Short Film category. (27)\n\n== Candide Invitational ==\nCandide is the organizer of the Candide Invitational in his hometown of La Clusaz, a competition which gathers freestyle skiing and snowboarding's best talents.\nThe event was first held in the La Balme area of La Clusaz in 2002, and was last held in 2007. There are constant rumours of a return.\n\nHe has appeared in many movies, notably the Rastafaride series.\n\n==Film appearances==\n*13\n*Propaganda\n*Royalty\n*Focused\n*Rastafaride 1\n*Rastafaride 2\n*Rastafaride 3: French Toast (2003)\n*Rastafaride 4: Special Delivery (2004)\n*Rastafaride 5: Pull Up (2005)\n*Rastafaride 6: Wha'ppen (2006)\n*Rastafaride 7: Seventh Heaven\n*Special Delivery\n*DVD Candide Invitational\n*Further\n*Anomaly\n*War\n*Candide Thovex Invitational Story\n*Lost and Found\n*Strike\n*Mind the Gap\n*Happy Dayz\n*Tangerine Dream\n*Candide Kamera\n*Candide Kamera 2\n*{{YouTube|id=cpi2fc5vfNs|title=Few Words \u2013 A Candide Thovex Film}}\n*{{youtube|ygxufRprWpY|One of those days \u2013 I}}\n*{{youtube|yKP7jQknGjs|One of those days \u2013 II}}\n*{{youtube|R1NagZN2kjY|One of those days \u2013 III}}\n*{{YouTube|id=E3zFEhrcAvU|title=THIS IS HOME \u2013 A Film by the Faction Collective}}\n\n==Competition results==\n1996\n*Mogul skiing winner of the French single championship\n1997\n*Mogul skiing winner of the French single and parallel championships\n1999:\n*4th X Games, Crested Butte, Colorado, Big Air\n\n2000:\n*1st X Games, Mount Snow, Vermont Big Air\n*1st Gravity Games, Mammoth Mountain, California, Big Air\n\n2002:\n*2nd US Open, Vail, Colorado, Superpipe\n*4th US Open, Vail, Colorado, Slopestyle\n*5th US Open, Vail, Colorado, Big Air\n*2nd World Skiing Invitational, Whistler, BC, Canada, Superpipe\n*1st Rip Curl Freeski, Saas Fee, SUI., Overall\n*2nd Rip Curl Freeski, Saas Fee, SUI., Halfpipe\n*1st Rip Curl Freeski, Saas Fee, SUI., Slopestyle\n*2nd Rip Curl Freeski, Saas Fee, SUI., Big Air\n*9th X Games, Aspen, Colorado, Slopestyle\n*4th X Games, Aspen, Colorado, Superpipe\n\n2003:\n*2nd World Superpipe Championships, Park City, UT., Halfpipe\n*5th X Games, Aspen, Colorado, Slopestyle\n*1st X Games, Aspen, Colorado, Superpipe\n\n2006:\n*1st Orage European Feeskiing Open, Laax, SUI., Superpipe\n\n2007:\n*1st.

He is notable for his creative freestyle skiing movies and professional accomplishments. He first caught the attention of the world of outdoor and action sports by jumping [[Chad's Gap]], a massive transfer jump of {{convert|120|ft|m}} from take-off to landing over a {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep gully in [[Alta Ski Area|Alta]], [[Utah]], US. His [[Point of view shot|point of view]] videos routinely go [[Viral video|viral]] on the internet and are viewed by millions. He is widely considered to be one of the best freeskiers in the history of the sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snowbrains.com/top-5-freeskiers-time/ |title=The Top 10 Freeskiers of All-Time |publisher=SnowBrains.com |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n===Early years===\nCandide Thovex was born 22 May 1982(37) in [[Annecy]], in the [[Haute-Savoie]] area of France, and grew up in the village of [[La Clusaz]].\n\nHe learned to ski at age 2.5 in the [[Aravis Range|Aravis]] region of the [[French Alps]]. As a 4-year-old, he began building little jumps behind his house, and at 5 he joined the local skier club where he developed a passion for [[Mogul skiing]]. He was 14 when he won his first French National Junior Championships in the mogul division. Even from a young age, he was described by those close to him as \"skiing with flair and innovation\".\n\nHe is the brother of snowboarder [[Mirabelle Thovex]].\n\n===Professional skiing (1997-2007 the freestyle years)===\nIn 1997 Candide signed his first professional sponsorship contract with leading Australian action sports brand [[Quiksilver]].\n\nIn 2000 Candide returned to the United States to compete in the Gravity Games in Mammoth, California, where he won the Big Air contest. He made his second visit to Chad's Gap and cleanly landed a D-spin 720<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tetongravity.com/video/ski/Throwback17yearold-Candide-Thovexthrowsthefirst-Dspin720over-Chads-Gap-997101|title=Throwback: 17-year-old Candide Thovex throws the first Dspin 720 over Chad\u2019s Gap|last=Dodge|first=Henry|date=23 April 2010|website=www.tetongravity.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> the first major rotation over a gap.\n\nFrom there 'the flying Frenchman' went on to win the Big Air division, his first gold medal at a Winter X-Games in the process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thovex airs it out for gold|url=http://espn.go.com/extreme/winterx00/s/skibigair0206.html}}</ref> Unfortunately his season ended with Candide blowing the cruciate ligaments in his left knee.\n\nIn the spring of 2001 Candide was invited to ride at Superpark 3 in Mammoth, California. Candide proceeded to impress his peers by sticking the 'jump heard around the world'; a 110-foot (33.5 meter) cork 540 tail grab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powder.com/stories/a-brief-history-of-superpark/ |title=Superpark Revisited: a history of the legendary proving ground |publisher=Powder.com |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> On the contest side of things, Candide won the Halfpipe and Big Air contests at that year's X Games in Australia. Candide's injury from the previous season had left him with plenty of down time. He took advantage of that to launch his career as a filmmaker and created 'WW Prod'. That same year his first production company went on to release the first of 8 films under the 'Rastafaride' title, selling more than 10 000 DVDs of the first video worldwide. He was also voted 'Skier of the Year' by the European specialized media.\n\n2002 was a very busy year. Candide was constantly filming with his own production company and with others. He continued competing and his contest results remained solid, dominating the Big Air events, winning two in New Zealand, one in Lebanon and another in Switzerland. He earned 2 podiums at the US Open; 2nd place in Superpipe, and 3rd place in Slopestyle.\n\nIn 2003 according to the Association of Freeskiing Professionals, \"Candide Thovex and CR Johnson change the face of halfpipe skiing at Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado by going bigger than any of the snowboarders.\"<ref>http://www.afpworldtour.com/rfs/clients/afp/resources/HistoryofFreeskiing_Timeline.pdf</ref> Candide won his second X-Games gold medal.<ref>[http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20090122/SPORTS/901229870/1059&title=Superpipe%20stunner%20in%20Aspen Superpipe stunner in Aspen]</ref> This time it was in Superpipe,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp__qrNtFX4 |title=X Games 2003: Candide Thovex |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-11-05 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> an incredible achievement, since he couldn't practice at home because at the time there weren't any superpipes in Europe.  Candide celebrated by hosting the first ever 'Candide Invitational' at his home resort, La Clusaz. The event gathered the world's best freestylers for a few days of fun and to explore the limits of what could be done on a pair of skis. He also signed a sponsorship deal to develop a pro model with Salomon. This was another season that ended with another injury to his cruciate ligaments, but this time in his right knee.\n\nIn 2004 Candide continued to push back the boundaries of his sport, performing the first ever '810\u00b0 to rail' and cementing his reputation as the master of all 'new school' tricks and techniques. He was part of Powder's Reader Poll in 2004 where he was placed 6th.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.powder.com/powder-awards-archive/2004-powder-awards-results/|title=2004 Powder Awards Results {{!}} POWDER Magazine|date=2009-11-07|work=POWDER Magazine|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the Candide Invitational event was voted best European freestyle event by the international specialised press. The same season Candide inked a multi-year deal with Rossignol to become the leading ambassador for their 'Scratch' program.\n\nIn 2006 Candide decided to see how high it was possible to fly on skis. To do so, he helped to design and build one of the largest quarter-pipes ever and proceeded to set a world record with a jump of 33 feet (about 10 meters) above the coping.<ref>{{youtube|x-hsYz58AAU|}}</ref>\n\n2007 was a year of highs and lows; Candide won his third gold medal at [[Winter X Games XI|2007 in Slopestyle]],<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/athlete/3013725/candide-thovex |title=Candide Thovex - X Games |publisher=Xgames.espn.go.com |accessdate=2015-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402153041/http://xgames.espn.go.com/athlete/3013725/candide-thovex |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xh37rl_candide-thovex-x-games-gold-slopestyle-2007_sport|title=Candide Thovex X GAMES gold slopestyle 2007}}</ref> with a record score of 95/100. However, he ended his season coming up short on 'The Big Bertha',<ref>{{youtube|KDjIPJBq97s|}}</ref> another over-the-top jump he'd dreamed up, which resulted in a fracture to his L1 vertebrae. At first, doctors thought he might never be able to ski again or at least that he would never ski at the same level as before; no more tricks, no more big airs.\n\n===Professional skiing (2008-2018 big mountain freestyle and filmmaking)===\nReturning from injury in 2008, Candide signed on to ride for Coreupt skis. He also put all his energy into his event, designing features of all shapes and sizes to blend in perfectly with the terrain. At the same time, he started skiing again, but only in perfect powder and far from the crowds. He rode alone, with the exception of his sole companion, Simon Favier who was there to capture all of the action on film. He didn't compete in a single contest.  He was simultaneously putting together his first documentary feature 'The Candide Invitational Story',.<ref>{{youtube|fWrjugaKetE|}}</ref>\n\nThe final product of his adventures riding and filming with Simon Favier was entitled 'Candide Kamera'<ref>{{youtube|B95Eq-5xCC8|}}</ref> and was released in 2009. The images were focused exclusively on riding in the backcountry and big mountain freestyle. Wanting to continue in the same vein, Candide spent the entire season riding powder and filming.\n\nAfter winning a number of major freestyle contests, 2010 marked a sensational return to competition, but now Candide had turned his sights on unspoiled and unforgiving backcountry faces. However, he wanted to keep things discreet since he hadn't competed since his injury. His comeback started with an invitation to compete in the Red Bull Line Catcher in Vars, France, a prestigious hybrid event, which blends freestyle and freeriding. He was nervous and unsure of his ability to keep up with the other competitors. In spite of his uncertainties, he went on to win the contest.<ref>{{youtube|uNQrWhxiYms|}}</ref> A few weeks later, Candide Thovex was invited to and won the Chamonix stage of the Freeride World Tour (FWT).<ref>{{youtube|Ajes1eq2itA|}}</ref> The win in Chamonix was a deciding factor that convinced him to compete on the tour for the entire season. He finished in second place at the following event.<ref name=\"Candide Thovex\">{{cite web|url=http://freerideworldtour.com/riders/candide-thovex |title=Candide Thovex |publisher=Freeride World Tour |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zapiks.com/candide-thovex-2-place-line--1.html |title=Candide Thovex - 2\u00b0 place line SKI - Nissan Russian Adventure by Swatch in Chamonix - Video |publisher=Zapiks.com |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> At the last event of the season, the Verbier Xtreme on the face of the infamous Bec des Rosses in Switzerland, Candide laid down a solid run for an equal 3rd-place finish.<ref>{{youtube|koM9dzThOSs|}}</ref> The result was just enough to clinch the title of World Freeride Champion.<ref>{{youtube|qisPjW5qkLc\\}}</ref><ref name=\"Candide Thovex\"/>\n\nCandide's fascination with the art of filmmaking has always entertained him. Over the course of his professional career he has starred in, and produced numerous videos. Including numerous video segments, Candide starred in WW production's Rastafaride 7th Heaven.  In 2011, he set to work on a project to document his past with an eye on what the future held in store for him. He skied and filmed the best backcountry conditions available on the planet.\n\nThe film 'Few Words' was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL2sCAvM29A |title=Few Words Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> It was an immediate success. The French cable TV channel Canal+ immediately purchased the exclusive rights to the film in Candide's home country for a period of 2 years, showing it a countless number of times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lezappingdupaf.com/article-few-words-documentaire-sur-le-ski-moderne-sur-canal-sport-115061699.html |title=Few Words, documentaire sur le ski moderne sur Canal+ Sport |publisher=Le zapping du PAF |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> It was also a bestseller worldwide on iTunes,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/few-words/id591603253 |title=iTunes - Movies - Few Words |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> and in 2013 received the highest honors on offer at the renowned Powder Awards put on by the American ski magazine of the same name; best male performance, best documentary, best cinematography, and the most prestigious of all, the \"Full Throttle\" award for the most outstanding all around performance of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grindtv.com/action-sports/snow/post/skier-candide-thovex-big-winner-at-powder-awards/ |title=Skier Candide Thovex big winner at Powder Awards |publisher=GrindTV.com |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> The film was also played to sold out theatres on a 24-country world tour.\nThe same year, Candide joined forces with [[The Faction Collective|Faction Skis]] to develop a complete range of signature models;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factionskis.com/collections/candide-collection |title=Collections &#124; Candide Collection |publisher=Faction Skis |accessdate=2015-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317094456/http://www.factionskis.com/collections/candide-collection |archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref> meanwhile all the products in his signature model line with longtime sponsor Quiksliver continued to be best sellers.\n\nCandide decided to devote his 2013 season to producing a new video entitled 'One of Those Days'<ref>{{youtube|ygxufRprWpY|}}</ref> filmed almost exclusively with his helmet-mounted camera. Filmed entirely from his point of view, 'One of Those Days' (OOTD) was claimed by Powder magazine editor John Clary Davies \"The best skier on the planet at his home hill. This is the most fun I\u2019ve ever had \nskiing and all I did was sit in my office and press play. Movie of the Year. Edit of the Century. Done\".\n\nReleased in January 2015, 'One of Those Days 2' pushed the boundaries even further.

Candide has also made live appearances on CNN and France's Canal+ to talk about the video, which has also featured in other televised reports on TF1, France2, and M6 in France, as well as 1TV in Russia, and on the leading European sports channel, Eurosport.\n\nOn 8 December 2015, Candide released an advertorial film for [[Audi]] to promote their latest Quattro Q7 model. The video, created, produced and directed by Candide, featured Candide skiing and performing tricks on many surfaces including dirt, grass, fallen leaves and asphalt, but no snow. It was viewed over 1 million times on the first day on Candide's YouTube channel.

Entitled quattro2 (25) and also known as \"[https://www.facebook.com/CandideThovex/videos/10155038627933204/ Ski The World]\", it is a travel adventure that required 9 months to research and scout appropriate locations. It was filmed over the course of 3 months at over 30 locations in 10 countries where Candide skied on a variety of surfaces, except snow: grass, sand, water, lava, stone, and different types of earth from jungle floor to mountains of gravelly dirt. After 2 months of post-production work the film was released on 22 January 2018. It was viewed over 65 million times in the first 2 weeks across all of Candide and Audi's social media channels. The background story of the video is featured on the Audi website (30).\n\nThe press coverage of the video from specialized and general sports websites, as well as lifestyle, business and mainstream news outlets was international, with reports in no less than 9 countries including: France (1)(2), Switzerland (3), Germany (4)(5), Spain (6), Greece (7)(8), Ireland (9), Great Britain (10)(11), Canada (12) and the United States (13)(14).\n\nFrance's leading sports media, L\u2019Equipe reminded its readers that Candide is \"the French skiing legend, from who each new video is an event\" (15), and the country's specialized ski website Skieur said, \"once again he wins his crazy bet to impress us, to make us forget his last video and to once again push back the limits of what is possible\" (17). The French language Swiss news website La C\u00f4te also mentioned Candide, \"setting the bar in the stratosphere\" in the title of its article and noted the viral performance of the video reporting that \"at 8pm, barely two hours after it had been posted online, the video had already been viewed more than 2.2 million times on his Facebook page and more than 2 million times on the specialized platform Zapiks\". (26)\n\nThe international trend and pop culture website Konbini called Candide a \"legend of freeskiing\" and noted that having no background music \"just the sound of infernal and interminable sliding\" made the video \"a hypnotic visual trip\" (16). The review on Fstoppers, the website of the online community of photographers and videographers read, \"Candide Thovex: legend. The French skier\u2019s latest cinematic marvel was released today, and it\u2019s the most epic action sports video of all time. Of. All. Time\".(24)\n\nReviews in the American specialized ski media were also complimentary. The magazine Ski entitled their article \u2018\"Ski the World\" Redefines Where Skiing is Possible' and wrote, \"you can\u2019t deny that Candide is still at the forefront of the ski world\". (19) Powder magazine started their report by calling Candide \"The reigning king of viral ski videos\" and explained that, \"While having only been online for 72 hours, the video has already garnered nearly a million views on YouTube, which comes as no surprise, as nearly every edit Candide has put out since his first \"One of Those Days\" videos in 2014 has instantly gone viral, even outside the ski community. His second OOTD edit currently sits at 22 million views on YouTube\" before concluding, \"his newest work confirms yet again why Candide is one of the greatest skiers of our time\" and called the film \"five minutes of skiing magic\". (20) Freeskier magazine said, \"Candide Thovex is actually an alien\" (22), and ski and snowboard film production company and media platform Teton Gravity Research called Candide \"otherworldly\" and wrote \"he accomplishes things on two planks beyond the realm of what most would think is humanly possible\" describing his performance in the video as \"ski wizardry\". (23)\n\nIn March 2018 \"[https://www.facebook.com/CandideThovex/videos/10155038627933204/ Ski The World]\" was entered into competition at the fourth edition of the New York City Drone Film Festival where it won the Extreme Sports and Best in Show categories.

[[Capital punishment in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\n\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' include: [[Minnesota]] in 1911, [[Capital punishment in Vermont|Vermont]] in 1964, [[Iowa]] and [[Capital punishment in West Virginia|West Virginia]] in 1965 and [[North Dakota]] in 1973. [[Hawaii]] abolished the death penalty in 1948 and [[Alaska]] in 1957, both before their statehood. [[Capital punishment in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] repealed it in 1929 and the [[Capital punishment in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by [[Suffrage|popular vote]] in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later;  Arizona reinstated the death penalty in 1918 and Oregon in 1978. In Oregon, the measure reinstating the death penalty was overturned by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1981, but Oregon voters again reinstated the death penalty in 1984.<ref name=\"Ballotpedia\">{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Death_penalty_on_the_ballot|title= Death penalty on the ballot |publisher= ballotpedia.org |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\n\n===Constitutional law developments===\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\", according to abolitionist [[Hugo Adam Bedau|Hugo Bedau]].<ref>The Courts, the Constitution, and Capital Punishment 118 (1977)</ref>\n\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided on ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'' in 1958. The Supreme Court declared explicitly, for the first time, that the Eighth Amendment's [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]] clause must draw its meaning from the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', the court made the first step of what would later be called \"death is different\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases \u2013 a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''.\n\n===Capital punishment suspended (1972)===\n{{Further|Furman v. Georgia}}In ''Furman v. Georgia'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \"unitary trial\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-''Furman'' execution was that of [[Luis Monge (mass murderer)|Luis Monge]] on June 2, 1967.\n\nIn a 5\u20134 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be ''per se'' unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of [[Byron White]] and [[Potter Stewart]], expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and [[William O. Douglas]] worried explicitly about [[Race and capital punishment in the United States|racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty]]. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe ''Furman'' decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \"legal bombshell\".<ref name=\"Latzer\"/> The next day, columnist [[Barry Schweid]] wrote that it was \"unlikely\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pAoQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3786,38609|title=The Free Lance-Star \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\n===Capital punishment reinstated (1976)===\n{{Further|Gregg v. Georgia}}\n[[File:Panorama of United States Supreme Court Building at Dusk.jpg|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court seat in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in ''Furman''. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his ''Furman'' opinion. Other states adopted \"bifurcated\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\n\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''<ref>''Gregg v. Georgia'', {{ussc|428|153|1976}}</ref> and upheld 7\u20132 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any [[mitigating factor]]s exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in ''[[Woodson v. North Carolina]]''<ref>''Woodson v. North Carolina'', {{ussc|428|280|1976}}</ref> and ''[[Roberts v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>''Roberts v. Louisiana'', {{ussc|428|325|1976}}, {{ussc|431|633|1977}}</ref> the court struck down 5\u20134 statutes providing a [[mandatory death penalty|mandatory death sentence]].\n\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when [[Gary Gilmore (criminal)|Gary Gilmore]] went before a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] in [[Utah]]. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\n\nFollowing the decision, the use of capital punishment in the United States soared.<ref name=\":2\" /> This was in contrast to trends in other parts of advanced industrial democracies where the use of capital punishment declined or was prohibited.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Supreme Court narrows capital offenses===\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for this offense.\n\nIn the 1980 case ''[[Godfrey v. Georgia]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise [[aggravating factor]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Godfrey v. Georgia |url= https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/420/ |publisher= supreme.justia.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', decided on June 20, 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html|title=DARYL RENARD ATKINS, PETITIONER v. VIRGINIA|accessdate=August 6, 2006|date=June 20, 2002}}</ref> held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]''<ref>''Roper v. Simmons'', {{ussc|543|551|2005}}</ref> struck down executions for offenders [[Capital punishment for juveniles in the United States|under the age of 18 at the time of the crime]].\n\nIn the 2008 case ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'', the court also held 5\u20134 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including [[child rape]]. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/25/scotus.child.rape/index.html|title=Child rapists can't be executed, Supreme Court rules|first=Bill|last=Mears|publisher=CNN|date=June 25, 2008|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] and was criticized by both major party candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |title=Obama Disagrees With High Court on Child Rape Case |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=June 25, 2008 |author=Sara Kugler |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524044856/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Repeal movements and legal challenges===\nIn 2004, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Kansas]] capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective states' highest courts.

A study by [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] published in ''[[Temple Law Review]]'', surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states.

This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria.

These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/489/288/case.html Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 306 (1989)].</ref> Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.11(b) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.11(a) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Most often, these are claims, such as [[ineffective assistance of counsel]], which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary [[appeal]]. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.<ref name=autogenerated1>Eric M.

Federal ''habeas corpus'' is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for [[certiorari]] to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal ''habeas corpus'' is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal ''habeas corpus'' is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal [[constitutional right]]s. Prisoners may also use federal ''habeas corpus'' suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.<ref>[[House v. Bell]], 126 S. Ct. 2064 (2006)</ref> According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal ''habeas corpus''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when ''habeas corpus'' petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\".<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DB1039F932A35757C0A960958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Habeas Corpus Studies | date=April 1, 1996 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in ''habeas corpus'' cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walpin|first1=Ned|title=The New Speed-up in Habeas Corpus Appeals|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/speed.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to ''habeas corpus'' review.\n\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.<ref>see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</ref>\n\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious ''habeas'' procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.<ref>28 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2261 \u2013 2266</ref> Under this program, federal ''habeas corpus'' for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the [[U.S. attorney general]], with a possible appeal of the state to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. {{as of|2016|March}}, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.<ref>{{cite web |title= Court Gives Green Light to Death Penalty Fast-Tracking |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-green-light-death-penalty-fast-tracking-37886309 |publisher= abcnews.go.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Section 1983===\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a [[writ]] of ''habeas corpus'', the death sentence ordinarily becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another avenue of federal litigation; the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] \u2013 codified at {{usc|42|1983}} \u2013 allows complainants to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nWhile direct appeals are normally limited to just one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-7955/ |title = Glossip v. Gross 576 U.S. ___ (2015) |publisher = justia.com |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that ''habeas corpus'', not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-6188.ZS.html |title=Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> In the 2006 ''[[Hill v. McDonough]]'' case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the ''Hill'' case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than ''habeas corpus'' to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as [[Clarence Hill (murderer)|Clarence Hill]]'s own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\n\n===Execution warrant===\nWhile the [[execution warrant]] is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\n\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.<ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Georgia Code \u2013 \u00a7 17-10-34 \u2013 Sentence to specify time period for and place of execution |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-17/chapter-10/article-2/section-17-10-34/ |publisher= law.justia.com |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution of sentences==\n[[File:Death sentences United States (new).png|thumb|right|300px| Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953 to 2008]]\nIn recent years there has been an average of one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions in the United States.\n\nAlabama has the highest ''per capita'' rate of death sentences.

And during his two terms (1979\u20131987) as [[Florida]]'s Governor, [[Bob Graham]], although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-''Furman'' involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality.\n\n==Moratorium on executions==\n[[File:Death penalty in the United States with hiatuses.svg|thumb|250px|{{legend|#4daf4a|Capital punishment repealed or struck down as unconstitutional}}{{legend|#377eb8|Capital punishment in statute, but executions formally suspended}}{{legend|#ffff33|Capital punishment in statute, but no recent executions}}{{legend|#984ea3|Capital punishment in statute, other unique circumstances apply}}{{legend|#e41a1c|Executions recently performed}}]]\nAll executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008.

[[Capital punishment in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\n\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' include: [[Minnesota]] in 1911, [[Capital punishment in Vermont|Vermont]] in 1964, [[Iowa]] and [[Capital punishment in West Virginia|West Virginia]] in 1965 and [[North Dakota]] in 1973. [[Hawaii]] abolished the death penalty in 1948 and [[Alaska]] in 1957, both before their statehood. [[Capital punishment in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] repealed it in 1929 and the [[Capital punishment in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by [[Suffrage|popular vote]] in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later;  Arizona reinstated the death penalty in 1918 and Oregon in 1978. In Oregon, the measure reinstating the death penalty was overturned by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1981, but Oregon voters again reinstated the death penalty in 1984.<ref name=\"Ballotpedia\">{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Death_penalty_on_the_ballot|title= Death penalty on the ballot |publisher= ballotpedia.org |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\n\n===Constitutional law developments===\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\", according to abolitionist [[Hugo Adam Bedau|Hugo Bedau]].<ref>The Courts, the Constitution, and Capital Punishment 118 (1977)</ref>\n\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided on ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'' in 1958. The Supreme Court declared explicitly, for the first time, that the Eighth Amendment's [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]] clause must draw its meaning from the \"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', the court made the first step of what would later be called \"death is different\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases \u2013 a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''.\n\n===Capital punishment suspended (1972)===\n{{Further|Furman v. Georgia}}In ''Furman v. Georgia'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \"unitary trial\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-''Furman'' execution was that of [[Luis Monge (mass murderer)|Luis Monge]] on June 2, 1967.\n\nIn a 5\u20134 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]]. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be ''per se'' unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of [[Byron White]] and [[Potter Stewart]], expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and [[William O. Douglas]] worried explicitly about [[Race and capital punishment in the United States|racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty]]. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[William J. Brennan Jr.]] expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe ''Furman'' decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \"legal bombshell\".<ref name=\"Latzer\"/> The next day, columnist [[Barry Schweid]] wrote that it was \"unlikely\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pAoQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3786,38609|title=The Free Lance-Star \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\n===Capital punishment reinstated (1976)===\n{{Further|Gregg v. Georgia}}\n[[File:Panorama of United States Supreme Court Building at Dusk.jpg|thumb|U.S. Supreme Court seat in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in ''Furman''. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his ''Furman'' opinion. Other states adopted \"bifurcated\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\n\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''<ref>''Gregg v. Georgia'', {{ussc|428|153|1976}}</ref> and upheld 7\u20132 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any [[mitigating factor]]s exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in ''[[Woodson v. North Carolina]]''<ref>''Woodson v. North Carolina'', {{ussc|428|280|1976}}</ref> and ''[[Roberts v. Louisiana]]'',<ref>''Roberts v. Louisiana'', {{ussc|428|325|1976}}, {{ussc|431|633|1977}}</ref> the court struck down 5\u20134 statutes providing a [[mandatory death penalty|mandatory death sentence]].\n\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when [[Gary Gilmore (criminal)|Gary Gilmore]] went before a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] in [[Utah]]. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\n\nFollowing the decision, the use of capital punishment in the United States soared.<ref name=\":2\" /> This was in contrast to trends in other parts of advanced industrial democracies where the use of capital punishment declined or was prohibited.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Supreme Court narrows capital offenses===\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for this offense.\n\nIn the 1980 case ''[[Godfrey v. Georgia]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise [[aggravating factor]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Godfrey v. Georgia |url= https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/420/ |publisher= supreme.justia.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', decided on June 20, 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html|title=DARYL RENARD ATKINS, PETITIONER v. VIRGINIA|accessdate=August 6, 2006|date=June 20, 2002}}</ref> held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]''<ref>''Roper v. Simmons'', {{ussc|543|551|2005}}</ref> struck down executions for offenders [[Capital punishment for juveniles in the United States|under the age of 18 at the time of the crime]].\n\nIn the 2008 case ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'', the court also held 5\u20134 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including [[child rape]]. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/25/scotus.child.rape/index.html|title=Child rapists can't be executed, Supreme Court rules|first=Bill|last=Mears|publisher=CNN|date=June 25, 2008|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] and was criticized by both major party candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |title=Obama Disagrees With High Court on Child Rape Case |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=June 25, 2008 |author=Sara Kugler |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524044856/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/WireStory?id=5246858&page=1 |archivedate=May 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Repeal movements and legal challenges===\nIn 2004, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Kansas]] capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective states' highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, who reinstated the statute in ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'' (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of the New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal.

This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \"special circumstances\", making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/transparency-death-penalty/ |title = Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice: An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\nA proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.<ref name=\"ReferenceGershowitz\">{{cite web |title= Statewide Capital Punishment: The Case for Eliminating Counties' Role in the Death Penalty |url= http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1255/ |accessdate= March 20, 2016 |author=Adam M.

If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand.<ref name=\"18USC3595\"/> If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing.<ref name=\"poland\">[http://supreme.justia.com/us/476/147/case.html Poland v.

These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/489/288/case.html Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 306 (1989)].</ref> Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.11(b) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.<ref>LaFave, Israel, & King, 6 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.11(a) (2d ed. 2007).</ref> Most often, these are claims, such as [[ineffective assistance of counsel]], which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary [[appeal]]. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.<ref name=autogenerated1>Eric M.

Federal ''habeas corpus'' is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for [[certiorari]] to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal ''habeas corpus'' is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal ''habeas corpus'' is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal [[constitutional right]]s. Prisoners may also use federal ''habeas corpus'' suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.<ref>[[House v. Bell]], 126 S. Ct. 2064 (2006)</ref> According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal ''habeas corpus''.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when ''habeas corpus'' petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\".<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0DB1039F932A35757C0A960958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Habeas Corpus Studies | date=April 1, 1996 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in ''habeas corpus'' cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walpin|first1=Ned|title=The New Speed-up in Habeas Corpus Appeals|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/speed.html|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}</ref> The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to ''habeas corpus'' review.\n\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.<ref>see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</ref>\n\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious ''habeas'' procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.<ref>28 USC \u00a7\u00a7 2261 \u2013 2266</ref> Under this program, federal ''habeas corpus'' for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the [[U.S. attorney general]], with a possible appeal of the state to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. {{as of|2016|March}}, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.<ref>{{cite web |title= Court Gives Green Light to Death Penalty Fast-Tracking |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-green-light-death-penalty-fast-tracking-37886309 |publisher= abcnews.go.com |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Section 1983===\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a [[writ]] of ''habeas corpus'', the death sentence ordinarily becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another avenue of federal litigation; the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] \u2013 codified at {{usc|42|1983}} \u2013 allows complainants to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nWhile direct appeals are normally limited to just one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-7955/ |title = Glossip v. Gross 576 U.S. ___ (2015) |publisher = justia.com |accessdate= March 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that ''habeas corpus'', not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-6188.ZS.html |title=Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> In the 2006 ''[[Hill v. McDonough]]'' case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the ''Hill'' case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than ''habeas corpus'' to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as [[Clarence Hill (murderer)|Clarence Hill]]'s own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\n\n===Execution warrant===\nWhile the [[execution warrant]] is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\n\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.<ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Georgia Code \u2013 \u00a7 17-10-34 \u2013 Sentence to specify time period for and place of execution |url=http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-17/chapter-10/article-2/section-17-10-34/ |publisher= law.justia.com |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution of sentences==\n[[File:Death sentences United States (new).png|thumb|right|300px| Total number of prisoners on Death Row in the United States from 1953 to 2008]]\nIn recent years there has been an average of one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions in the United States.\n\nAlabama has the highest ''per capita'' rate of death sentences.

Itching after contact with water, without the development of physical hives, is known as [[Aquagenic pruritus]]. [[Aquadynia]] is a condition in which pain occurs after contact with water.\n\nThe hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1\u20133&nbsp;mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body.  Once the water source is removed, the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22346281|pmc=3276800|year=2011|last1=Park|first1=H|title=Aquagenic urticaria: A report of two cases|journal=Annals of Dermatology|volume=23|issue=Suppl 3|pages=S371\u20134|last2=Kim|first2=H.

A strategy used by many to limit the severity of the hives is a change in diet. Becoming a vegetarian can be useful in restricting the amount of oil ones body will produce. Eating fruits and vegetables with a high water content has also been a successful prevention method. Drinking sodas has also had positive health effects.\n\n==Treatment==\nThere is currently no treatment that will permanently cure the condition. Avoidance of water is recommended as a first line of defense, and most treatments are palliative in nature rather than curative. Most people need to adjust their life style in order to cope with the symptoms.

The condition typically results from contact with water of any type, temperature or additive.\n\n==Signs and symptoms ==\nThe main symptom of aquagenic urticaria is the development of physical [[hives]], which may or may not itch. Itching after contact with water, without the development of physical hives, is known as [[Aquagenic pruritus]]. [[Aquadynia]] is a condition in which pain occurs after contact with water.\n\nThe hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small (approximately 1\u20133&nbsp;mm), red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges. It most commonly develops on the neck, upper trunk and arms, although it can occur anywhere on the body.

Death is inevitable. hello \nNo matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83\u201384|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99\u2013100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ({{cite quran|70|6\u20137|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==Suicide==\n{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}\nIslam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back.

Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 37</ref> Further the process of dying, extraction of one's soul from the body, is considered as painful.<ref>Amila Buturovic ''Carved in Stone, Etched in Memory: Death, Tombstones and Commemoration in Bosnian Islam Since C.1500'' Routledge 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-317-16957-4}} page 34</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Based on a hadith narrated in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] that at the time of death, [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] dipped his [[hand]]s in [[water]] and wiped his face with them saying, \"There is no God but Allah; indeed death has its stupour.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \n\nNevertheless, a common belief holds that true believers and the righteous, will welcome death, when it arrives.<ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 79</ref> Especially many modern writers assure that death is merely a transitional stage and do not adhere to the traditional depiction of death as painful or fearsome.<ref>Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 113</ref>\n\n==Period between death and Resurrection==\n{{main|Barzakh|Munkar and Nakir|Malakut|Azrael}}\nIslam hold different positions regarding the abode after the deceased. In the common Semitic view, man is a union of body and soul, and spirit not as a separate entity distinct from the body. The Quran itself refers to ''[[ruh]]'', later used to designate human's immortal self, not to the soul,<ref>Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 18</ref> but only to [[nafs]]. Muslims however, especially those influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], [[Mu\u02bftazila]], [[kalam|classical Islamic theology]], [[Shi'a]] and [[Sufis]], regarded ''ruh'' as to matter unrelated human's immortal spirit.<ref>Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 19</ref> Therefore, they distinguishes between ''nafs'' and ''ruh'', the latter surviving death.<ref>Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 20</ref>\n\nAccording to a hadith from [[Sahih Muslim]], Muhammad said: 'When the ruh (soul) is taken out, the eyesight follows it'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Oliver Leaman |encyclopedia= The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|title=Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&q=When+the+ruh+is+taken+out+the+eyesight+follows+it#v=snippet&q=When%20the%20ruh%20is%20taken%20out%20the%20eyesight%20follows%20it&f=false |year=2006 | page=171}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran itself gives only brief references about the period between death and the resurrection.

Being terrified, the soul desperately tries to hide itself in the body. Thereupon, the angels of death starts beating the soul and extracts it from the body in a most painful way.

The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth.

Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&pg=PA186 |title=Death|page=186}}</ref>\n\n==In the Quran==\nThe [[Quran]] at its several places discusses the issue of death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83\u201384|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99\u2013100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ({{cite quran|70|6\u20137|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==Suicide==\n{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}\nIslam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. This willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam.<ref name=Lester-2006/><ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&pg=PA641|title=Death |page=641}}</ref> Committing suicide to save oneself from suffering is discouraged.<ref name=Leaman-177/> Islam teaches that in the face of hardship, one should not directly pray for death. Instead, one should say: \"Oh Allah! Let me live as long as life is good for me, and let me die if death is good for me.\"<ref name=Leaman-177/> [[Euthanasia]] is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide.<ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

[[Karachi]]. Chapter 17, verse 33.</ref>\n\n==Akhirah==\n{{main|Akhirah}}\n\u0100khirah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629) is an Islamic term referring to the afterlife. It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's \u02be\u0101khirah lies in [[Jahannam]] (Hell) or [[Jannah]] (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic eschatology]]\n* [[Islamic funeral]]\n* [[Punishment of the Grave]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Islam and death| ]]\n[[Category:Islamic eschatology]]\n[[Category:Afterlife]]\n", "name_user": "96.236.33.12", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eIn the Quran)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_view_of_death"}
