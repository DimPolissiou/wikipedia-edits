Beach 4.jpg|thumb|Beaches are a common visit among residents and tourists alike in a Sydney summer ([[Bondi Beach]]).]] \nSummer in Sydney tends to vary, but it is generally warm to hot.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Josephine|title=Dreamtime superhighway an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange|date=2008|publisher=ANU E Press|location=Canberra, A.C.T.|isbn=9781921536175|page=11}}</ref> The western suburbs are [[microclimate|significantly hotter]] than the Sydney CBD by {{convert|2|-|5|C-change|0}} due to urban sprawl exacerbating the urban heat island effect and less exposure to mitigating sea breezes. In extreme occasions, the coast would have a temperature of {{convert|25|C|F}} with a [[sea breeze]], while a suburb {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} inland bakes in {{convert|38|C|F}} heat. At times, sea breezes do eventually reach the inland suburbs later in the day and would moderate the temperatures and raise humidity. Temperatures tend to be stable in late summer where they rarely go below {{convert|21|C|F}} or over {{convert|40|C|F}}, unlike late spring and early summer where such extremes would occur.<ref name=\"acnoh\"/> The far-western suburbs, which lie on the foothills of [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], have a [[F\u00f6hn effect]] originating from the [[Great Dividing Range]], where the lifting of the warm, dry winds originating from [[Central Australia]] over the Blue Mountains forces the air to descend into the Sydney region, thus becoming hotter by the time it reaches the metropolitan area, namely in the west (providing it isn't cooled by the sea breeze further east).<ref>Sharples, J.J.

Furthermore, most mornings and nights would be muggy, with the 9am relative humidity ranging from 69% to 75%.<ref name=\"acnoh\"/><ref name=\"acnli\"/> The average 3pm [[dewpoint]] temperature in the [[summer]] ranges from {{convert|16.2|C}} at the coast, to {{convert|14.4|C}} inland. Dewpoints would be higher in late summer, reaching {{convert|20|C}}, especially in the mornings and evenings, although they would usually be lower in the heat of the day, dipping as low as {{convert|9|C}} in the extremely hot day.<ref>Torok, S. and Nicholls, N. 1996. A historical annual temperature dataset for Australia. Aust. Met. Mag., 45, 251\u201360.</ref>\n\nIn late spring and summer, Sydney can sometimes get northwesterly winds from the [[Outback]], which are dry and hot, making the temperatures soar above {{convert|38|C|0}}, with the [[relative humidity]] as low as 15%.

T. A. Browne, who kept weather observations, noted that \"the years 1836, 1837 and 1838 were years of [[drought]], and in one of these years (1836) a remarkable thing happened. There was a fall of snow; we made [[snowball]]s at [[Enmore, New South Wales|Enmore]] and enjoyed the usual schoolboy amusements therewith\". The ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Herald]]'' reported on the same incident, saying, \"for the first time in the memory of the oldest inhabitants, snow fell in Sydney on the morning of Tuesday last. 27 June 1836, about 7 o'clock in the morning, a drifting fall covered the streets nearly one inch in depth.\"<ref>MacDonnell, Freda. Thomas Nelson (Australia) Limited, 1967.

Despite the reputation though, there are only around five snowy days per year in the upper mountains area with two settled falls per season, and another five to ten days of light [[Rain and snow mixed|snow shower]]s or sleet. Settled snow has become less common in recent decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Blackheath/2005/02/17/1108500192770.html| title=Blackheath|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref> It is extremely rare to see snow below [[Lawson, New South Wales|Lawson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_063039.shtml |title=Climate Statistics for Australian Locations |year=2011 |work=web page |publisher=Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Wind==\nAveraging at {{convert|13.8|km/h|abbr=on}}, November is the windiest month, whilst March is the calmest at {{convert|11.3|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"acnoh\"/> The [[Prevailing winds|prevailing wind]] annually is northeasterly.

Westerlies are dominant in late winter to mid-spring. Southerly busters are expected from November to the end of February. They typically look like as if a sheet of cloud is rolled up like a scroll by the advancing wind. The change of wind (in the warm months) is sometimes very sudden, where it may be fresh northeasterly and in ten minutes a southerly gale.\n\nWhen the [[subtropical ridge]] is north of Sydney in the second half of the year (spring), the wind would come from the west or inland. As the ridge moves south in late summer and autumn, the winds become easterly and, because they are coming off the [[Tasman Sea]], they are moist. It is usually at this time of the year (autumn to early winter) where rainfall would be the highest.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/sydney-weather-fog-shrouds-city-before-the-sun-finally-emerges-20150504-ggu2mx.html Sydney weather: fog shrouds city before the sun finally emerges]</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/sydney-weather-planes-diverted-ferries-cancelled-as-city-blanketed-in-fog-20150710-gia0p3.html Sydney weather: Planes diverted, ferries cancelled as city blanketed in fog]</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Wind direction in Sydney from 2002 to 2012 (average values) \n|-\n|North\n|Northeast\n|East\n|South East\n|Southern\n|Southwest\n|West\n|Northwest\n|-\n|5.9%\n|16.9%\n|14.1%\n|14.6%\n|24.9%\n|4.1%\n|11.9%\n|7.6%\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |  ''Source: [https://world-weather.info/archive/australia/sydney/ world-weather.info]''\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Drought==\n{{see also|Federation Drought|1979\u201383 Eastern Australian drought|2000s Australian drought}}\n[[File:Sydney bushfire.jpg|thumb|left|Smoke from bushfires around Sydney, January 1994.]] \nSydney's climate appears to be becoming drier; The city has had fewer rain days in recent years than shown in the long-term climate table above. In summer, Sydney can go for long periods without rainfall. The other phenomenon that arises from these long, dry and hot periods is bushfires, which occur frequently in the areas surrounding the city. [[Water supply]] is a recurring concern for the city during drought periods. In 2005 the [[reservoir]]s reached an all-time low. However, water levels since then have recovered in 2013.\n\nMany areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires, notably in 1994 and [[Black Christmas bushfires|2001\u201302]] \u2014 these tend to occur during the spring and summer. Heatwaves, which are regularly occurring in recent years, would usually lead to [[Water restrictions in Australia|water restrictions]] and a high risk of [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]], which sometimes bring a smoky [[haze]] to the city.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms.

He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club.

She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms.

He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club.

He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

If the film suffers at all it is from being almost too abstract, too chiaroscuro, unlightened with dialogue as was ''The Street'', or broken into the clearly divided planes - the snow and the sea - of ''The Owl and the Goose''. But style expresses subject and at the end, when the possibility of logic is swallowed up by the blackness, there is only the sense of a powerful, disturbing vision.<ref name=\"Bernie\" /></blockquote> Paul Wells, citing Hungarian animator [[John Halas]] (1987){{refn|group=note|name=first|''Masters of Animation'' London: BBC Books.}} reports that, along with Leaf's other films made in the 1970s, ''Mr. Samsa'' \"consolidated her place as one of the acknowledged \"masters\" of animation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=Paul |title=Animation: Genre and Authorship |date=2002 |publisher=Wallflower Press |location=London and New York |isbn=1903364205 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KNmlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&dq=mr.+samsa+consolidated+her+place&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL8OvHiuPjAhVJj1QKHTMlB6MQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=mr.%20samsa%20consolidated%20her%20place&f=false |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nLuc Perrault said Leaf's adaptation of Kafka's story was simply the best in any medium.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Perrault |first1=Luc |title=Un proc\u00e8s qui fera date |work=La Presse |date=28 August 1993 |language=French}}</ref> Contrastingly, [[Caryn James]], reviewing a retrospective exhibition spanning twenty-three years of Leaf's work for ''[[The New York Times]]'', felt the short did not do justice to Kafka's story: \"Leaf seems to be illustrating the story, not reimagining the terror of a man turned into a beetle ...

When Gregor wakes up, his room is his bedroom but as the animation continues its door becomes a barrier that separates him from the other members of the family. As the technique of the animation metamorphoses so easily between Gregor and his parents on the other side of the door, a paradox emerges. The frequently effortless shifts between the spaces exist in tension with Gregor's entrapment, making his imprisonment appear all the more profound.<ref name=\"Wood\"/></blockquote> In an article on distortion of spatial orientation in animation, which Ryan Pierson calls \"whole-screen metamorphosis,\" Pierson remarks that the film \"dissolves the sense of ground that is needed to support an impression of world, in a kind of becoming-animal of the camera.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pierson |first1=Ryan |title=Whole-Screen Metamorphosis and the Imagined Camera (Notes on Perspectival Movement in Animation) |journal=Animation |date=February 2015 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=6\u201321 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276832298_Whole-Screen_Metamorphosis_and_the_Imagined_Camera_Notes_on_Perspectival_Movement_in_Animation |accessdate=27 July 2019 |format=abstract}}</ref> [[Giannalberto Bendazzi]] calls the animation \"masterful\", appreciating how the film is constantly changing perspective, \"sometimes focusing on the protagonist's subjective understanding of his new condition.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bendazzi |first1=Giannalberto |title=Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style -

If the film suffers at all it is from being almost too abstract, too chiaroscuro, unlightened with dialogue as was ''The Street'', or broken into the clearly divided planes - the snow and the sea - of ''The Owl and the Goose''. But style expresses subject and at the end, when the possibility of logic is swallowed up by the blackness, there is only the sense of a powerful, disturbing vision.<ref name=\"Bernie\" /></blockquote> Paul Wells, citing Hungarian animator [[John Halas]] (1987){{refn|group=note|name=first|''Masters of Animation'' London: BBC Books.}} reports that, along with Leaf's other films made in the 1970s, ''Mr. Samsa'' \"consolidated her place as one of the acknowledged \"masters\" of animation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=Paul |title=Animation: Genre and Authorship |date=2002 |publisher=Wallflower Press |location=London and New York |isbn=1903364205 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KNmlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&dq=mr.+samsa+consolidated+her+place&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL8OvHiuPjAhVJj1QKHTMlB6MQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=mr.%20samsa%20consolidated%20her%20place&f=false |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nLuc Perrault said Leaf's adaptation of Kafka's story was simply the best in any medium.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Perrault |first1=Luc |title=Un proc\u00e8s qui fera date |work=La Presse |date=28 August 1993 |language=French}}</ref> Contrastingly, [[Caryn James]], reviewing a retrospective exhibition spanning twenty-three years of Leaf's work for ''[[The New York Times]]'', felt the short did not do justice to Kafka's story: \"Leaf seems to be illustrating the story, not reimagining the terror of a man turned into a beetle ...

When Gregor wakes up, his room is his bedroom but as the animation continues its door becomes a barrier that separates him from the other members of the family. As the technique of the animation metamorphoses so easily between Gregor and his parents on the other side of the door, a paradox emerges. The frequently effortless shifts between the spaces exist in tension with Gregor's entrapment, making his imprisonment appear all the more profound.<ref name=\"Wood\"/></blockquote> In an article on distortion of spatial orientation in animation, which Ryan Pierson calls \"whole-screen metamorphosis,\" Pierson remarks that the film \"dissolves the sense of ground that is needed to support an impression of world, in a kind of becoming-animal of the camera.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pierson |first1=Ryan |title=Whole-Screen Metamorphosis and the Imagined Camera (Notes on Perspectival Movement in Animation) |journal=Animation |date=February 2015 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=6\u201321 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276832298_Whole-Screen_Metamorphosis_and_the_Imagined_Camera_Notes_on_Perspectival_Movement_in_Animation |accessdate=27 July 2019 |format=abstract}}</ref> [[Giannalberto Bendazzi]] calls the animation \"masterful\", appreciating how the film is constantly changing perspective, \"sometimes focusing on the protagonist's subjective understanding of his new condition.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bendazzi |first1=Giannalberto |title=Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style -
