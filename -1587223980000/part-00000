The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers. He who seizes land gifted by himsolf or by others is borm as a worm in ordure for 60,000 years. Whoever destroys this gift will incur the sin of killing tawny cows on the banks of the [[Ganges]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501532|title=Annual Report Of The Mysore Archaeological Department, For The Year 1930|first=M.H.|last=Krishna|date=1934|language=english}}</ref>\n\n'''Note'''\n\nThis is a record registering the grant of a village called Kavahalli or Kalihalli (same as the present village Kahalli) for services in the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad on the Kaveri river in T.-Narsipur Taluk, Mysore District. It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n\n* During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers.

It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n\n* During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

\u767d\u6c99\u2013\u699c\u9e45\u96c6\u9009\u533a) is a six-member [[Group Representation Constituency]] (GRC) in the [[North-East Region, Singapore|north-eastern]] region of [[Singapore]]. The constituency consists of [[Pasir Ris]], [[Punggol]] and Compassvale in central [[Sengkang]] and small sections of [[Tampines]]. Formed during the [[2001 Singapore general election|2001 general election]] as a five-member GRC, it has been held by the [[People's Action Party]] ever since. With the growth in population of [[Punggol New Town]] and [[Sengkang New Town]], the GRC grew from a five-member GRC to a six-member GRC prior to the [[2006 Singapore general election|2006 elections]]. In 2011, Punggol East was carved out as a [[Punggol East SMC|SMC]] while the Punggol West division was formed, and in 2015, parts of Buangkok and Hougang (of the Punggol South division) were split off into [[Ang Mo Kio GRC]], while the northern portions of Punggol were formed to create the division of Punggol Coast, retaining its six seats.\n\nIts first contest happened in 2006 with the opponent being [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]]. For the [[2011 Singapore general election|2011 general election]], the incumbent [[People's Action Party]] announced that their team would be led by Teo Chee Hean, and include then-Senior Parliamentary Secretary [[Teo Ser Luck]], [[Penny Low]], as well as new candidates [[Janil Puthucheary]], [[Gan Thiam Poh]] and [[Zainal Sapari]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ramesh|first=S|title=GE: PAP announces election line-up|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1123709/1/.html|accessdate=21 April 2011|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|date=19 April 2011}}</ref> In the [[2015 Singaporean general election|2015 general election]], Penny Low retired from politics and new candidates [[Ng Chee Meng]] and [[Sun Xueling]] joined the team.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Chew|first=Hui Min|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pap-introduces-2-new-faces-in-pasir-ris-punggol-team-ex-defence-chief-ng-chee-meng-sun|title=PAP introduces 2 new faces in Pasir Ris-Punggol team: Ex-defence chief Ng Chee Meng, Sun Xueling|date=22 August 2015|work=The Straits Times|access-date=19 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, the GRC is reduced to five members, with [[Punggol West Single Member Constituency|Punggol West SMC]] carved out from the current boundaries and the Sengkang Central ward becomes the founding constituency for the brand new [[Sengkang Group Representation Constituency|Sengkang GRC]], along with previous divisions of Punggol East and Sengkang South.
